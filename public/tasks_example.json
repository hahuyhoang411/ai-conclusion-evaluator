    "referenceConclusion": "The meta-analysis of these studies indicates a significant positive effect, with a combined odds ratio of 2.5 (95% CI, 1.8-3.2). However, significant heterogeneity was observed (IÂ² = 78%), suggesting caution in interpretation. Future research should focus on stratified populations.",

      "conclusionA": "Based on the abstracts, there is a strong positive effect. The odds ratio is 2.5. The confidence interval is 1.8 to 3.2. There was a lot of heterogeneity.",
      "conclusionB": "A comprehensive review of the provided abstracts suggests a statistically significant positive effect. Key limitations include the high heterogeneity across studies, which necessitates cautious interpretation of the results."

      "Abstract 1: A randomized controlled trial examining the efficacy of intervention X showed significant improvement in primary outcomes (p<0.001) among participants aged 18-65.",

    "referenceConclusion": "The intervention demonstrates robust efficacy across multiple outcomes with sustained long-term benefits. While generally well-tolerated, clinicians should monitor for transient side effects during initial treatment phases. The intervention shows particular promise for subgroup Y populations.",

      "conclusionA": "The intervention works well and has long-term benefits. There are some side effects but they go away quickly. It works especially well for certain groups of people.",
      "conclusionB": "Evidence supports the intervention's effectiveness with significant primary outcome improvements (p<0.001). Notable efficacy in subgroup Y with moderate to large effect sizes. Sustained 12-month benefits observed, with mild, self-resolving side effects reported."
