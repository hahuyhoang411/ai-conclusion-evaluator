      "sourcePaperId": 35280900,
      "referenceConclusion": "In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggested that a higher dose of rifampin could significantly increase the pharmacokinetic parameters containing plasma and CSF concentration and the plasma AUC 0−24 , without a remarkable increase of adverse reactions. This phenomenon may indicate the idea that the crucial drug in the antituberculosis regimen was used in a low dose, more studies are required to shed light on this question. However, we found that there was no improvement in the treatment outcome. In terms of efficacy, more work will need to be done, especially large sample size phase III studies to determine the effect of an intensified regimen including a higher dose of rifampin.",

        "# Title: Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Phase II Dose-Finding Study To Evaluate High-Dose Rifampin for Tuberculous Meningitis.\n# Abstract: High doses of rifampin may help patients with tuberculous meningitis (TBM) to survive. Pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic evaluations suggested that rifampin doses higher than 13 mg/kg given intravenously or 20 mg/kg given orally (as previously studied) are warranted to maximize treatment response. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase II trial, we assigned 60 adult TBM patients in Bandung, Indonesia, to standard 450 mg, 900 mg, or 1,350 mg (10, 20, and 30 mg/kg) oral rifampin combined with other TB drugs for 30 days. The endpoints included pharmacokinetic measures, adverse events, and survival. A double and triple dose of oral rifampin led to 3- and 5-fold higher geometric mean total exposures in plasma in the critical early days (2 ±1) of treatment (area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h [AUC0-24], 53.5 mg · h/liter versus 170.6 mg · h/liter and 293.5 mg · h/liter, respectively; P <0.001), with proportional increases in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations and without an increase in the incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events. The 6-month mortality was 7/20 (35%), 9/20 (45%), and 3/20 (15%) in the 10-, 20-, and 30-mg/kg groups, respectively (P =0.12). A tripling of the standard dose caused a large increase in rifampin exposure in plasma and CSF and was safe. The survival benefit with this dose should now be evaluated in a larger phase III clinical trial. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under identifier NCT02169882.).",
        "# Title: Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Intensive Antituberculosis Treatment of Tuberculous Meningitis.\n# Abstract: The most effective antituberculosis drug treatment regimen for tuberculous meningitis is uncertain. We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing standard treatment with a regimen intensified by rifampin 15 mg/kg and levofloxacin for the first 60 days. The intensified regimen did not improve survival or any other outcome. We therefore conducted a nested pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study in 237 trial participants to define exposure-response relationships that might explain the trial results and improve future therapy. Rifampin 15 mg/kg increased plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) exposures compared with 10 mg/kg: day 14 exposure increased from 48.2 hour·mg/L (range 18.2-93.8) to 82.5 hour·mg/L (range 8.7-161.0) in plasma and from 3.5 hour·mg/L (range 1.2-9.6) to 6.0 hour·mg/L (range 0.7-15.1) in CSF. However, there was no relationship between rifampin exposure and survival. In contrast, we found that isoniazid exposure was associated with survival, with low exposure predictive of death, and was linked to a fast metabolizer phenotype. Higher doses of isoniazid should be investigated, especially in fast metabolizers.",

Little safety or pharmacokinetic (PK) data exist on high-dose rifampicin in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection, and no cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) PK data exist from Africa. We hypothesized that high-dose rifampicin would increase serum and CSF concentrations without excess toxicity.",
        "# Title: Plasma Pharmacokinetics of High-Dose Oral versus Intravenous Rifampicin in Patients with Tuberculous Meningitis: a Randomized Controlled Trial.\n# Abstract: Higher doses of intravenous rifampicin may improve outcomes in tuberculous meningitis but are impractical in high-burden settings. We hypothesized that plasma rifampin exposures would be similar between oral dosing of 35 mg/kg of body weight and intravenous dosing of 20 mg/kg, which has been proposed for efficacy trials in tuberculous meningitis. We performed a randomized parallel-group pharmacokinetic study nested within a clinical trial of intensified antimicrobial therapy for tuberculous meningitis. HIV-positive participants with tuberculous meningitis were recruited from South African hospitals and randomized to one of three rifampicin dosing groups: standard (oral 10 mg/kg), high dose (oral 35 mg/kg), and intravenous (20 mg/kg). Intensive pharmacokinetic sampling was done on day 3. Data were described using noncompartmental analysis, and exposures were compared by geometric mean ratios (GMRs). Forty-six participants underwent pharmacokinetic sampling (standard dose, n =17; high-dose oral, n =15; intravenous, n =14). The median CD4 count was 130 cells/mm3 (interquartile range [IQR], 66 to 253 cells/mm3). The rifampicin geometric mean area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC0-24) values were 42.9 μg · h/ml (95% confidence interval [CI], 24.5 to 75.0 μg · h/ml) for the standard dose, 295.2 μg · h/ml (95% CI, 189.9 to 458.8 μg · h/ml) for the high oral dose, and 206.5 μg · h/ml (95% CI, 154.6 to 275.8 μg · h/ml) for intravenous administration. The rifampicin AUC0-24 GMR was 1.44 (90% CI, 0.84 to 2.21) and the maximal concentration of drug in serum (Cmax) GMR was 0.89 (90% CI, 0.63 to 1.23) for high-dose oral administration with respect to intravenous dosing. The plasma rifampicin AUC0-24 was higher after an oral 35-mg/kg dose than with intravenous administration at a 20-mg/kg dose over the first few days of tuberculosis (TB) treatment. The findings support oral rifampicin dosing in future tuberculous meningitis trials."
