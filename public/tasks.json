    "referenceConclusion": "The current meta-analysis demonstrated the usefulness of serum ferritin measurement and iron staining in the grafted liver for evaluating the probability of infection and predicting mortality in patients undergoing LT. Additional research is necessary to determine whether this new strategy can further inform targeted intervention strategies to reduce the risk of infection and death in liver transplant recipients. Furthermore, future research should examine the risks of adverse events associated with iron overload in LT.",

      "# Title: Iron overload in cirrhosis-HFE genotypes and outcome after liver transplantation.\n# Abstract: Previously, we found appreciable hepatic iron deposition in one third of our patients undergoing liver transplantation (LTx) with approximately 10% of cases having quantifiable iron in the range of that seen in hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC). The aim of this study was to compare clinical outcome in liver transplant patients with and without iron overload. We also sought to determine the prevalence of HFE mutations in liver transplant patients with iron overload. Of 456 consecutive liver transplants, 41 explants had an hepatic iron index (HII) greater than 1.9, and these cases were compared to 41 matched liver transplant recipients without increased hepatic iron. Posttransplantation complications, along with patient and graft survival were monitored. HFE gene testing was performed using DNA-based techniques. Kaplan-Meier 5-year patient survival after LTx was significantly lower in cases with hepatic iron overload compared to matched controls without iron excess (48% vs. 77%; P =.045). Fatal infections (especially fungal) were more common in patients with iron overload (24% vs. 7%; P =.03). Of the 41 patients with a liver explant HII greater than 1.9, only 4 were C282Y homozygotes. Patients with severe hepatic explant iron overload undergoing LTx have a reduced survival compared to liver transplant recipients without explant iron excess. The reduced survival was attributable mainly to fatal bacterial and fungal infections. Despite the iron overload, HFE gene mutations were uncommon in patients with hepatic explant hemosiderosis.",
      "# Title: Association of hepatic iron overload with invasive fungal infection in liver transplant recipients.\n# Abstract: Invasive fungal infection is a serious complication of orthotopic liver transplantation, but its risk factors remain incompletely defined. Iron overload has already been associated with increased risk of fungal infections, but it has not yet been assessed as a risk factor in liver transplantation. We retrospectively studied a cohort of 153 consecutive patients who underwent their first liver transplantation at a single center and who survived at least 7 days after transplantation. The association between various pretransplant patient characteristics, including hepatic explant iron and risk of invasive fungal infections, was analyzed by univariate and multivariate models. Iron in the hepatic explant was assessed by Perl's Prussian blue stain by a pathologist blinded to clinical outcome. During the first year after transplantation, 28 of 153 patients developed a total of 31 invasive fungal infections, of which 21 (68%) were caused by Candida, 7 (23%) by Aspergillus, 2 (6%) by Cryptococcus, and 1 (3%) by Saccharomyces. Stainable iron in the hepatic explant was found in 48 patients (31%). Stainable iron in the hepatic explant was found to be strongly and independently associated with posttransplantation fungal infections in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 3.09; 95% confidence interval 1.45-6.56; P = 0.003). Hepatic iron overload is strongly and independently associated with posttransplantation invasive fungal infections. Studies to confirm this finding in other centers and define the mechanism are warranted.",
      "# Title: Serum ferritin concentration predicts mortality in patients awaiting liver transplantation.\n# Abstract: Additional markers are required to identify patients on the orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) waiting list at increased risk of death and adverse clinical events. Serum ferritin concentration is a marker of varied pathophysiological events and is elevated with increased liver iron concentration, hepatic necroinflammation, and systemic illness, all of which may cause a deterioration in liver function and clinical status. The aim of this study was to determine whether serum ferritin concentration is an independent prognostic factor in subjects awaiting OLT. This is a dual-center retrospective study. The study cohort consisted of 191 consecutive adults with cirrhosis accepted by the Queensland (Australia) Liver Transplant Service between January 2000 and June 2006 and a validation cohort of 131 patients from University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Transplant Center. In the study cohort, baseline serum ferritin greater than 200 microg/L was an independent factor predicting increased 180-day and 1-year waiting list mortality. This effect was independent of model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), hepatocellular carcinoma, age, and sex. Subjects with higher serum ferritin had increased frequency of liver-related clinical events. The relationship between serum ferritin and waiting list mortality was confirmed in the UCLA cohort; all deceased patients had serum ferritin greater than 400 microg/L. Serum ferritin greater than 500 microg/L and MELD were independent risk factors for death.",

      "# Title: Serum ferritin concentration and transferrin saturation before liver transplantation predict decreased long-term recipient survival.\n# Abstract: Serum ferritin (SF) concentration is a widely available parameter used to assess iron homeostasis. It has been described as a marker to identify high-risk patients awaiting liver transplantation (LT) but is also elevated in systemic immune-mediated diseases, metabolic syndrome, and in hemodialysis where it is associated with an inferior prognosis. This study analyzed whether SF is not only a predictor of liver-related mortality prior to LT but also an independent marker of survival following LT. In a dual-center, retrospective study, a cohort of 328 consecutive first-LT patients from Hannover Medical School, Germany (2003-2008, follow-up 1260 days), and 82 consecutive LT patients from Regensburg University Hospital, Germany (2003-2007, follow-up 1355 days) as validation cohort were analyzed. In patients exhibiting SF ≥365 μg/L versus <365 μg/L prior to LT, 1-, 3-, and 5-year post-LT survival was 73.3% versus 81.1%, 64.4% versus 77.3%, and 61.1% versus 74.4%, respectively (overall survival P = 0.0097), which was confirmed in the validation cohort (overall survival of 55% versus 83.3%, P = 0.005). Multivariate analyses identified SF ≥365 μg/L combined with transferrin saturation (TFS) <55%, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the survival after LT (SALT) score as independent risk factors for death. In patients with SF concentrations ≥365 μg/L and TFS <55%, overall survival was 54% versus 74.8% in the remaining group (P = 0.003). In the validation cohort, it was 28.6% versus 72% (P = 0.017), respectively.",
      "# Title: The association of pretransplant ferritin level with waiting list and post-transplant survival. Does ferritin actually predict outcome?\n# Abstract: Recent data suggest an association of serum ferritin (SF) with waiting list (WL) and postliver transplant (LT) outcomes. To assess the predictive capacity of SF on pre- and post-LT outcomes, and to identify whether recipient or donor liver siderosis is associated with post-LT survival; a retrospective analysis of 1079 patients assessed for first LT, 2000-2007 was performed. Iron deposition in the liver tissue was assessed using a semi-quantitative grading system. Median age was 54 (18-82) years and 67% were male. Seventeen per cent had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Median Model for End-stage Liver Disease MELD score was 14 (6-40), ferritin was 174 μg/l (4-4597) with 36.5% had a SF ≥ μg/l. Age (OR = 1.028) and MELD score (OR = 1.158) were independently associated with WL mortality (P < 0.001), whilst SF was not (P = NS). Age (OR = 1.018), HCC (OR = 1.542) and cold ischemia time (CIT) ≥ 10 h (OR = 1.418) were independently associated with post-LT survival (P < 0.05). Explant siderosis grade <2 was seen in 376 (71.7%) patients. Patients with explant siderosis grade ≥ 2 had inferior 12-month post-LT survival (P = 0.030). Presence of graft siderosis (15.8% of patients) was not associated with survival. In conclusion, we found a limited role for SF as a prognostic indicator for pre- or post-transplant survival.",
      "# Title: Iron-related markers are associated with infection after liver transplantation.\n# Abstract: Though serum iron has been known to be associated with an increased risk of infection, hepcidin, the major regulator of iron metabolism, has never been systematically explored in this setting. Finding early biomarkers of infection, such as hepcidin, could help identify patients in whom early empiric antimicrobial therapy would be beneficial. We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients (n = 128) undergoing first-time, single-organ orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) without known iron overload disorders at 2 academic hospitals in Boston from August 2009 to November 2012. Cox regression compared the associations between different iron markers and the development of first infection at least 1 week after OLT; 47 (37%) patients developed a primary outcome of infection at least 1 week after OLT and 1 patient died. After adjusting for perioperative bleeding complications, number of hospital days, and hepatic artery thrombosis, changes in iron markers were associated with the development of infection post-OLT including increasing ferritin (hazard ratio [HR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-2.05), rising ferritin slope (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.17), and increasing hepcidin (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.05-1.93). A decreasing iron (HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.20-2.57) and a decreasing iron slope (HR, 4.21; 95% CI, 2.51-7.06) were also associated with subsequent infections. In conclusion, hepcidin and other serum iron markers and their slope patterns or their combination are associated with infection in vulnerable patient populations.

      "# Title: Iron metabolism imbalance at the time of listing increases overall and infectious mortality after liver transplantation.\n# Abstract: Liver transplantation (LT) is the best treatment for patients with liver cancer or end stage cirrhosis, but it is still associated with a significant mortality. Therefore identifying factors associated with mortality could help improve patient management. The impact of iron metabolism, which could be a relevant therapeutic target, yield discrepant results in this setting. Previous studies suggest that increased serum ferritin is associated with higher mortality. Surprisingly iron deficiency which is a well described risk factor in critically ill patients has not been considered."

      "# Title: Safety of Same-Day Discharge Compared to Overnight Observation Following Laparoscopic Appendectomy in the Pediatric-Aged Patient: A National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Project.\n# Abstract: Background: Previous studies regarding same-day discharge (SDD) after laparoscopic appendectomy for pediatric patients have been limited by the cohort size and lack of specificity regarding the definition of SDD. Our study evaluates the safety of appendectomy performed with SDD in pediatric patients when compared to appendectomy followed by an overnight stay, using a large nationwide database and a strict definition of SDD by using hospital length of stay (LOS). Methods: Using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric (NSQIP-P) registry, we identified patients younger than 18 years of age who underwent outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy, with SDD (n = 2647) or overnight stay (n = 5045). One-to-one propensity score matching was performed to compare 30-day readmission rates and postsurgical complications. Results: Non-Hispanic black race was associated with a higher likelihood of overnight stay after laparoscopic appendectomy. In the propensity score-matched analysis (N = 2443 pairs), SDD was not associated with an increased risk of 30-day unplanned readmission (odds ratio [OR] = 0.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.6-1.4; P = .667) or any 30-day complication (OR = 0.8, 95% CI: 0.6-1.1; P = .258). Conclusion: SDD after laparoscopic appendectomy in pediatric patients was not associated with an increased risk of 30-day hospital admission or complication rate. Protocols to expedite perioperative care, including standardization of intraoperative care, may facilitate same-day hospital discharge, resulting in a decrease in health care costs.",

      "# Title: Prospective and randomized evaluation of ACL reconstruction with three techniques: a clinical and radiographic evaluation at 5 years follow-up.\n# Abstract: A variety of graft sources have been used for ACL reconstruction to improve functions and kinematics in ACL deficient knees. The two most commonly used autogenous grafts are the central third of the patellar tendon and the hamstring tendon constructs. The choice of different grafts and different construct influence the final clinical outcome of ACL reconstruction. The 3 groups, of 25 patients each, were generated by choosing the technique (PT tendon, 4 strand hamstring, and single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty) to utilize and followed for 5 years, with an alternate systematic sampling. Our comparison has shown significant kneeling pain in the patellar tendon with respect to the groups with hamstrings techniques. Single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty achieved subjective score significantly higher with respect to the other two groups as well as for the time to resume sport. The study confirms that patellar tendon and hamstring can be equivalent options for ACL reconstruction. This study demonstrated that a superior outcome as far as subjective clinical findings were concerned, was obtained in group III. Patients in the latter group were also able to return to sports sooner than those in the bone-patellar tendon graft group and the four-strand hamstring group.",

The purpose of this prospective randomized study was to compare the clinical, instrumental and X-ray outcome of two ACL reconstruction techniques with hamstring tendons: one with a single intra-articular bundle associated to an extra-articular sling, the second with a more anatomic double-bundle technique that reproduces better the native ACL function. From an initial group of 100 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction, 72 patients (35 single bundle plus lateral plasty and 37 double bundle) were evaluated with IKDC, Tegner score, KT2000 arthrometer, Activity Rating Scale, Psychovitality Questionnaire and Ahlback radiographic score at a mean 3 years follow-up. Double-bundle group showed significantly better results regarding IKDC, ROM, Activity Rating Scale and time to return to sport. Also KT 2000 showed significant differences in objective stability.

Assessment included Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee scores, objective examination and instrumented laxity test. Results: No complications were reported. Mean Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee scores significantly increased from preoperatively (p < 0.05). No differences were reported between the two groups with regard to point scales, anterior tibial translation and pivot-shift test (p = not significant). Conclusions: Both DB ACL reconstruction and combined LET and autologous hamstring SB ACL reconstruction are effective at providing satisfying functional outcomes and restoring rotational stability.",

Fifty patients who underwent ACLR with versus without ALLR were analyzed at four different time points (preoperatively and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively). For the functional outcomes, muscle strength and acceleration time (AT) were measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. Proprioception was evaluated using joint position sense and dynamic postural stability. Patient-reported outcomes were measured using the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK-11) scores. Functional performance was assessed using single-leg hop distance (SLHD) and Limb Symmetry Index. In the operated knees, quadriceps (at 6 months postoperatively, p = 0.003) and hamstring (at 6 and 12 months postoperatively, p < 0.001) strength were significantly higher in the combined ACLR and ALLR group than the isolated ACLR group. The TSK-11 (at 6 and 12 months postoperatively, p < 0.001) was significantly lower in the combined ACLR and ALLR group than the isolated ACLR group. SLHD was significantly higher in the combined ACLR and ALLR group than the isolated ACLR group (at 6 months, p = 0.022 and at 12 months, p = 0.024). The addition of ALLR to primary ACLR yielded better muscle performance, fear of movement, and functional performance than isolated ACLR."

A total of 80 patients with acute cerebral infarction who were treated at our hospital were randomly selected. They were divided into groups A and B. The two groups were treated with intravenous thrombolysis, while group B received sub-hypothermia treatment. Prior to treatment and at 7 days after treatment, 5 ml of venous blood was collected and stored in a freezer at -80˚C. IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 levels were detected by ELISA and compared between the groups and time-points. The results were as follows: i) At 7 days after treatment, the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in group B were significantly decreased compared with those in group A (P<0.05), while there was no significant difference of these levels between group A and B before treatment (P>0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions in group A and group B was 35 and 20% respectively, and the mortality rate was 10 and 5%, respectively. There were no significant differences in adverse events and mortality between the two groups (P>0.05). In addition, a positive correlation of the level of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was determined in the patients prior to treatment. In conclusion, mild hypothermia treatment in addition to intravenous thrombolysis significantly reduced the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in patients with acute cerebral infarction and reduced inflammation, and should therefore be incorporated in clinical practice.",

This study investigated the usefulness of LSM as a predictor of HCC development in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). A total of 1,130 patients with non-biopsy-proven CHB who underwent LSM between May 2005 and December 2007 were enrolled in this prospective study. After LSM was performed, patients attended regular follow-up as part of a surveillance program for the detection of HCC. The mean age of the patients (767 men, 363 women) was 50.2 years, and the median LSM was 7.7 kPa. Six hundred seventy-two (59.5%) patients received antiviral treatment before or after enrollment. During the follow-up period (median, 30.7 months; range, 24.0-50.9 months), HCC developed in 57 patients (2.0% per 1 person-year).

We investigated the efficacy of the ELF test in predicting development of liver-related events (LREs) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). A total of 170 patients (103 men; 60.6%) with CHB who underwent LB and serological tests for determining ELFs were enrolled. All patients were followed up to monitor LRE development, defined as hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and/or liver-related death. The mean age was 45.3 years. During the follow-up period (median, 41 months), 39 (22.9%) patients experienced LREs. In patients with LREs, age, proportion of male gender, ELF test results, age-spleen-platelet ratio (ASPRI), liver stiffness (LS) value, and proportion of histological cirrhosis were significantly higher than those in patients without LREs (all P < 0.05). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves to predict LRE development were 0.808 for the ELF test, 0.732 for LS value, 0.713 for histological fibrosis stages using Batts and Ludwig's scoring system, and 0.687 for ASPRI. On multivariate analysis, along with age, the ELF test was an independent predictor of LRE development (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.438; P < 0.001). When we applied a three-tier stratification of our study population using cut-off ELF values of 8.10 and 10.40, patients with low (P = 0.002; adjusted HR: 0.045; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.006-0.330) and intermediate (P < 0.001; adjusted HR: 0.239; 95% CI: 0.122-0.469) ELF range were found less likely to develop LREs, compared to those with high ELF range.",

This study investigated whether transient elastography (TE) can identify patients with subclinical cirrhosis (SCC) who are at increased risk of developing HCC among chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients without clinical evidence of cirrhosis. A total of 2,876 CHB patients without clinical cirrhosis who received TE examinations between April 2006 and December 2012 were enrolled in this prospective study. SCC was defined as a nonclinical cirrhosis, but with a liver stiffness (LS) value ≥13 kilopascals (kPa). Mean age of the study population was 46.1 years, and male gender was predominant (n = 1,775; 61.7%). Mean LS value was 7.9 kPa, and SCC was identified in 285 (9.9%) patients. During the median follow-up period of 48.9 months (range, 6.6-96.2), HCC developed in 16 patients (13.3 per 1,000 person-years) in the SCC group and 36 (3.4 per 1,000 person-years) in the non-SCC group. Cumulative incidence rate of HCC in the SCC group was significantly higher than that in the non-SCC group (P < 0.001, log-rank test).

A total of 9300 patients with CHB who underwent US and TE in two institutions between 2006 and 2018 were enrolled. TE value ≥13 kPa was set to indicate cirrhosis. Patients were divided into four groups: US(+)TE(+) (cirrhosis by US and TE), US(+)TE(-) (cirrhosis by US, but not by TE), US(-)TE(+) (cirrhosis by TE, but not by US) and US(-)TE(-) (non-cirrhosis by US and TE).The patients were predominantly male (n = 5474, 58.9%) with a mean age of 47.5 years. The proportions of patients with cirrhosis diagnosed by US and TE were 17.2% (n = 1595) and 13.2% (n = 1225), respectively. The proportion of patients with discordant results in diagnosing cirrhosis by US and TE was 18.7% (n = 1740).

    "referenceConclusion": "The evidence is robust for a strongly elevated risk of tuberculosis with radiological silicosis, with a low disease severity threshold. The effect estimate is more uncertain for silica exposure without radiological silicosis. Research is needed, particularly cohort studies measuring silica exposure in different settings, to characterise the effect more accurately as well as the silica exposure threshold that could be used to prevent excess tuberculosis risk. The study provides to our knowledge the first systematic review of the epidemiological evidence for an association identified at least a century ago, viz. that occupational inhalation of silica dust increases the risk of pulmonary tuberculosis in co-exposed populations. In the current era, even with less severe forms of silicosis in traditional dusty industries, the evidence remains strong for a substantially elevated risk of tuberculosis in those with radiologically diagnosed disease. While there is evidence for an elevated risk of tuberculosis in those who have not been radiologically diagnosed with silicosis, the effect size is subject to uncertainty. Further studies are needed to characterise this effect, and particularly the exposure threshold that would avoid an excess risk of tuberculosis.",

Two occupational categories were extracted--\"mining, tunneling, and quarrying\" (n = 284) and \"iron and steel foundries\" (n = 428), respectively. Control groups were drawn from a national register of persons undergoing periodic health examinations with regard to silicosis risk. The controls were matched for occupation, age, and time of first exposure. The follow-up was performed through record-linkage operations to computerized information in Swedish Death Statistics, Swedish Cancer Register, and the Swedish Tuberculosis Index. End of follow-up was set at December 31, 1980. In cases drawn from mining, quarrying, and tunneling workers seven deaths in lung cancer were observed and two among the controls. Among iron and steel foundry workers the corresponding numbers were 10 and 6. The values for expected numbers, based on general population statistics, were 1.3 and 2.6, respectively, for these two occupational groups. When cancer incidence statistics were used, the case/control ratio for lung cancer was 2.1 for \"mining, quarrying, and tunneling\" and 0.6 for \"iron and steel foundries.\" There were 29 cases of lung tuberculosis registered among the silicosis cases during the follow-up period. Only one tuberculosis case was observed among the controls. The results demonstrate that persons with silicosis contracted in the mining, quarrying, and tunneling occupations are subject to an increased risk of lung cancer. The risk is observed when both the general population and a closely matched control population from the same occupations are used for values of reference. The results also demonstrate the high risk of persons with silicosis to contract lung tuberculosis.",

In this study, a cohort of 1,153 older gold miners with and without silicosis who had not had tuberculosis have been followed for 7 yr by a routine mine surveillance program for detection of tuberculosis. One hundred seventy-eight of the men developed tuberculosis. The annual incidence of tuberculosis was 981/100,000 in the 335 men without silicosis and 2,707/100,000 in the 818 men with silicosis. The relative risk for tuberculosis was 2.8 (95% CI, 1.9 to 4.1) for men with silicosis compared with that in the men without silicosis. The incidence of tuberculosis increased from 1% per annum (pa) for the men without silicosis to 2.2% pa for the men with silicosis with Category 1 nodule profusion, 2.9% pa for those with Category 2, and 6.3% pa for those with Category 3 silicosis. This study has confirmed and quantified the high risk of pulmonary and of extrapulmonary tuberculosis in men with silicosis.

Risk factors for nontuberculous pulmonary mycobacterial (NTM) disease and tuberculosis (TB) in gold miners were identified in a retrospective case-control study that included 206 NTM patients and 381 TB patients of known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status diagnosed between 1993 and 1996. A total of 180 HIV-tested trauma/surgical inpatients were selected as control patients. Both HIV infection (odds ratio [OR] 3.6 for NTM and 4.5 for TB patients) and higher grades of silicosis (OR 5.0 for NTM and 4.9 for TB patients) were significantly more common in NTM and TB patients than in control patients. HIV prevalence rose in the control and both case groups during the study period. The overall HIV prevalence was 13.1% in NTM patients, 14.2% in TB patients, and 5.6% in control patients. Previous TB (OR 9.6), premorbid focal radiological scarring (OR 7.4) and a dusty job at diagnosis (OR 2.4) were additional significant risk factors for NTM disease. These findings suggest that the historically high incidence of NTM disease in miners is largely attributable to chronic chest disease from silica dust inhalation and prior TB. HIV infection has recently become an additional risk factor for mycobacterial disease in miners and is likely to become increasingly important as the HIV epidemic progresses.",

In addition, there is no reliable information on the MTB infection rate of patients undergoing different types of renal replacement therapy (RRT). We used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database to conduct a 9-year nationwide longitudinal study. Among 49 983 ESRD patients who received three renal replacement modalities, there were 562 cases of MTB infection, corresponding to an incidence rate of 3.0 per 1000 patient-years. The risk of MTB infection relative to the general population was 4.5. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the independent risk factors for MTB infection in ESRD patients are old age (hazard ratio (HR) 1.17 per 10 years, p <0.001), male gender (HR 1.37, p <0.001), silicosis (HR 5.82, p <0.001), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 1.68, p 0.012).

Our study evaluates the safety of appendectomy performed with SDD in pediatric patients when compared to appendectomy followed by an overnight stay, using a large nationwide database and a strict definition of SDD by using hospital length of stay (LOS). Methods: Using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric (NSQIP-P) registry, we identified patients younger than 18 years of age who underwent outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy, with SDD (n = 2647) or overnight stay (n = 5045). One-to-one propensity score matching was performed to compare 30-day readmission rates and postsurgical complications. Results: Non-Hispanic black race was associated with a higher likelihood of overnight stay after laparoscopic appendectomy. In the propensity score-matched analysis (N = 2443 pairs), SDD was not associated with an increased risk of 30-day unplanned readmission (odds ratio [OR] = 0.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.6-1.4; P = .667) or any 30-day complication (OR = 0.8, 95% CI: 0.6-1.1; P = .258). Conclusion: SDD after laparoscopic appendectomy in pediatric patients was not associated with an increased risk of 30-day hospital admission or complication rate.

Our objective was to determine if mFI predicts morbidity and mortality in the diverse national cohort of patients undergoing neurosurgery for intracranial neoplasms. We identified patients in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program who underwent oncologic neurosurgery procedures between 2008 and 2012. The mFI, ranging from 0 to 1, was calculated as the proportion of 11 possible risk factors present. We assessed the associations between mFI and 30-day mortality, neurologic and medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge in univariate and multivariable analyses and compare the index to established risk stratification techniques. A total of 9149 patients were identified. Mortality, severe medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge increased incrementally with increasing levels of frailty. Severe neurologic complications were highest in those with low frailty. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, increased frailty increased the odds of all adverse outcomes, including neurologic complications. The mFI increased the ability to predict all outcomes beyond available indices and was the most reliable predictor of neurologic complications. The mFI can be calculated from routinely collected medical record data and is predictive of 30-day adverse outcomes in a wide variety of neurosurgical oncology patients. The index may be a useful component of preoperative risk assessment with implications for shared decision-making, perioperative planning, and risk adjusted outcomes measurement in national quality registries.",

Few data exist regarding the relationship of frailty with adverse outcomes in craniotomy for brain tumor resection. We assessed the relationship between frailty and the incidence of major post-operative complication, discharge destination other than home, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality after elective craniotomy for brain tumor resection. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 20,333 adult patients undergoing elective craniotomy for tumor resection in the 2012-2018 ACS-NSQIP Participant Use File. Multivariate logistic regression was performed using all covariates deemed eligible through clinical and statistical significance. 6,249 patients (30.7%) were low-frailty and 2,148 patients (10.6%) were medium-to-high frailty. In multivariate logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, BMI, ASA classification, smoking status, dyspnea, significant pre-operative weight loss, chronic steroid use, bleeding disorder, tumor type, and operative time, low frailty was associated with increased adjusted odds ratio of major complication (1.41, 95% CI: 1.23-1.60, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.32, 95% CI: 1.20-1.46, p < 0.001), 30-day readmission (1.29, 95% CI: 1.15-1.44, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (1.87, 95% CI: 1.41-2.47, p < 0.001). Moderate-to-high frailty was also associated with increased adjusted odds of major complication (1.61, 95% CI: 1.35-1.92, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.80, 95% CI: 1.58-2.05), 30-day readmission (1.39, 95% CI: 1.19-1.62, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (2.42, 95% CI: 1.74-3.38, p < 0.001).

A total of 80 patients with acute cerebral infarction who were treated at our hospital were randomly selected. They were divided into groups A and B. The two groups were treated with intravenous thrombolysis, while group B received sub-hypothermia treatment. Prior to treatment and at 7 days after treatment, 5 ml of venous blood was collected and stored in a freezer at -80˚C. IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 levels were detected by ELISA and compared between the groups and time-points. The results were as follows: i) At 7 days after treatment, the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in group B were significantly decreased compared with those in group A (P<0.05), while there was no significant difference of these levels between group A and B before treatment (P>0.05).

      "# Title: Use of over-the-scope clips (OTSC) for hemostasis in gastrointestinal bleeding in patients under antithrombotic therapy.\n# Abstract: Background and study aims In patients taking different regimens of antithrombotic and/or anticoagulant therapy, endoscopic management of gastrointestinal bleeding represents a major challenge due to failing endogenous hemostasis. In this retrospective study we report on success rates with the over-the-scope clip (OTSC) system in upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding in this high-risk patient population. Patients and methods Between February 2011 and June 2014, 75 patients were treated with an OTSC for active gastrointestinal bleeding. Success rates with the first endoscopic therapy, rebleeding episodes, their management and the influence of antithrombotic or anticoagulant therapy were analyzed retrospectively. Results Application of the OTSC resulted in immediate hemostasis (primary success rate) in all 75 patients. However, in 34.7 % a rebleeding episode was noted that could be treated by further endoscopic interventions. Only 3 patients had to be sent to the operating room because of failure of endoscopic therapy. In the rebleeding group the use of antiplatelet therapies was higher (73.1 % vs. 48.9 %). Conclusions Application of the OTSC in GI bleeding results in a high rate of primary hemostasis. Rebleeding occurs in up to 35 % of patients receiving antithrombotic/anticoagulant therapy but can be managed successfully with further endoscopic treatments. Patients in the rebleeding group were more frequently treated with antiplatelet agents. Radiological or surgical therapy was reserved for a small subgroup not successfully managed by repeated endoscopic therapies. OTSC application is the treatment of choice in high-risk patients when conventional clips used as first-line treatment fail.",

The over-the-scope clip (OTSC) may overcome limitations of standard clips or thermocoagulation in high-risk bleeding lesions. We evaluate the main clinically relevant outcomes following endoscopic hemostasis with OTSC in high-risk lesions and/or patients. Patients and methods  This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected databases including all patients with UGIB and LGIB who underwent OTCS placement as first-line treatment in eleven tertiary endoscopic referral centers. Technical success, primary hemostasis, rebleeding, blood transfusion, hospital stay, and hemorrhage-related mortality rates were evaluated. Results  Data from 286 patients, with either UGIB (N = 214) or LGIB (N = 72) were available. Overall, 112 patients (39.2 %) were receiving antithrombotic therapy. Technical success and primary hemostasis rates were 97.9 % and 96.4 %, respectively. Early rebleeding occurred in 4.4 %, more frequently in those on antithrombotic therapy, and no late rebleeding was observed. Following a successful primary haemostasis, only 5.2 % patients needed blood transfusions, and the median hospital stay was 4 days (range: 3 - 11). Eighteen patients with either technical failure (N = 6) or rebleeding (N = 12) underwent radiological or surgical approaches. Overall, bleeding-related deaths occurred in 5 (1.7 %) patients, including 3 patients with technical procedural failure, and 2 in the rebleeding group.  Conclusions  Data from our large, multicenter study show that OTSC placement is an effective first-line treatment for hemostasis in high-risk patients and/or lesions both in upper and lower gastrointestinal tract.",

Patients and methods  Data on endoscopic treatment (first- vs. second-line) in PUB with OTSC and clinical data were analyzed. The primary outcome was the clinical success of hemostasis, defined as the absence of recurrent bleeding or further intervention. Secondary outcomes were factors associated with OTSC failure. Results  From April 2014 to March 2018, 100 patients (age 72 [20 - 98] y, female 36 %) with PUB in the stomach or the duodenum were treated endoscopically with the OTSC. The OTSC was used as a first-line procedure (primary-OTSC) in 66 pts. Successful hemostasis could be achieved in 90.9 %. After failure of an initial endoscopic treatment, 34 patients were treated with the OTSC (secondary-OTSC) and the treatment was successful in 94.1 %. Recurrent bleeding occurred in n = 10 for primary-OTSC (16.7 %) and in n = 7 pts in the secondary-OTSC (21.9 %) ( P  = 0.81). Clinical success in the primary-OTSC was 75.8 % and 73.5 % in the secondary-OTSC respectively. Conclusions  The OTSC has a high rate of initial bleeding control in first- and second line treatment of PUB. OTSC failure occurs more often in the duodenum than in the stomach and results in longer intensive care unit stay, higher amount of transfusions, and a higher reimbursement per case."

    "referenceConclusion": "The evidence is robust for a strongly elevated risk of tuberculosis with radiological silicosis, with a low disease severity threshold. The effect estimate is more uncertain for silica exposure without radiological silicosis. Research is needed, particularly cohort studies measuring silica exposure in different settings, to characterise the effect more accurately as well as the silica exposure threshold that could be used to prevent excess tuberculosis risk. The study provides to our knowledge the first systematic review of the epidemiological evidence for an association identified at least a century ago, viz. that occupational inhalation of silica dust increases the risk of pulmonary tuberculosis in co-exposed populations. In the current era, even with less severe forms of silicosis in traditional dusty industries, the evidence remains strong for a substantially elevated risk of tuberculosis in those with radiologically diagnosed disease. While there is evidence for an elevated risk of tuberculosis in those who have not been radiologically diagnosed with silicosis, the effect size is subject to uncertainty. Further studies are needed to characterise this effect, and particularly the exposure threshold that would avoid an excess risk of tuberculosis.",

For the 18-year follow-up period, the following groups had statistically significant increased standard incidence rates (SIR) for pulmonary tuberculosis: silicotics, SIR = 1000 (95% CI = 272 to 2561, P less than .01); nonsilicotics employed at least 25 years, SIR = 353 (95% CI = 130 to 768, P less than .01); and for the entire cohort, SIR = 201 (95% CI = 125 to 397, P = .01).

Two occupational categories were extracted--\"mining, tunneling, and quarrying\" (n = 284) and \"iron and steel foundries\" (n = 428), respectively. Control groups were drawn from a national register of persons undergoing periodic health examinations with regard to silicosis risk. The controls were matched for occupation, age, and time of first exposure. The follow-up was performed through record-linkage operations to computerized information in Swedish Death Statistics, Swedish Cancer Register, and the Swedish Tuberculosis Index. End of follow-up was set at December 31, 1980. In cases drawn from mining, quarrying, and tunneling workers seven deaths in lung cancer were observed and two among the controls. Among iron and steel foundry workers the corresponding numbers were 10 and 6. The values for expected numbers, based on general population statistics, were 1.3 and 2.6, respectively, for these two occupational groups. When cancer incidence statistics were used, the case/control ratio for lung cancer was 2.1 for \"mining, quarrying, and tunneling\" and 0.6 for \"iron and steel foundries.\" There were 29 cases of lung tuberculosis registered among the silicosis cases during the follow-up period. Only one tuberculosis case was observed among the controls. The results demonstrate that persons with silicosis contracted in the mining, quarrying, and tunneling occupations are subject to an increased risk of lung cancer. The risk is observed when both the general population and a closely matched control population from the same occupations are used for values of reference. The results also demonstrate the high risk of persons with silicosis to contract lung tuberculosis.",

In this study, a cohort of 1,153 older gold miners with and without silicosis who had not had tuberculosis have been followed for 7 yr by a routine mine surveillance program for detection of tuberculosis. One hundred seventy-eight of the men developed tuberculosis. The annual incidence of tuberculosis was 981/100,000 in the 335 men without silicosis and 2,707/100,000 in the 818 men with silicosis. The relative risk for tuberculosis was 2.8 (95% CI, 1.9 to 4.1) for men with silicosis compared with that in the men without silicosis. The incidence of tuberculosis increased from 1% per annum (pa) for the men without silicosis to 2.2% pa for the men with silicosis with Category 1 nodule profusion, 2.9% pa for those with Category 2, and 6.3% pa for those with Category 3 silicosis. This study has confirmed and quantified the high risk of pulmonary and of extrapulmonary tuberculosis in men with silicosis. The incidence of tuberculosis during this 7-yr study suggests that one quarter of these men with silicosis will have developed tuberculosis by 60 yr of age.",

      "# Title: Risk factors for pulmonary mycobacterial disease in South African gold miners. A case-control study.\n# Abstract: Pulmonary mycobacterial disease is common in miners. Risk factors for nontuberculous pulmonary mycobacterial (NTM) disease and tuberculosis (TB) in gold miners were identified in a retrospective case-control study that included 206 NTM patients and 381 TB patients of known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status diagnosed between 1993 and 1996. A total of 180 HIV-tested trauma/surgical inpatients were selected as control patients. Both HIV infection (odds ratio [OR] 3.6 for NTM and 4.5 for TB patients) and higher grades of silicosis (OR 5.0 for NTM and 4.9 for TB patients) were significantly more common in NTM and TB patients than in control patients. HIV prevalence rose in the control and both case groups during the study period. The overall HIV prevalence was 13.1% in NTM patients, 14.2% in TB patients, and 5.6% in control patients. Previous TB (OR 9.6), premorbid focal radiological scarring (OR 7.4) and a dusty job at diagnosis (OR 2.4) were additional significant risk factors for NTM disease. These findings suggest that the historically high incidence of NTM disease in miners is largely attributable to chronic chest disease from silica dust inhalation and prior TB. HIV infection has recently become an additional risk factor for mycobacterial disease in miners and is likely to become increasingly important as the HIV epidemic progresses.",

In addition, there is no reliable information on the MTB infection rate of patients undergoing different types of renal replacement therapy (RRT). We used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database to conduct a 9-year nationwide longitudinal study. Among 49 983 ESRD patients who received three renal replacement modalities, there were 562 cases of MTB infection, corresponding to an incidence rate of 3.0 per 1000 patient-years. The risk of MTB infection relative to the general population was 4.5. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the independent risk factors for MTB infection in ESRD patients are old age (hazard ratio (HR) 1.17 per 10 years, p <0.001), male gender (HR 1.37, p <0.001), silicosis (HR 5.82, p <0.001), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 1.68, p 0.012).

The aim of this study was to compare clinical outcome in liver transplant patients with and without iron overload. We also sought to determine the prevalence of HFE mutations in liver transplant patients with iron overload. Of 456 consecutive liver transplants, 41 explants had an hepatic iron index (HII) greater than 1.9, and these cases were compared to 41 matched liver transplant recipients without increased hepatic iron. Posttransplantation complications, along with patient and graft survival were monitored. HFE gene testing was performed using DNA-based techniques. Kaplan-Meier 5-year patient survival after LTx was significantly lower in cases with hepatic iron overload compared to matched controls without iron excess (48% vs. 77%; P =.045). Fatal infections (especially fungal) were more common in patients with iron overload (24% vs. 7%; P =.03). Of the 41 patients with a liver explant HII greater than 1.9, only 4 were C282Y homozygotes. Patients with severe hepatic explant iron overload undergoing LTx have a reduced survival compared to liver transplant recipients without explant iron excess. The reduced survival was attributable mainly to fatal bacterial and fungal infections. Despite the iron overload, HFE gene mutations were uncommon in patients with hepatic explant hemosiderosis.",
      "# Title: Association of hepatic iron overload with invasive fungal infection in liver transplant recipients.\n# Abstract: Invasive fungal infection is a serious complication of orthotopic liver transplantation, but its risk factors remain incompletely defined. Iron overload has already been associated with increased risk of fungal infections, but it has not yet been assessed as a risk factor in liver transplantation. We retrospectively studied a cohort of 153 consecutive patients who underwent their first liver transplantation at a single center and who survived at least 7 days after transplantation. The association between various pretransplant patient characteristics, including hepatic explant iron and risk of invasive fungal infections, was analyzed by univariate and multivariate models. Iron in the hepatic explant was assessed by Perl's Prussian blue stain by a pathologist blinded to clinical outcome. During the first year after transplantation, 28 of 153 patients developed a total of 31 invasive fungal infections, of which 21 (68%) were caused by Candida, 7 (23%) by Aspergillus, 2 (6%) by Cryptococcus, and 1 (3%) by Saccharomyces. Stainable iron in the hepatic explant was found in 48 patients (31%). Stainable iron in the hepatic explant was found to be strongly and independently associated with posttransplantation fungal infections in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 3.09; 95% confidence interval 1.45-6.56; P = 0.003). Hepatic iron overload is strongly and independently associated with posttransplantation invasive fungal infections. Studies to confirm this finding in other centers and define the mechanism are warranted.",
      "# Title: Serum ferritin concentration predicts mortality in patients awaiting liver transplantation.\n# Abstract: Additional markers are required to identify patients on the orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) waiting list at increased risk of death and adverse clinical events. Serum ferritin concentration is a marker of varied pathophysiological events and is elevated with increased liver iron concentration, hepatic necroinflammation, and systemic illness, all of which may cause a deterioration in liver function and clinical status. The aim of this study was to determine whether serum ferritin concentration is an independent prognostic factor in subjects awaiting OLT. This is a dual-center retrospective study. The study cohort consisted of 191 consecutive adults with cirrhosis accepted by the Queensland (Australia) Liver Transplant Service between January 2000 and June 2006 and a validation cohort of 131 patients from University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Transplant Center. In the study cohort, baseline serum ferritin greater than 200 microg/L was an independent factor predicting increased 180-day and 1-year waiting list mortality. This effect was independent of model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), hepatocellular carcinoma, age, and sex. Subjects with higher serum ferritin had increased frequency of liver-related clinical events. The relationship between serum ferritin and waiting list mortality was confirmed in the UCLA cohort; all deceased patients had serum ferritin greater than 400 microg/L. Serum ferritin greater than 500 microg/L and MELD were independent risk factors for death.",

      "# Title: Serum ferritin concentration and transferrin saturation before liver transplantation predict decreased long-term recipient survival.\n# Abstract: Serum ferritin (SF) concentration is a widely available parameter used to assess iron homeostasis. It has been described as a marker to identify high-risk patients awaiting liver transplantation (LT) but is also elevated in systemic immune-mediated diseases, metabolic syndrome, and in hemodialysis where it is associated with an inferior prognosis. This study analyzed whether SF is not only a predictor of liver-related mortality prior to LT but also an independent marker of survival following LT. In a dual-center, retrospective study, a cohort of 328 consecutive first-LT patients from Hannover Medical School, Germany (2003-2008, follow-up 1260 days), and 82 consecutive LT patients from Regensburg University Hospital, Germany (2003-2007, follow-up 1355 days) as validation cohort were analyzed. In patients exhibiting SF ≥365 μg/L versus <365 μg/L prior to LT, 1-, 3-, and 5-year post-LT survival was 73.3% versus 81.1%, 64.4% versus 77.3%, and 61.1% versus 74.4%, respectively (overall survival P = 0.0097), which was confirmed in the validation cohort (overall survival of 55% versus 83.3%, P = 0.005). Multivariate analyses identified SF ≥365 μg/L combined with transferrin saturation (TFS) <55%, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the survival after LT (SALT) score as independent risk factors for death. In patients with SF concentrations ≥365 μg/L and TFS <55%, overall survival was 54% versus 74.8% in the remaining group (P = 0.003). In the validation cohort, it was 28.6% versus 72% (P = 0.017), respectively.",
      "# Title: The association of pretransplant ferritin level with waiting list and post-transplant survival. Does ferritin actually predict outcome?\n# Abstract: Recent data suggest an association of serum ferritin (SF) with waiting list (WL) and postliver transplant (LT) outcomes. To assess the predictive capacity of SF on pre- and post-LT outcomes, and to identify whether recipient or donor liver siderosis is associated with post-LT survival; a retrospective analysis of 1079 patients assessed for first LT, 2000-2007 was performed. Iron deposition in the liver tissue was assessed using a semi-quantitative grading system. Median age was 54 (18-82) years and 67% were male. Seventeen per cent had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Median Model for End-stage Liver Disease MELD score was 14 (6-40), ferritin was 174 μg/l (4-4597) with 36.5% had a SF ≥ μg/l. Age (OR = 1.028) and MELD score (OR = 1.158) were independently associated with WL mortality (P < 0.001), whilst SF was not (P = NS). Age (OR = 1.018), HCC (OR = 1.542) and cold ischemia time (CIT) ≥ 10 h (OR = 1.418) were independently associated with post-LT survival (P < 0.05). Explant siderosis grade <2 was seen in 376 (71.7%) patients. Patients with explant siderosis grade ≥ 2 had inferior 12-month post-LT survival (P = 0.030). Presence of graft siderosis (15.8% of patients) was not associated with survival. In conclusion, we found a limited role for SF as a prognostic indicator for pre- or post-transplant survival.",
      "# Title: Iron-related markers are associated with infection after liver transplantation.\n# Abstract: Though serum iron has been known to be associated with an increased risk of infection, hepcidin, the major regulator of iron metabolism, has never been systematically explored in this setting. Finding early biomarkers of infection, such as hepcidin, could help identify patients in whom early empiric antimicrobial therapy would be beneficial. We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients (n = 128) undergoing first-time, single-organ orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) without known iron overload disorders at 2 academic hospitals in Boston from August 2009 to November 2012. Cox regression compared the associations between different iron markers and the development of first infection at least 1 week after OLT; 47 (37%) patients developed a primary outcome of infection at least 1 week after OLT and 1 patient died. After adjusting for perioperative bleeding complications, number of hospital days, and hepatic artery thrombosis, changes in iron markers were associated with the development of infection post-OLT including increasing ferritin (hazard ratio [HR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-2.05), rising ferritin slope (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.17), and increasing hepcidin (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.05-1.93). A decreasing iron (HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.20-2.57) and a decreasing iron slope (HR, 4.21; 95% CI, 2.51-7.06) were also associated with subsequent infections. In conclusion, hepcidin and other serum iron markers and their slope patterns or their combination are associated with infection in vulnerable patient populations.

      "# Title: Iron metabolism imbalance at the time of listing increases overall and infectious mortality after liver transplantation.\n# Abstract: Liver transplantation (LT) is the best treatment for patients with liver cancer or end stage cirrhosis, but it is still associated with a significant mortality. Therefore identifying factors associated with mortality could help improve patient management. The impact of iron metabolism, which could be a relevant therapeutic target, yield discrepant results in this setting. Previous studies suggest that increased serum ferritin is associated with higher mortality. Surprisingly iron deficiency which is a well described risk factor in critically ill patients has not been considered."

      "# Title: The modified frailty index and 30-day adverse events in oncologic neurosurgery.\n# Abstract: The modified frailty index (mFI) is emerging as a leading measure for preoperative risk assessment using routinely available medical record data. Our objective was to determine if mFI predicts morbidity and mortality in the diverse national cohort of patients undergoing neurosurgery for intracranial neoplasms. We identified patients in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program who underwent oncologic neurosurgery procedures between 2008 and 2012. The mFI, ranging from 0 to 1, was calculated as the proportion of 11 possible risk factors present. We assessed the associations between mFI and 30-day mortality, neurologic and medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge in univariate and multivariable analyses and compare the index to established risk stratification techniques. A total of 9149 patients were identified. Mortality, severe medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge increased incrementally with increasing levels of frailty. Severe neurologic complications were highest in those with low frailty. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, increased frailty increased the odds of all adverse outcomes, including neurologic complications. The mFI increased the ability to predict all outcomes beyond available indices and was the most reliable predictor of neurologic complications. The mFI can be calculated from routinely collected medical record data and is predictive of 30-day adverse outcomes in a wide variety of neurosurgical oncology patients. The index may be a useful component of preoperative risk assessment with implications for shared decision-making, perioperative planning, and risk adjusted outcomes measurement in national quality registries.",

When assessing quality of life for patients with brain tumors, having a better predictor of postsurgical outcome would be beneficial in counseling these patients. Frailty is thought to estimate physiologic reserves, and it has been found to predict postoperative complications, length of stay, and discharge to a skilled nursing facility or assisted living facility in patients undergoing various types of surgery. Frailty as an adjunct to preoperative assessment of neurosurgical patients has never been evaluated.

      "# Title: Frailty and outcomes after craniotomy for brain tumor.\n# Abstract: Frailty has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in a variety of surgical disciplines. Few data exist regarding the relationship of frailty with adverse outcomes in craniotomy for brain tumor resection. We assessed the relationship between frailty and the incidence of major post-operative complication, discharge destination other than home, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality after elective craniotomy for brain tumor resection. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 20,333 adult patients undergoing elective craniotomy for tumor resection in the 2012-2018 ACS-NSQIP Participant Use File. Multivariate logistic regression was performed using all covariates deemed eligible through clinical and statistical significance. 6,249 patients (30.7%) were low-frailty and 2,148 patients (10.6%) were medium-to-high frailty. In multivariate logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, BMI, ASA classification, smoking status, dyspnea, significant pre-operative weight loss, chronic steroid use, bleeding disorder, tumor type, and operative time, low frailty was associated with increased adjusted odds ratio of major complication (1.41, 95% CI: 1.23-1.60, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.32, 95% CI: 1.20-1.46, p < 0.001), 30-day readmission (1.29, 95% CI: 1.15-1.44, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (1.87, 95% CI: 1.41-2.47, p < 0.001). Moderate-to-high frailty was also associated with increased adjusted odds of major complication (1.61, 95% CI: 1.35-1.92, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.80, 95% CI: 1.58-2.05), 30-day readmission (1.39, 95% CI: 1.19-1.62, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (2.42, 95% CI: 1.74-3.38, p < 0.001).

The results were as follows: i) At 7 days after treatment, the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in group B were significantly decreased compared with those in group A (P<0.05), while there was no significant difference of these levels between group A and B before treatment (P>0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions in group A and group B was 35 and 20% respectively, and the mortality rate was 10 and 5%, respectively. There were no significant differences in adverse events and mortality between the two groups (P>0.05). In addition, a positive correlation of the level of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was determined in the patients prior to treatment. In conclusion, mild hypothermia treatment in addition to intravenous thrombolysis significantly reduced the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in patients with acute cerebral infarction and reduced inflammation, and should therefore be incorporated in clinical practice.",

    "referenceConclusion": "High PM 2.5 exposure is one of the most important avoidable hazards to human health. The effects on hematological systems have been less well-studied. There were fewer than 20 available entries in the web search according to the Cochrane recommendation as the damages are not easily analyzed and are mostly unnoticed. All available studies found harmful effects of long-term exposure to PM 2.5 to the hematopoietic system. Hematological parameter changes in people exposed to medium to high PM 2.5 concentrations for more than a year are summarized in Table 2 . The pathophysiology of PM 2.5 pollution may be from increased inflammatory responses affecting each hematological component. For the public, avoidance of exposure and reduction in PM 2.5 pollution should be encouraged. Interventions should be focused on the high-risk groups including the elderly with cardiovascular diseases, young children, and pregnant women. Personal facemasks can minimize inhaled small particles and reduce pollution exposure time. Air purifiers also lessen indoor pollution concentrations. Improving air quality has to be addressed for the general population. Decreasing PM 2.5 pollution is essential to prevent hematological adverse events. Further studies are needed to determine whether reducing PM 2.5 exposure can decrease these disorders. Pathophysiology of PM 2.5 effects on individual hematologic parameters and the high-risk groups. High PM 2.5 : A 24-h mean level between 25 and 50 μg/m 3 or annual mean over 10 μg/m 3 . Very high PM 2.5 : A 24-h mean level over 50 μg/m 3 .",

      "# Title: Particulate matter air pollution and cardiovascular disease: An update to the scientific statement from the American Heart Association.\n# Abstract: In 2004, the first American Heart Association scientific statement on \"Air Pollution and Cardiovascular Disease\" concluded that exposure to particulate matter (PM) air pollution contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In the interim, numerous studies have expanded our understanding of this association and further elucidated the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved. The main objective of this updated American Heart Association scientific statement is to provide a comprehensive review of the new evidence linking PM exposure with cardiovascular disease, with a specific focus on highlighting the clinical implications for researchers and healthcare providers. The writing group also sought to provide expert consensus opinions on many aspects of the current state of science and updated suggestions for areas of future research. On the basis of the findings of this review, several new conclusions were reached, including the following: Exposure to PM <2.5 microm in diameter (PM(2.5)) over a few hours to weeks can trigger cardiovascular disease-related mortality and nonfatal events; longer-term exposure (eg, a few years) increases the risk for cardiovascular mortality to an even greater extent than exposures over a few days and reduces life expectancy within more highly exposed segments of the population by several months to a few years; reductions in PM levels are associated with decreases in cardiovascular mortality within a time frame as short as a few years; and many credible pathological mechanisms have been elucidated that lend biological plausibility to these findings. It is the opinion of the writing group that the overall evidence is consistent with a causal relationship between PM(2.5) exposure and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This body of evidence has grown and been strengthened substantially since the first American Heart Association scientific statement was published. Finally, PM(2.5) exposure is deemed a modifiable factor that contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.",

      "# Title: Effects of particulate matter exposure on blood 5-hydroxymethylation: results from the Beijing truck driver air pollution study.\n# Abstract: Previous studies have reported epigenetic changes induced by environmental exposures. However, previous investigations did not distinguish 5-methylcytosine (5mC) from a similar oxidative form with opposite functions, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Here, we measured blood DNA global 5mC and 5hmC by ELISA and used adjusted mixed-effects regression models to evaluate the effects of ambient PM10 and personal PM2.5 and its elemental components-black carbon (BC), aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), iron (Fe), sulfur (S), silicon (Si), titanium (Ti), and zinc (Zn)-on blood global 5mC and 5hmC levels. The study was conducted in 60 truck drivers and 60 office workers in Beijing, China from The Beijing Truck Driver Air Pollution Study at 2 exams separated by one to 2 weeks. Blood 5hmC level (0.08%) was ∼83-fold lower than 5mC (6.61%). An inter-quartile range (IQR) increase in same-day PM10 was associated with increases in 5hmC of 26.1% in office workers (P = 0.004), 20.2% in truck drivers (P = 0.014), and 21.9% in all participants combined (P < 0.001). PM10 effects on 5hmC were increasingly stronger when averaged over 4, 7, and 14 d preceding assessment (up to 132.6% for the 14-d average in all participants, P < 0.001). PM10 effects were also significant after controlling for multiple testing (family-wise error rate; FWER < 0.05). 5hmC was not correlated with personal measures of PM2.5 and elemental components (FWER > 0.05). 5mC showed no correlations with PM10, PM2.5, and elemental components measures (FWER > 0.05). Our study suggests that exposure to ambient PM10 affects 5hmC over time, but not 5mC. This finding demonstrates the need to differentiate 5hmC and 5mC in environmental studies of DNA methylation.",
      "# Title: Environmental nanoparticles are significantly over-expressed in acute myeloid leukemia.\n# Abstract: The increase in the incidence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) may suggest a possible environmental etiology. PM2.5 was declared by IARC a Class I carcinogen. No report has focused on particulate environmental pollution together with AML. The study investigated the presence and composition of particulate matter in blood with a Scanning Electron Microscope coupled with an Energy Dispersive Spectroscope, a sensor capable of identifying the composition of foreign bodies. 38 peripheral blood samples, 19 AML cases and 19 healthy controls, were analyzed. A significant overload of particulate matter-derived nanoparticles linked or aggregated to blood components was found in AML patients, while almost absent in matched healthy controls. Two-tailed Student's t-test, MANOVA and Principal Component Analysis indicated that the total numbers of aggregates and particles were statistically different between cases and controls (MANOVA, P<0.001 and P=0.009 respectively). The particles detected showed to contain highly-reactive, non-biocompatible and non-biodegradable metals; in particular, micro- and nano-sized particles grouped in organic/inorganic clusters, with statistically higher frequency of a subgroup of elements in AML samples. The demonstration, for the first time, of an overload of nanoparticles linked to blood components in AML patients could be the basis for a possible, novel pathogenetic mechanism for AML development.",

      "# Title: Increased Outdoor PM2.5 Concentration Is Associated with Moderate/Severe Anemia in Children Aged 6-59 Months in Lima, Peru.\n# Abstract: Anemia affects 1.62 billion people worldwide. Although iron deficiency is the main cause of anemia, several other factors may explain its high prevalence. In this study, we sought to analyze the association between outdoor particulate matter PM2.5 levels with anemia prevalence in children aged 6-59 months residing in Lima, Peru (n = 139,368), one of the cities with the worst air pollution in Latin America. The study period was from 2012 to 2016. Anemia was defined according to the World Health Organization (Hb < 11 g/dL). PM2.5 values were estimated by a mathematical model that combined data observed from monitors, with satellite and meteorological data. PM2.5 was analyzed by quintiles. Multiple linear and logistic regressions were used to estimate the associations between hemoglobin concentration (beta) and anemia (odds ratio) with PM2.5, after adjusting by covariates. Prevalence of anemia was 39.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 39.3-39.9). Mild anemia was observed in 30.8% of children and moderate/severe in 8.84% of children. Anemic children compared with nonanemic children are mainly males, have low body weight, higher rate of stunting, and live in an environment with high PM2.5 concentration. A slight decrease in hemoglobin (4Q B: -0.03, 95% CI: -0.05 to -0.02; 5Q B: -0.04, 95% CI: -0.06 to -0.01) and an increase in the probability of moderate/severe anemia (4Q OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.10-1.27; 5Q OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.08-1.29) were observed with increased exposure to PM2.5. We conclude that outdoor PM2.5 levels were significantly associated with decreased hemoglobin values and an increase in prevalence of moderate/severe anemia in children under 5 years old.",

      "# Title: Residential Exposure to PM2.5 Components and Risk of Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in Denmark: A Nationwide Register-Based Case-Control Study.\n# Abstract: In a recent study, we observed an increased risk of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) associated with exposure to fine atmospheric particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon (BC). In this nationwide register-based case-control study, we focus on specific components of PM2.5 in relation to childhood NHL in Denmark (1981-2013) by identifying all incidents of childhood NHL cases in the Danish Cancer Registry (n = 170) and four (cancer-free) randomly selected controls matched by date of birth and sex. We applied PM2.5 concentrations and the following sub-components: secondary organic aerosols (SOA), secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA; i.e., NO3-, NH4+ and SO42-), BC, organic carbon (OC) and sea salt. We calculated a time-weighted exposure average from birth to index-date at all addresses. Odds ratios (ORs) were adjusted for register-based socio-demographic variables. We observed adjusted ORs and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of 2.05 (1.10, 3.83) per interquartile range (IQR, 4.83 µg/m3) PM2.5 and 1.73 (0.68, 4.41) per IQR (3.71 µg/m3) SIA, 0.95 (0.71, 1.29) per IQR (0.05 µg/m3) SOA, 1.22 (1.02, 1.46) per IQR (0.39 µg/m3) BC, 1.02 (0.83, 1.26) per IQR (0.56 µg/m3) OC and 1.01 (0.79, 1.30) per IQR (0.87 µg/m3) sea salt, respectively. The estimates were attenuated after adjustment for PM2.5, whereas the OR for PM2.5 remained increased regardless of adjustment for specific components. The findings indicate that the previously observed relation between PM2.5 and childhood NHL may be related to BC (as reported in our previous study) but also partly to SIA, but the role of specific chemical components of PM2.5 remains ambiguous."

The two most commonly used autogenous grafts are the central third of the patellar tendon and the hamstring tendon constructs. The choice of different grafts and different construct influence the final clinical outcome of ACL reconstruction. The 3 groups, of 25 patients each, were generated by choosing the technique (PT tendon, 4 strand hamstring, and single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty) to utilize and followed for 5 years, with an alternate systematic sampling. Our comparison has shown significant kneeling pain in the patellar tendon with respect to the groups with hamstrings techniques. Single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty achieved subjective score significantly higher with respect to the other two groups as well as for the time to resume sport. The study confirms that patellar tendon and hamstring can be equivalent options for ACL reconstruction. This study demonstrated that a superior outcome as far as subjective clinical findings were concerned, was obtained in group III. Patients in the latter group were also able to return to sports sooner than those in the bone-patellar tendon graft group and the four-strand hamstring group.",

The purpose of this prospective randomized study was to compare the clinical, instrumental and X-ray outcome of two ACL reconstruction techniques with hamstring tendons: one with a single intra-articular bundle associated to an extra-articular sling, the second with a more anatomic double-bundle technique that reproduces better the native ACL function.

      "# Title: A medium to long-term follow-up of ACL reconstruction using double gracilis and semitendinosus grafts.\n# Abstract: This paper reports the results of our approach to ACL tears and knee laxity, based on 30 years of experience in ACL reconstruction with hamstrings and founded on the following cornerstones: the use of doubled semitendinosus and gracilis as a free graft; the use of an out-in technique for femoral drilling and of very strong and stiff fixation devices; the careful examination and repair or reconstruction of the lateral compartment in selected patients; and the use of unaggressive rehabilitation. We prospectively evaluated a series of 100 consecutive patients who underwent ACL reconstruction between 2001 and 2002. A clinical and radiological follow-up was performed at a minimum of 6 years. After 6 years, the International Knee Documentation Committee score demonstrated good-to-excellent results (A and B) in 98% of patients. However, arthrometric results using the KT-1000 demonstrated that 6/80 patients (7.5%) had >5 mm manual maximum side-to-side difference. The median Tegner activity score was 5 (range 1-9); the median Lysholm score was 96 (range 81-100); and the median subjective IKDC score was 94 (range 66-100). We reported 6/80 failures as revealed by a 2+ or 3+ pivot-shift test result and/or KT-1000 side-to-side difference of more than 5 mm. The IKDC score revealed excellent results in all women who underwent extra-articular tenodesis. Radiographic evaluation demonstrated early signs of osteoarthritis in 9% of patients.",

      "# Title: Addition of anterolateral ligament reconstruction to primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction could benefit recovery of functional outcomes.\n# Abstract: This study aimed to compare functional outcomes sequentially up to 1 year after combined anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR) and isolated ACLR. Fifty patients who underwent ACLR with versus without ALLR were analyzed at four different time points (preoperatively and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively). For the functional outcomes, muscle strength and acceleration time (AT) were measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. Proprioception was evaluated using joint position sense and dynamic postural stability. Patient-reported outcomes were measured using the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK-11) scores. Functional performance was assessed using single-leg hop distance (SLHD) and Limb Symmetry Index. In the operated knees, quadriceps (at 6 months postoperatively, p = 0.003) and hamstring (at 6 and 12 months postoperatively, p < 0.001) strength were significantly higher in the combined ACLR and ALLR group than the isolated ACLR group. The TSK-11 (at 6 and 12 months postoperatively, p < 0.001) was significantly lower in the combined ACLR and ALLR group than the isolated ACLR group. SLHD was significantly higher in the combined ACLR and ALLR group than the isolated ACLR group (at 6 months, p = 0.022 and at 12 months, p = 0.024). The addition of ALLR to primary ACLR yielded better muscle performance, fear of movement, and functional performance than isolated ACLR."

    "referenceConclusion": "The evidence is robust for a strongly elevated risk of tuberculosis with radiological silicosis, with a low disease severity threshold. The effect estimate is more uncertain for silica exposure without radiological silicosis. Research is needed, particularly cohort studies measuring silica exposure in different settings, to characterise the effect more accurately as well as the silica exposure threshold that could be used to prevent excess tuberculosis risk. The study provides to our knowledge the first systematic review of the epidemiological evidence for an association identified at least a century ago, viz. that occupational inhalation of silica dust increases the risk of pulmonary tuberculosis in co-exposed populations. In the current era, even with less severe forms of silicosis in traditional dusty industries, the evidence remains strong for a substantially elevated risk of tuberculosis in those with radiologically diagnosed disease. While there is evidence for an elevated risk of tuberculosis in those who have not been radiologically diagnosed with silicosis, the effect size is subject to uncertainty. Further studies are needed to characterise this effect, and particularly the exposure threshold that would avoid an excess risk of tuberculosis.",

Two occupational categories were extracted--\"mining, tunneling, and quarrying\" (n = 284) and \"iron and steel foundries\" (n = 428), respectively. Control groups were drawn from a national register of persons undergoing periodic health examinations with regard to silicosis risk. The controls were matched for occupation, age, and time of first exposure. The follow-up was performed through record-linkage operations to computerized information in Swedish Death Statistics, Swedish Cancer Register, and the Swedish Tuberculosis Index. End of follow-up was set at December 31, 1980. In cases drawn from mining, quarrying, and tunneling workers seven deaths in lung cancer were observed and two among the controls. Among iron and steel foundry workers the corresponding numbers were 10 and 6. The values for expected numbers, based on general population statistics, were 1.3 and 2.6, respectively, for these two occupational groups. When cancer incidence statistics were used, the case/control ratio for lung cancer was 2.1 for \"mining, quarrying, and tunneling\" and 0.6 for \"iron and steel foundries.\" There were 29 cases of lung tuberculosis registered among the silicosis cases during the follow-up period. Only one tuberculosis case was observed among the controls. The results demonstrate that persons with silicosis contracted in the mining, quarrying, and tunneling occupations are subject to an increased risk of lung cancer. The risk is observed when both the general population and a closely matched control population from the same occupations are used for values of reference. The results also demonstrate the high risk of persons with silicosis to contract lung tuberculosis.",

In this study, a cohort of 1,153 older gold miners with and without silicosis who had not had tuberculosis have been followed for 7 yr by a routine mine surveillance program for detection of tuberculosis. One hundred seventy-eight of the men developed tuberculosis. The annual incidence of tuberculosis was 981/100,000 in the 335 men without silicosis and 2,707/100,000 in the 818 men with silicosis. The relative risk for tuberculosis was 2.8 (95% CI, 1.9 to 4.1) for men with silicosis compared with that in the men without silicosis. The incidence of tuberculosis increased from 1% per annum (pa) for the men without silicosis to 2.2% pa for the men with silicosis with Category 1 nodule profusion, 2.9% pa for those with Category 2, and 6.3% pa for those with Category 3 silicosis. This study has confirmed and quantified the high risk of pulmonary and of extrapulmonary tuberculosis in men with silicosis. The incidence of tuberculosis during this 7-yr study suggests that one quarter of these men with silicosis will have developed tuberculosis by 60 yr of age.",

      "# Title: Risk factors for pulmonary mycobacterial disease in South African gold miners. A case-control study.\n# Abstract: Pulmonary mycobacterial disease is common in miners. Risk factors for nontuberculous pulmonary mycobacterial (NTM) disease and tuberculosis (TB) in gold miners were identified in a retrospective case-control study that included 206 NTM patients and 381 TB patients of known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status diagnosed between 1993 and 1996. A total of 180 HIV-tested trauma/surgical inpatients were selected as control patients. Both HIV infection (odds ratio [OR] 3.6 for NTM and 4.5 for TB patients) and higher grades of silicosis (OR 5.0 for NTM and 4.9 for TB patients) were significantly more common in NTM and TB patients than in control patients. HIV prevalence rose in the control and both case groups during the study period. The overall HIV prevalence was 13.1% in NTM patients, 14.2% in TB patients, and 5.6% in control patients. Previous TB (OR 9.6), premorbid focal radiological scarring (OR 7.4) and a dusty job at diagnosis (OR 2.4) were additional significant risk factors for NTM disease. These findings suggest that the historically high incidence of NTM disease in miners is largely attributable to chronic chest disease from silica dust inhalation and prior TB. HIV infection has recently become an additional risk factor for mycobacterial disease in miners and is likely to become increasingly important as the HIV epidemic progresses.",

In addition, there is no reliable information on the MTB infection rate of patients undergoing different types of renal replacement therapy (RRT). We used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database to conduct a 9-year nationwide longitudinal study. Among 49 983 ESRD patients who received three renal replacement modalities, there were 562 cases of MTB infection, corresponding to an incidence rate of 3.0 per 1000 patient-years. The risk of MTB infection relative to the general population was 4.5. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the independent risk factors for MTB infection in ESRD patients are old age (hazard ratio (HR) 1.17 per 10 years, p <0.001), male gender (HR 1.37, p <0.001), silicosis (HR 5.82, p <0.001), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 1.68, p 0.012).

After an adjusted regression analysis, the between-group difference in FIV (19.1 ml; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.2 to 25.2; P = 0.038) significantly favored the IA-SCI group. At 90 days, no differences were found in the proportion of patients who achieved functional independence (mRS 0-2) (51.1% versus. 41.2%, adjusted odd ratio (aOR) 1.9, 95% CI 0.8-2.6, P = 0.192). Combining short-duration IA-SCI with MT was safe. There was a smaller FIV and trend towards clinical benefit that will need to be further evaluated in randomized control trials.",

      "# Title: Effect of intravenous thrombolysis combined with mild hypothermia on the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in patients with acute cerebral infarction and clinical significance.\n# Abstract: The present study aimed to explore the effects and clinical importance of serum interleukin (IL) IL-1β, IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 in patients with acute cerebral infarction undergoing intravenous thrombolysis during simultaneous hypothermia therapy. A total of 80 patients with acute cerebral infarction who were treated at our hospital were randomly selected. They were divided into groups A and B. The two groups were treated with intravenous thrombolysis, while group B received sub-hypothermia treatment. Prior to treatment and at 7 days after treatment, 5 ml of venous blood was collected and stored in a freezer at -80˚C. IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 levels were detected by ELISA and compared between the groups and time-points. The results were as follows: i) At 7 days after treatment, the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in group B were significantly decreased compared with those in group A (P<0.05), while there was no significant difference of these levels between group A and B before treatment (P>0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions in group A and group B was 35 and 20% respectively, and the mortality rate was 10 and 5%, respectively. There were no significant differences in adverse events and mortality between the two groups (P>0.05). In addition, a positive correlation of the level of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was determined in the patients prior to treatment. In conclusion, mild hypothermia treatment in addition to intravenous thrombolysis significantly reduced the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in patients with acute cerebral infarction and reduced inflammation, and should therefore be incorporated in clinical practice.",

Our study evaluates the safety of appendectomy performed with SDD in pediatric patients when compared to appendectomy followed by an overnight stay, using a large nationwide database and a strict definition of SDD by using hospital length of stay (LOS). Methods: Using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric (NSQIP-P) registry, we identified patients younger than 18 years of age who underwent outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy, with SDD (n = 2647) or overnight stay (n = 5045). One-to-one propensity score matching was performed to compare 30-day readmission rates and postsurgical complications. Results: Non-Hispanic black race was associated with a higher likelihood of overnight stay after laparoscopic appendectomy. In the propensity score-matched analysis (N = 2443 pairs), SDD was not associated with an increased risk of 30-day unplanned readmission (odds ratio [OR] = 0.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.6-1.4; P = .667) or any 30-day complication (OR = 0.8, 95% CI: 0.6-1.1; P = .258). Conclusion: SDD after laparoscopic appendectomy in pediatric patients was not associated with an increased risk of 30-day hospital admission or complication rate.

Few data exist regarding the relationship of frailty with adverse outcomes in craniotomy for brain tumor resection. We assessed the relationship between frailty and the incidence of major post-operative complication, discharge destination other than home, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality after elective craniotomy for brain tumor resection. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 20,333 adult patients undergoing elective craniotomy for tumor resection in the 2012-2018 ACS-NSQIP Participant Use File. Multivariate logistic regression was performed using all covariates deemed eligible through clinical and statistical significance. 6,249 patients (30.7%) were low-frailty and 2,148 patients (10.6%) were medium-to-high frailty. In multivariate logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, BMI, ASA classification, smoking status, dyspnea, significant pre-operative weight loss, chronic steroid use, bleeding disorder, tumor type, and operative time, low frailty was associated with increased adjusted odds ratio of major complication (1.41, 95% CI: 1.23-1.60, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.32, 95% CI: 1.20-1.46, p < 0.001), 30-day readmission (1.29, 95% CI: 1.15-1.44, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (1.87, 95% CI: 1.41-2.47, p < 0.001). Moderate-to-high frailty was also associated with increased adjusted odds of major complication (1.61, 95% CI: 1.35-1.92, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.80, 95% CI: 1.58-2.05), 30-day readmission (1.39, 95% CI: 1.19-1.62, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (2.42, 95% CI: 1.74-3.38, p < 0.001).

Data on outcomes in patients with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for CTO, however, are scarce. A total of 2,002 consecutive patients undergoing PCI for CTO from January 2005 to December 2013 were divided into patients with and without previous CABG, and outcomes were retrospectively assessed. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality. Median follow-up was 2.6 years (interquartile range 1.1 to 3.1). A total of 292 patients (15%) had previous CABG; they were older and had a greater prevalence of comorbidities. Procedural success was achieved in 75% and 84% of patients in the previous CABG and the non-CABG groups (p <0.001), respectively. All-cause mortality was 16% and 11% in the previous CABG and the non-CABG groups (p = 0.002), and differences were mitigated after adjustment for baseline characteristics (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86 to 1.74, p = 0.27). All-cause death was significantly reduced in patients with procedural success, both in the previous CABG (11% vs 32%, adjusted HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.77, p = 0.005) and the non-CABG groups (10% vs 20%, adjusted HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.86, p = 0.004), with similar mortality benefits associated with successful revascularization in both groups (interaction p = 0.24).

When assessing quality of life for patients with brain tumors, having a better predictor of postsurgical outcome would be beneficial in counseling these patients. Frailty is thought to estimate physiologic reserves, and it has been found to predict postoperative complications, length of stay, and discharge to a skilled nursing facility or assisted living facility in patients undergoing various types of surgery. Frailty as an adjunct to preoperative assessment of neurosurgical patients has never been evaluated. This study aimed to determine whether frailty predicts neurosurgical complications in patients with brain tumors and enhances current perioperative risk models.",

      "# Title: Frailty and outcomes after craniotomy for brain tumor.\n# Abstract: Frailty has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in a variety of surgical disciplines. Few data exist regarding the relationship of frailty with adverse outcomes in craniotomy for brain tumor resection. We assessed the relationship between frailty and the incidence of major post-operative complication, discharge destination other than home, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality after elective craniotomy for brain tumor resection. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 20,333 adult patients undergoing elective craniotomy for tumor resection in the 2012-2018 ACS-NSQIP Participant Use File. Multivariate logistic regression was performed using all covariates deemed eligible through clinical and statistical significance. 6,249 patients (30.7%) were low-frailty and 2,148 patients (10.6%) were medium-to-high frailty. In multivariate logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, BMI, ASA classification, smoking status, dyspnea, significant pre-operative weight loss, chronic steroid use, bleeding disorder, tumor type, and operative time, low frailty was associated with increased adjusted odds ratio of major complication (1.41, 95% CI: 1.23-1.60, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.32, 95% CI: 1.20-1.46, p < 0.001), 30-day readmission (1.29, 95% CI: 1.15-1.44, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (1.87, 95% CI: 1.41-2.47, p < 0.001). Moderate-to-high frailty was also associated with increased adjusted odds of major complication (1.61, 95% CI: 1.35-1.92, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.80, 95% CI: 1.58-2.05), 30-day readmission (1.39, 95% CI: 1.19-1.62, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (2.42, 95% CI: 1.74-3.38, p < 0.001).

The two most commonly used autogenous grafts are the central third of the patellar tendon and the hamstring tendon constructs. The choice of different grafts and different construct influence the final clinical outcome of ACL reconstruction. The 3 groups, of 25 patients each, were generated by choosing the technique (PT tendon, 4 strand hamstring, and single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty) to utilize and followed for 5 years, with an alternate systematic sampling. Our comparison has shown significant kneeling pain in the patellar tendon with respect to the groups with hamstrings techniques. Single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty achieved subjective score significantly higher with respect to the other two groups as well as for the time to resume sport. The study confirms that patellar tendon and hamstring can be equivalent options for ACL reconstruction. This study demonstrated that a superior outcome as far as subjective clinical findings were concerned, was obtained in group III. Patients in the latter group were also able to return to sports sooner than those in the bone-patellar tendon graft group and the four-strand hamstring group.",

      "# Title: Long-Term Follow-Up of Patients With Previous Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for Chronic Total Occlusion.\n# Abstract: Successful revascularization of chronic total occlusions (CTOs) has been associated with clinical benefit. Data on outcomes in patients with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for CTO, however, are scarce. A total of 2,002 consecutive patients undergoing PCI for CTO from January 2005 to December 2013 were divided into patients with and without previous CABG, and outcomes were retrospectively assessed. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality. Median follow-up was 2.6 years (interquartile range 1.1 to 3.1). A total of 292 patients (15%) had previous CABG; they were older and had a greater prevalence of comorbidities. Procedural success was achieved in 75% and 84% of patients in the previous CABG and the non-CABG groups (p <0.001), respectively. All-cause mortality was 16% and 11% in the previous CABG and the non-CABG groups (p = 0.002), and differences were mitigated after adjustment for baseline characteristics (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86 to 1.74, p = 0.27). All-cause death was significantly reduced in patients with procedural success, both in the previous CABG (11% vs 32%, adjusted HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.77, p = 0.005) and the non-CABG groups (10% vs 20%, adjusted HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.86, p = 0.004), with similar mortality benefits associated with successful revascularization in both groups (interaction p = 0.24). In conclusion, the relative survival benefit of successful recanalization of CTO is independent of previous CABG. However, owing to a greater baseline risk, the absolute survival benefit of successful CTO procedures is more pronounced in patients with previous CABG than in non-CABG patients.",

    "referenceConclusion": "High PM 2.5 exposure is one of the most important avoidable hazards to human health. The effects on hematological systems have been less well-studied. There were fewer than 20 available entries in the web search according to the Cochrane recommendation as the damages are not easily analyzed and are mostly unnoticed. All available studies found harmful effects of long-term exposure to PM 2.5 to the hematopoietic system. Hematological parameter changes in people exposed to medium to high PM 2.5 concentrations for more than a year are summarized in Table 2 . The pathophysiology of PM 2.5 pollution may be from increased inflammatory responses affecting each hematological component. For the public, avoidance of exposure and reduction in PM 2.5 pollution should be encouraged. Interventions should be focused on the high-risk groups including the elderly with cardiovascular diseases, young children, and pregnant women. Personal facemasks can minimize inhaled small particles and reduce pollution exposure time. Air purifiers also lessen indoor pollution concentrations. Improving air quality has to be addressed for the general population. Decreasing PM 2.5 pollution is essential to prevent hematological adverse events. Further studies are needed to determine whether reducing PM 2.5 exposure can decrease these disorders. Pathophysiology of PM 2.5 effects on individual hematologic parameters and the high-risk groups. High PM 2.5 : A 24-h mean level between 25 and 50 μg/m 3 or annual mean over 10 μg/m 3 . Very high PM 2.5 : A 24-h mean level over 50 μg/m 3 .",

      "# Title: Particulate matter air pollution and cardiovascular disease: An update to the scientific statement from the American Heart Association.\n# Abstract: In 2004, the first American Heart Association scientific statement on \"Air Pollution and Cardiovascular Disease\" concluded that exposure to particulate matter (PM) air pollution contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In the interim, numerous studies have expanded our understanding of this association and further elucidated the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved. The main objective of this updated American Heart Association scientific statement is to provide a comprehensive review of the new evidence linking PM exposure with cardiovascular disease, with a specific focus on highlighting the clinical implications for researchers and healthcare providers. The writing group also sought to provide expert consensus opinions on many aspects of the current state of science and updated suggestions for areas of future research. On the basis of the findings of this review, several new conclusions were reached, including the following: Exposure to PM <2.5 microm in diameter (PM(2.5)) over a few hours to weeks can trigger cardiovascular disease-related mortality and nonfatal events; longer-term exposure (eg, a few years) increases the risk for cardiovascular mortality to an even greater extent than exposures over a few days and reduces life expectancy within more highly exposed segments of the population by several months to a few years; reductions in PM levels are associated with decreases in cardiovascular mortality within a time frame as short as a few years; and many credible pathological mechanisms have been elucidated that lend biological plausibility to these findings. It is the opinion of the writing group that the overall evidence is consistent with a causal relationship between PM(2.5) exposure and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This body of evidence has grown and been strengthened substantially since the first American Heart Association scientific statement was published. Finally, PM(2.5) exposure is deemed a modifiable factor that contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.",

      "# Title: Effects of particulate matter exposure on blood 5-hydroxymethylation: results from the Beijing truck driver air pollution study.\n# Abstract: Previous studies have reported epigenetic changes induced by environmental exposures. However, previous investigations did not distinguish 5-methylcytosine (5mC) from a similar oxidative form with opposite functions, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Here, we measured blood DNA global 5mC and 5hmC by ELISA and used adjusted mixed-effects regression models to evaluate the effects of ambient PM10 and personal PM2.5 and its elemental components-black carbon (BC), aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), iron (Fe), sulfur (S), silicon (Si), titanium (Ti), and zinc (Zn)-on blood global 5mC and 5hmC levels. The study was conducted in 60 truck drivers and 60 office workers in Beijing, China from The Beijing Truck Driver Air Pollution Study at 2 exams separated by one to 2 weeks. Blood 5hmC level (0.08%) was ∼83-fold lower than 5mC (6.61%). An inter-quartile range (IQR) increase in same-day PM10 was associated with increases in 5hmC of 26.1% in office workers (P = 0.004), 20.2% in truck drivers (P = 0.014), and 21.9% in all participants combined (P < 0.001). PM10 effects on 5hmC were increasingly stronger when averaged over 4, 7, and 14 d preceding assessment (up to 132.6% for the 14-d average in all participants, P < 0.001). PM10 effects were also significant after controlling for multiple testing (family-wise error rate; FWER < 0.05). 5hmC was not correlated with personal measures of PM2.5 and elemental components (FWER > 0.05). 5mC showed no correlations with PM10, PM2.5, and elemental components measures (FWER > 0.05). Our study suggests that exposure to ambient PM10 affects 5hmC over time, but not 5mC. This finding demonstrates the need to differentiate 5hmC and 5mC in environmental studies of DNA methylation.",
      "# Title: Environmental nanoparticles are significantly over-expressed in acute myeloid leukemia.\n# Abstract: The increase in the incidence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) may suggest a possible environmental etiology. PM2.5 was declared by IARC a Class I carcinogen. No report has focused on particulate environmental pollution together with AML. The study investigated the presence and composition of particulate matter in blood with a Scanning Electron Microscope coupled with an Energy Dispersive Spectroscope, a sensor capable of identifying the composition of foreign bodies. 38 peripheral blood samples, 19 AML cases and 19 healthy controls, were analyzed. A significant overload of particulate matter-derived nanoparticles linked or aggregated to blood components was found in AML patients, while almost absent in matched healthy controls. Two-tailed Student's t-test, MANOVA and Principal Component Analysis indicated that the total numbers of aggregates and particles were statistically different between cases and controls (MANOVA, P<0.001 and P=0.009 respectively). The particles detected showed to contain highly-reactive, non-biocompatible and non-biodegradable metals; in particular, micro- and nano-sized particles grouped in organic/inorganic clusters, with statistically higher frequency of a subgroup of elements in AML samples. The demonstration, for the first time, of an overload of nanoparticles linked to blood components in AML patients could be the basis for a possible, novel pathogenetic mechanism for AML development.",

      "# Title: Increased Outdoor PM2.5 Concentration Is Associated with Moderate/Severe Anemia in Children Aged 6-59 Months in Lima, Peru.\n# Abstract: Anemia affects 1.62 billion people worldwide. Although iron deficiency is the main cause of anemia, several other factors may explain its high prevalence. In this study, we sought to analyze the association between outdoor particulate matter PM2.5 levels with anemia prevalence in children aged 6-59 months residing in Lima, Peru (n = 139,368), one of the cities with the worst air pollution in Latin America. The study period was from 2012 to 2016. Anemia was defined according to the World Health Organization (Hb < 11 g/dL). PM2.5 values were estimated by a mathematical model that combined data observed from monitors, with satellite and meteorological data. PM2.5 was analyzed by quintiles. Multiple linear and logistic regressions were used to estimate the associations between hemoglobin concentration (beta) and anemia (odds ratio) with PM2.5, after adjusting by covariates. Prevalence of anemia was 39.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 39.3-39.9). Mild anemia was observed in 30.8% of children and moderate/severe in 8.84% of children. Anemic children compared with nonanemic children are mainly males, have low body weight, higher rate of stunting, and live in an environment with high PM2.5 concentration. A slight decrease in hemoglobin (4Q B: -0.03, 95% CI: -0.05 to -0.02; 5Q B: -0.04, 95% CI: -0.06 to -0.01) and an increase in the probability of moderate/severe anemia (4Q OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.10-1.27; 5Q OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.08-1.29) were observed with increased exposure to PM2.5. We conclude that outdoor PM2.5 levels were significantly associated with decreased hemoglobin values and an increase in prevalence of moderate/severe anemia in children under 5 years old.",

      "# Title: Residential Exposure to PM2.5 Components and Risk of Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in Denmark: A Nationwide Register-Based Case-Control Study.\n# Abstract: In a recent study, we observed an increased risk of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) associated with exposure to fine atmospheric particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon (BC). In this nationwide register-based case-control study, we focus on specific components of PM2.5 in relation to childhood NHL in Denmark (1981-2013) by identifying all incidents of childhood NHL cases in the Danish Cancer Registry (n = 170) and four (cancer-free) randomly selected controls matched by date of birth and sex. We applied PM2.5 concentrations and the following sub-components: secondary organic aerosols (SOA), secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA; i.e., NO3-, NH4+ and SO42-), BC, organic carbon (OC) and sea salt. We calculated a time-weighted exposure average from birth to index-date at all addresses. Odds ratios (ORs) were adjusted for register-based socio-demographic variables. We observed adjusted ORs and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of 2.05 (1.10, 3.83) per interquartile range (IQR, 4.83 µg/m3) PM2.5 and 1.73 (0.68, 4.41) per IQR (3.71 µg/m3) SIA, 0.95 (0.71, 1.29) per IQR (0.05 µg/m3) SOA, 1.22 (1.02, 1.46) per IQR (0.39 µg/m3) BC, 1.02 (0.83, 1.26) per IQR (0.56 µg/m3) OC and 1.01 (0.79, 1.30) per IQR (0.87 µg/m3) sea salt, respectively. The estimates were attenuated after adjustment for PM2.5, whereas the OR for PM2.5 remained increased regardless of adjustment for specific components. The findings indicate that the previously observed relation between PM2.5 and childhood NHL may be related to BC (as reported in our previous study) but also partly to SIA, but the role of specific chemical components of PM2.5 remains ambiguous."

The aim was to understand the impact of endometriosis on implantation, pregnancy and live birth rates in menopausal recipients. A total of 240 menopausal recipients of donated sibling oocytes, were divided in two groups. Group I consisted of 120 recipients diagnosed with endometriosis and group II consisted of 120 controls. The implantation and pregnancy rates were significantly lower in the endometriosis group compared with the control group (23.81% versus 31.48%, P=0.019; 45.00% versus 58.33%, P=0.039, respectively). In oocyte donation cycles, a recipient's history of endometriosis might have a negative impact on implantation, pregnancy and live birth rates, even in menopausal women. Infertility in endometriosis may be due to poor oocyte quality or embryos with decreased ability to implant due to impaired fertilization. There are no conclusive data on the impact of endometriosis on implantation.

This single-center study was conducted to assess the accuracy of SWE in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), in comparison with transient elastography (TE), by using liver biopsy (LB) as the reference standard. Consecutive patients with CHC scheduled for LB by referring physicians were studied. One hundred and twenty-one patients met inclusion criteria. On the same day, real-time SWE using the ultrasound (US) system, Aixplorer (SuperSonic Imagine S.A., Aix-en-Provence, France), TE using FibroScan (Echosens, Paris, France), and US-assisted LB were consecutively performed. Fibrosis was staged according to the METAVIR scoring system. Analyses of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were performed to calculate optimal area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for F0-F1 versus F2-F4, F0- F2 versus F3-F4, and F0-F3 versus F4 for both real-time SWE and TE. Liver stiffness values increased in parallel with degree of liver fibrosis, both with SWE and TE.

With this index, the intra-observer acquisition variability assessed by comparing consecutive scans of the same patient was 17% and 32% for HG and LG clips, respectively. The measurement quantification variability assessed by comparing the measurements of a radiologist with those of a trained operator and of two automatic measurements on a same clip averaged 13% and 22% for HG and LG exams, respectively. It was found that SWE measurements depend greatly on the quality of the acquired data.

      "# Title: Performance of 2-D shear wave elastography in liver fibrosis assessment compared with serologic tests and transient elastography in clinical routine.\n# Abstract: Liver stiffness values assessed with 2-D shear wave elastography (SWE), transient elastography (TE) and simple serologic tests were compared with respect to non-invasive assessment in a cohort of 127 consecutive patients with chronic liver diseases. The rate of reliable liver stiffness measurements was significantly higher with 2-D SWE than with TE: 99.2% versus 74.8%, p < 0.0001 (different reliability criteria used, according to current recommendations). In univariate analysis, liver stiffness measured with 2-D SWE correlated best with fibrosis stage estimated with TE (r = 0.699, p < 0.0001), followed by Forns score (r = 0.534, p < 0.0001) and King's score (r = 0.512, p < 0.0001). However, in multivariate analysis, only 2-D SWE-measured values remained correlated with fibrosis stage (p < 0.0001). The optimal 2-D SWE cutoff values for predicting significant fibrosis were 8.03 kPa for fibrosis stage ≥2 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.832) and 13.1 kPa for fibrosis stage 4 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.915), respectively. In conclusion, 2-D SWE can be used to obtain reliable liver stiffness measurements in almost all patients and performs very well in predicting the presence of liver cirrhosis.",
      "# Title: Assessment of liver fibrosis with 2-D shear wave elastography in comparison to transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse imaging in patients with chronic liver disease.\n# Abstract: Two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2-D SWE) is an ultrasound-based elastography method integrated into a conventional ultrasound machine. It can evaluate larger regions of interest and, therefore, might be better at determining the overall fibrosis distribution. The aim of this prospective study was to compare 2-D SWE with the two best evaluated liver elastography methods, transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse (point SWE using acoustic radiation force impulse) imaging, in the same population group. The study included 132 patients with chronic hepatopathies, in which liver stiffness was evaluated using transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging and 2-D SWE. The reference methods were liver biopsy for the assessment of liver fibrosis (n = 101) and magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography for the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis (n = 31). No significant difference in diagnostic accuracy, assessed as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), was found between the three elastography methods (2-D SWE, transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging) for the diagnosis of significant and advanced fibrosis and liver cirrhosis in the \"per protocol\" (AUROCs for fibrosis stages ≥2: 0.90, 0.95 and 0.91; for fibrosis stage [F] ≥3: 0.93, 0.95 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.92, 0.96 and 0.92) and \"intention to diagnose\" cohort (AUROCs for F ≥2: 0.87, 0.92 and 0.91; for F ≥3: 0.91, 0.93 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.88, 0.90 and 0.89).

The goal of this study was to assess the clinical use of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) evaluated by supersonic shear imaging (SSI), FibroScan, and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) in a cohort of NAFLD patients who underwent liver biopsy. A total of 291 NAFLD patients were prospectively enrolled from November 2011 to February 2015 at 2 French university hospitals. LSM was assessed by SSI, FibroScan (M probe), and ARFI within two weeks prior to liver biopsy. Calculations of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) were performed and compared for the staging of liver fibrosis. AUROC for SSI, FibroScan, and ARFI were 0.86, 0.82, and 0.77 for diagnoses of ≥F2; 0.89, 0.86, and 0.84 for ≥F3; and 0.88, 0.87, and 0.84 for F4, respectively. SSI had a higher accuracy than ARFI for diagnoses of significant fibrosis (≥F2) (P = 0.004). Clinical factors related to obesity such as body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2) , waist circumference ≥102 cm or increased parietal wall thickness were associated with LSM failures when using SSI or FibroScan and with unreliable results when using ARFI. In univariate analysis, FibroScan values were slightly correlated with NAFLD activity score and steatosis (R = 0.28 and 0.22, respectively), whereas SSI and ARFI were not; however, these components of NAFLD did not affect LSM results in multivariate analysis. The cutoff values for SSI and FibroScan for staging fibrosis with a sensitivity ≥90% were very close: 6.3/6.2 kPa for ≥F2, 8.3/8.2 kPa for ≥F3, and 10.5/9.5 kPa for F4.",

Patients with CHB infection who underwent liver biopsy were consecutively included. After exclusions, 257 patients were analyzed. Two-dimensional SWE resulted in a significantly higher rate of reliable measurements (98.1%, 252/257) than TE (93.0%, 239/257) (p = 0.011). Liver stiffness measurements of the two examinations exhibited a strong correlation (r = 0.835, p < 0.001).

The purpose of this study was to perform an intra-individual comparison between 2-D shear wave elastography (2-D-SWE with a GE system) and Virtual Touch Tissue Quantification (VTTQ with a Siemens system) to assess whether these can be used interchangeably to grade fibrosis. Ninety-three patients (51 men, 42 women; mean age, 54 y) with liver disease of various etiologies (hepatitis B virus = 47, hepatitis C virus = 22; alcohol = 6, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis = 5, other = 13) were included. Using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values, liver fibrosis was classified into clinically non-significant (F0/F1) and significant (≥F2) fibrosis. Results indicated that intra-modality repeatability was excellent for both techniques (GE 2-D-SWE: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.89 [0.84-0.93]; VTTQ: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.90 [0.86-0.93]). Intra-modality classification agreement for fibrosis grading was good to excellent (GE 2-D-SWE: κ = 0.65, VTTQ: κ = 0.82). However, inter-modality agreement for fibrosis grading was only fair (κ = 0.31) using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values of fibrosis. In conclusion, although both GE 2-D-SWE and Siemens VTTQ exhibit good to excellent intra-modality repeatability, inter-modality agreement is only fair, suggesting that these should not be used interchangeably.",

The aim was to understand the impact of endometriosis on implantation, pregnancy and live birth rates in menopausal recipients. A total of 240 menopausal recipients of donated sibling oocytes, were divided in two groups. Group I consisted of 120 recipients diagnosed with endometriosis and group II consisted of 120 controls. The implantation and pregnancy rates were significantly lower in the endometriosis group compared with the control group (23.81% versus 31.48%, P=0.019; 45.00% versus 58.33%, P=0.039, respectively). In oocyte donation cycles, a recipient's history of endometriosis might have a negative impact on implantation, pregnancy and live birth rates, even in menopausal women. Infertility in endometriosis may be due to poor oocyte quality or embryos with decreased ability to implant due to impaired fertilization. There are no conclusive data on the impact of endometriosis on implantation. The already-known adverse effect of endometriosis on gamete quality makes it more difficult to demonstrate a direct effect of endometriosis on implantation. In order to eliminate these confounding effects we studied a population of menopausal recipients with and without endometriosis sharing sibling oocytes coming from the same oocyte donor.

In order to eliminate these confounding effects, this prospective comparative study studied a population of menopausal recipients with and without endometriosis sharing sibling oocytes coming from the same donor. The aim was to understand the impact of endometriosis on implantation, pregnancy and live birth rates in menopausal recipients. A total of 240 menopausal recipients of donated sibling oocytes, were divided in two groups. Group I consisted of 120 recipients diagnosed with endometriosis and group II consisted of 120 controls. The implantation and pregnancy rates were significantly lower in the endometriosis group compared with the control group (23.81% versus 31.48%, P=0.019; 45.00% versus 58.33%, P=0.039, respectively). In oocyte donation cycles, a recipient's history of endometriosis might have a negative impact on implantation, pregnancy and live birth rates, even in menopausal women. Infertility in endometriosis may be due to poor oocyte quality or embryos with decreased ability to implant due to impaired fertilization. There are no conclusive data on the impact of endometriosis on implantation. The already-known adverse effect of endometriosis on gamete quality makes it more difficult to demonstrate a direct effect of endometriosis on implantation. In order to eliminate these confounding effects we studied a population of menopausal recipients with and without endometriosis sharing sibling oocytes coming from the same oocyte donor. The oocyte donation model was used in an attempt to understand whether the endometrium, the oocytes or both are affected by endometriosis. The aim of the present study was to understand the impact of endometriosis on implantation, pregnancy and live birth rates in menopausal recipients. A total of 240 menopausal recipients of donated sibling oocytes were divided into two groups. Group I consisted of 120 recipients diagnosed with endometriosis and group II consisted of 120 controls. The pregnancy and implantation rates were significantly lower in the endometriosis group compared to the control group (45.00% versus 58.33%, P=0.039) and (23.81% versus 31.48%, P=0.019) respectively.

    "referenceConclusion": "The evidence is robust for a strongly elevated risk of tuberculosis with radiological silicosis, with a low disease severity threshold. The effect estimate is more uncertain for silica exposure without radiological silicosis. Research is needed, particularly cohort studies measuring silica exposure in different settings, to characterise the effect more accurately as well as the silica exposure threshold that could be used to prevent excess tuberculosis risk. The study provides to our knowledge the first systematic review of the epidemiological evidence for an association identified at least a century ago, viz. that occupational inhalation of silica dust increases the risk of pulmonary tuberculosis in co-exposed populations. In the current era, even with less severe forms of silicosis in traditional dusty industries, the evidence remains strong for a substantially elevated risk of tuberculosis in those with radiologically diagnosed disease. While there is evidence for an elevated risk of tuberculosis in those who have not been radiologically diagnosed with silicosis, the effect size is subject to uncertainty. Further studies are needed to characterise this effect, and particularly the exposure threshold that would avoid an excess risk of tuberculosis.",

For the 18-year follow-up period, the following groups had statistically significant increased standard incidence rates (SIR) for pulmonary tuberculosis: silicotics, SIR = 1000 (95% CI = 272 to 2561, P less than .01); nonsilicotics employed at least 25 years, SIR = 353 (95% CI = 130 to 768, P less than .01); and for the entire cohort, SIR = 201 (95% CI = 125 to 397, P = .01).

Two occupational categories were extracted--\"mining, tunneling, and quarrying\" (n = 284) and \"iron and steel foundries\" (n = 428), respectively. Control groups were drawn from a national register of persons undergoing periodic health examinations with regard to silicosis risk. The controls were matched for occupation, age, and time of first exposure. The follow-up was performed through record-linkage operations to computerized information in Swedish Death Statistics, Swedish Cancer Register, and the Swedish Tuberculosis Index. End of follow-up was set at December 31, 1980. In cases drawn from mining, quarrying, and tunneling workers seven deaths in lung cancer were observed and two among the controls. Among iron and steel foundry workers the corresponding numbers were 10 and 6. The values for expected numbers, based on general population statistics, were 1.3 and 2.6, respectively, for these two occupational groups. When cancer incidence statistics were used, the case/control ratio for lung cancer was 2.1 for \"mining, quarrying, and tunneling\" and 0.6 for \"iron and steel foundries.\" There were 29 cases of lung tuberculosis registered among the silicosis cases during the follow-up period. Only one tuberculosis case was observed among the controls. The results demonstrate that persons with silicosis contracted in the mining, quarrying, and tunneling occupations are subject to an increased risk of lung cancer. The risk is observed when both the general population and a closely matched control population from the same occupations are used for values of reference. The results also demonstrate the high risk of persons with silicosis to contract lung tuberculosis.",

In this study, a cohort of 1,153 older gold miners with and without silicosis who had not had tuberculosis have been followed for 7 yr by a routine mine surveillance program for detection of tuberculosis. One hundred seventy-eight of the men developed tuberculosis. The annual incidence of tuberculosis was 981/100,000 in the 335 men without silicosis and 2,707/100,000 in the 818 men with silicosis. The relative risk for tuberculosis was 2.8 (95% CI, 1.9 to 4.1) for men with silicosis compared with that in the men without silicosis. The incidence of tuberculosis increased from 1% per annum (pa) for the men without silicosis to 2.2% pa for the men with silicosis with Category 1 nodule profusion, 2.9% pa for those with Category 2, and 6.3% pa for those with Category 3 silicosis. This study has confirmed and quantified the high risk of pulmonary and of extrapulmonary tuberculosis in men with silicosis. The incidence of tuberculosis during this 7-yr study suggests that one quarter of these men with silicosis will have developed tuberculosis by 60 yr of age.",

      "# Title: Risk factors for pulmonary mycobacterial disease in South African gold miners. A case-control study.\n# Abstract: Pulmonary mycobacterial disease is common in miners. Risk factors for nontuberculous pulmonary mycobacterial (NTM) disease and tuberculosis (TB) in gold miners were identified in a retrospective case-control study that included 206 NTM patients and 381 TB patients of known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status diagnosed between 1993 and 1996. A total of 180 HIV-tested trauma/surgical inpatients were selected as control patients. Both HIV infection (odds ratio [OR] 3.6 for NTM and 4.5 for TB patients) and higher grades of silicosis (OR 5.0 for NTM and 4.9 for TB patients) were significantly more common in NTM and TB patients than in control patients. HIV prevalence rose in the control and both case groups during the study period. The overall HIV prevalence was 13.1% in NTM patients, 14.2% in TB patients, and 5.6% in control patients. Previous TB (OR 9.6), premorbid focal radiological scarring (OR 7.4) and a dusty job at diagnosis (OR 2.4) were additional significant risk factors for NTM disease. These findings suggest that the historically high incidence of NTM disease in miners is largely attributable to chronic chest disease from silica dust inhalation and prior TB. HIV infection has recently become an additional risk factor for mycobacterial disease in miners and is likely to become increasingly important as the HIV epidemic progresses.",

In addition, there is no reliable information on the MTB infection rate of patients undergoing different types of renal replacement therapy (RRT). We used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database to conduct a 9-year nationwide longitudinal study. Among 49 983 ESRD patients who received three renal replacement modalities, there were 562 cases of MTB infection, corresponding to an incidence rate of 3.0 per 1000 patient-years. The risk of MTB infection relative to the general population was 4.5. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the independent risk factors for MTB infection in ESRD patients are old age (hazard ratio (HR) 1.17 per 10 years, p <0.001), male gender (HR 1.37, p <0.001), silicosis (HR 5.82, p <0.001), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 1.68, p 0.012). Hyperlipidaemia (HR 0.71, p <0.001) and hypertension (HR 0.81, p 0.05) are associated with a lower infection rate. There was no effect of RRT modality on MTB infection rate.",

This single-center study was conducted to assess the accuracy of SWE in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), in comparison with transient elastography (TE), by using liver biopsy (LB) as the reference standard. Consecutive patients with CHC scheduled for LB by referring physicians were studied. One hundred and twenty-one patients met inclusion criteria. On the same day, real-time SWE using the ultrasound (US) system, Aixplorer (SuperSonic Imagine S.A., Aix-en-Provence, France), TE using FibroScan (Echosens, Paris, France), and US-assisted LB were consecutively performed. Fibrosis was staged according to the METAVIR scoring system. Analyses of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were performed to calculate optimal area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for F0-F1 versus F2-F4, F0- F2 versus F3-F4, and F0-F3 versus F4 for both real-time SWE and TE. Liver stiffness values increased in parallel with degree of liver fibrosis, both with SWE and TE. AUROCs were 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-0.96) for SWE and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.76-0.90) for TE (P = 0.002), 0.98 (95% CI: 0.94-1.00) for SWE and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.90-0.99) for TE (P = 0.14), and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.93-1.00) for SWE and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.91-0.99) for TE (P = 0.48), when comparing F0-F1 versus F2- F4, F0- F2 versus F3-F4, and F0 -F3 versus F4, respectively.",

Intra- and inter-operator reliability and repeatability were quantified in three different liver segments in a sample of 15 subjects, scanned during four independent sessions (two scans on day 1, two scans 1 wk later) by two operators. A total of 1440 measurements were made. Reproducibility was assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and a repeated measures analysis of variance. The shear wave speed was measured and used to estimate Young's modulus using the Supersonics Imagine Aixplorer. The median Young's modulus measured through the inter-costal space was 5.55 ± 0.74 kPa. The intra-operator reliability was better for same-day evaluations (ICC = 0.91) than the inter-operator reliability (ICC = 0.78). Intra-observer agreement decreased when scans were repeated on a different day. Inter-session repeatability was between 3.3% and 9.9% for intra-day repeated scans, compared with to 6.5%-12% for inter-day repeated scans. No significant difference was observed in subjects with a body mass index greater or less than 25 kg/m(2).",

The rate of reliable liver stiffness measurements was significantly higher with 2-D SWE than with TE: 99.2% versus 74.8%, p < 0.0001 (different reliability criteria used, according to current recommendations). In univariate analysis, liver stiffness measured with 2-D SWE correlated best with fibrosis stage estimated with TE (r = 0.699, p < 0.0001), followed by Forns score (r = 0.534, p < 0.0001) and King's score (r = 0.512, p < 0.0001). However, in multivariate analysis, only 2-D SWE-measured values remained correlated with fibrosis stage (p < 0.0001). The optimal 2-D SWE cutoff values for predicting significant fibrosis were 8.03 kPa for fibrosis stage ≥2 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.832) and 13.1 kPa for fibrosis stage 4 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.915), respectively.

      "# Title: Assessment of liver fibrosis with 2-D shear wave elastography in comparison to transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse imaging in patients with chronic liver disease.\n# Abstract: Two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2-D SWE) is an ultrasound-based elastography method integrated into a conventional ultrasound machine. It can evaluate larger regions of interest and, therefore, might be better at determining the overall fibrosis distribution. The aim of this prospective study was to compare 2-D SWE with the two best evaluated liver elastography methods, transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse (point SWE using acoustic radiation force impulse) imaging, in the same population group. The study included 132 patients with chronic hepatopathies, in which liver stiffness was evaluated using transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging and 2-D SWE. The reference methods were liver biopsy for the assessment of liver fibrosis (n = 101) and magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography for the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis (n = 31). No significant difference in diagnostic accuracy, assessed as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), was found between the three elastography methods (2-D SWE, transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging) for the diagnosis of significant and advanced fibrosis and liver cirrhosis in the \"per protocol\" (AUROCs for fibrosis stages ≥2: 0.90, 0.95 and 0.91; for fibrosis stage [F] ≥3: 0.93, 0.95 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.92, 0.96 and 0.92) and \"intention to diagnose\" cohort (AUROCs for F ≥2: 0.87, 0.92 and 0.91; for F ≥3: 0.91, 0.93 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.88, 0.90 and 0.89).

The goal of this study was to assess the clinical use of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) evaluated by supersonic shear imaging (SSI), FibroScan, and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) in a cohort of NAFLD patients who underwent liver biopsy. A total of 291 NAFLD patients were prospectively enrolled from November 2011 to February 2015 at 2 French university hospitals. LSM was assessed by SSI, FibroScan (M probe), and ARFI within two weeks prior to liver biopsy. Calculations of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) were performed and compared for the staging of liver fibrosis. AUROC for SSI, FibroScan, and ARFI were 0.86, 0.82, and 0.77 for diagnoses of ≥F2; 0.89, 0.86, and 0.84 for ≥F3; and 0.88, 0.87, and 0.84 for F4, respectively. SSI had a higher accuracy than ARFI for diagnoses of significant fibrosis (≥F2) (P = 0.004). Clinical factors related to obesity such as body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2) , waist circumference ≥102 cm or increased parietal wall thickness were associated with LSM failures when using SSI or FibroScan and with unreliable results when using ARFI. In univariate analysis, FibroScan values were slightly correlated with NAFLD activity score and steatosis (R = 0.28 and 0.22, respectively), whereas SSI and ARFI were not; however, these components of NAFLD did not affect LSM results in multivariate analysis. The cutoff values for SSI and FibroScan for staging fibrosis with a sensitivity ≥90% were very close: 6.3/6.2 kPa for ≥F2, 8.3/8.2 kPa for ≥F3, and 10.5/9.5 kPa for F4.",

There was a moderate correlation between SWE and TE (r = 0.511) in the diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis. The best cutoff values predicting significant hepatic fibrosis and liver cirrhosis by SWE were >1.78 m/s (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] = 0.777) and >2.24 m/s (AUROC = 0.935), respectively. SWE with a propagation map is a reliable method for predicting hepatic fibrosis regardless of operator experience.",

Patients with CHB infection who underwent liver biopsy were consecutively included. After exclusions, 257 patients were analyzed. Two-dimensional SWE resulted in a significantly higher rate of reliable measurements (98.1%, 252/257) than TE (93.0%, 239/257) (p = 0.011). Liver stiffness measurements of the two examinations exhibited a strong correlation (r = 0.835, p < 0.001). In patients given a confirmed histologic diagnosis, Spearman's rank coefficients were 0.520 in stage F0 (p < 0.001), 0.684 in stage F1 (p < 0.001), 0.777 in stage F2 (p < 0.001), 0.672 in stage F3 (p < 0.001) and 0.755 in stage F4 (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of 2-D SWE and TE for liver fibrosis staging (all p values > 0.05). Two-dimensional SWE had diagnostic accuracy comparable to that of TE for liver fibrosis staging. The measurements that the two techniques provide are not interchangeable.",

The purpose of this study was to perform an intra-individual comparison between 2-D shear wave elastography (2-D-SWE with a GE system) and Virtual Touch Tissue Quantification (VTTQ with a Siemens system) to assess whether these can be used interchangeably to grade fibrosis. Ninety-three patients (51 men, 42 women; mean age, 54 y) with liver disease of various etiologies (hepatitis B virus = 47, hepatitis C virus = 22; alcohol = 6, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis = 5, other = 13) were included. Using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values, liver fibrosis was classified into clinically non-significant (F0/F1) and significant (≥F2) fibrosis. Results indicated that intra-modality repeatability was excellent for both techniques (GE 2-D-SWE: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.89 [0.84-0.93]; VTTQ: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.90 [0.86-0.93]). Intra-modality classification agreement for fibrosis grading was good to excellent (GE 2-D-SWE: κ = 0.65, VTTQ: κ = 0.82). However, inter-modality agreement for fibrosis grading was only fair (κ = 0.31) using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values of fibrosis. In conclusion, although both GE 2-D-SWE and Siemens VTTQ exhibit good to excellent intra-modality repeatability, inter-modality agreement is only fair, suggesting that these should not be used interchangeably.",

Our study evaluates the safety of appendectomy performed with SDD in pediatric patients when compared to appendectomy followed by an overnight stay, using a large nationwide database and a strict definition of SDD by using hospital length of stay (LOS). Methods: Using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric (NSQIP-P) registry, we identified patients younger than 18 years of age who underwent outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy, with SDD (n = 2647) or overnight stay (n = 5045). One-to-one propensity score matching was performed to compare 30-day readmission rates and postsurgical complications. Results: Non-Hispanic black race was associated with a higher likelihood of overnight stay after laparoscopic appendectomy. In the propensity score-matched analysis (N = 2443 pairs), SDD was not associated with an increased risk of 30-day unplanned readmission (odds ratio [OR] = 0.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.6-1.4; P = .667) or any 30-day complication (OR = 0.8, 95% CI: 0.6-1.1; P = .258). Conclusion: SDD after laparoscopic appendectomy in pediatric patients was not associated with an increased risk of 30-day hospital admission or complication rate.

There were fewer than 20 available entries in the web search according to the Cochrane recommendation as the damages are not easily analyzed and are mostly unnoticed. All available studies found harmful effects of long-term exposure to PM 2.5 to the hematopoietic system. Hematological parameter changes in people exposed to medium to high PM 2.5 concentrations for more than a year are summarized in Table 2 . The pathophysiology of PM 2.5 pollution may be from increased inflammatory responses affecting each hematological component. For the public, avoidance of exposure and reduction in PM 2.5 pollution should be encouraged. Interventions should be focused on the high-risk groups including the elderly with cardiovascular diseases, young children, and pregnant women. Personal facemasks can minimize inhaled small particles and reduce pollution exposure time. Air purifiers also lessen indoor pollution concentrations. Improving air quality has to be addressed for the general population. Decreasing PM 2.5 pollution is essential to prevent hematological adverse events. Further studies are needed to determine whether reducing PM 2.5 exposure can decrease these disorders. Pathophysiology of PM 2.5 effects on individual hematologic parameters and the high-risk groups.

      "# Title: Particulate matter air pollution and cardiovascular disease: An update to the scientific statement from the American Heart Association.\n# Abstract: In 2004, the first American Heart Association scientific statement on \"Air Pollution and Cardiovascular Disease\" concluded that exposure to particulate matter (PM) air pollution contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In the interim, numerous studies have expanded our understanding of this association and further elucidated the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved. The main objective of this updated American Heart Association scientific statement is to provide a comprehensive review of the new evidence linking PM exposure with cardiovascular disease, with a specific focus on highlighting the clinical implications for researchers and healthcare providers. The writing group also sought to provide expert consensus opinions on many aspects of the current state of science and updated suggestions for areas of future research. On the basis of the findings of this review, several new conclusions were reached, including the following: Exposure to PM <2.5 microm in diameter (PM(2.5)) over a few hours to weeks can trigger cardiovascular disease-related mortality and nonfatal events; longer-term exposure (eg, a few years) increases the risk for cardiovascular mortality to an even greater extent than exposures over a few days and reduces life expectancy within more highly exposed segments of the population by several months to a few years; reductions in PM levels are associated with decreases in cardiovascular mortality within a time frame as short as a few years; and many credible pathological mechanisms have been elucidated that lend biological plausibility to these findings. It is the opinion of the writing group that the overall evidence is consistent with a causal relationship between PM(2.5) exposure and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This body of evidence has grown and been strengthened substantially since the first American Heart Association scientific statement was published. Finally, PM(2.5) exposure is deemed a modifiable factor that contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.",

However, previous investigations did not distinguish 5-methylcytosine (5mC) from a similar oxidative form with opposite functions, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Here, we measured blood DNA global 5mC and 5hmC by ELISA and used adjusted mixed-effects regression models to evaluate the effects of ambient PM10 and personal PM2.5 and its elemental components-black carbon (BC), aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), iron (Fe), sulfur (S), silicon (Si), titanium (Ti), and zinc (Zn)-on blood global 5mC and 5hmC levels. The study was conducted in 60 truck drivers and 60 office workers in Beijing, China from The Beijing Truck Driver Air Pollution Study at 2 exams separated by one to 2 weeks. Blood 5hmC level (0.08%) was ∼83-fold lower than 5mC (6.61%). An inter-quartile range (IQR) increase in same-day PM10 was associated with increases in 5hmC of 26.1% in office workers (P = 0.004), 20.2% in truck drivers (P = 0.014), and 21.9% in all participants combined (P < 0.001). PM10 effects on 5hmC were increasingly stronger when averaged over 4, 7, and 14 d preceding assessment (up to 132.6% for the 14-d average in all participants, P < 0.001). PM10 effects were also significant after controlling for multiple testing (family-wise error rate; FWER < 0.05). 5hmC was not correlated with personal measures of PM2.5 and elemental components (FWER > 0.05). 5mC showed no correlations with PM10, PM2.5, and elemental components measures (FWER > 0.05). Our study suggests that exposure to ambient PM10 affects 5hmC over time, but not 5mC. This finding demonstrates the need to differentiate 5hmC and 5mC in environmental studies of DNA methylation.",

PM2.5 was declared by IARC a Class I carcinogen. No report has focused on particulate environmental pollution together with AML. The study investigated the presence and composition of particulate matter in blood with a Scanning Electron Microscope coupled with an Energy Dispersive Spectroscope, a sensor capable of identifying the composition of foreign bodies. 38 peripheral blood samples, 19 AML cases and 19 healthy controls, were analyzed. A significant overload of particulate matter-derived nanoparticles linked or aggregated to blood components was found in AML patients, while almost absent in matched healthy controls. Two-tailed Student's t-test, MANOVA and Principal Component Analysis indicated that the total numbers of aggregates and particles were statistically different between cases and controls (MANOVA, P<0.001 and P=0.009 respectively). The particles detected showed to contain highly-reactive, non-biocompatible and non-biodegradable metals; in particular, micro- and nano-sized particles grouped in organic/inorganic clusters, with statistically higher frequency of a subgroup of elements in AML samples.

      "# Title: Increased Outdoor PM2.5 Concentration Is Associated with Moderate/Severe Anemia in Children Aged 6-59 Months in Lima, Peru.\n# Abstract: Anemia affects 1.62 billion people worldwide. Although iron deficiency is the main cause of anemia, several other factors may explain its high prevalence. In this study, we sought to analyze the association between outdoor particulate matter PM2.5 levels with anemia prevalence in children aged 6-59 months residing in Lima, Peru (n = 139,368), one of the cities with the worst air pollution in Latin America. The study period was from 2012 to 2016. Anemia was defined according to the World Health Organization (Hb < 11 g/dL). PM2.5 values were estimated by a mathematical model that combined data observed from monitors, with satellite and meteorological data. PM2.5 was analyzed by quintiles. Multiple linear and logistic regressions were used to estimate the associations between hemoglobin concentration (beta) and anemia (odds ratio) with PM2.5, after adjusting by covariates. Prevalence of anemia was 39.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 39.3-39.9). Mild anemia was observed in 30.8% of children and moderate/severe in 8.84% of children. Anemic children compared with nonanemic children are mainly males, have low body weight, higher rate of stunting, and live in an environment with high PM2.5 concentration. A slight decrease in hemoglobin (4Q B: -0.03, 95% CI: -0.05 to -0.02; 5Q B: -0.04, 95% CI: -0.06 to -0.01) and an increase in the probability of moderate/severe anemia (4Q OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.10-1.27; 5Q OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.08-1.29) were observed with increased exposure to PM2.5.

In this nationwide register-based case-control study, we focus on specific components of PM2.5 in relation to childhood NHL in Denmark (1981-2013) by identifying all incidents of childhood NHL cases in the Danish Cancer Registry (n = 170) and four (cancer-free) randomly selected controls matched by date of birth and sex. We applied PM2.5 concentrations and the following sub-components: secondary organic aerosols (SOA), secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA; i.e., NO3-, NH4+ and SO42-), BC, organic carbon (OC) and sea salt. We calculated a time-weighted exposure average from birth to index-date at all addresses. Odds ratios (ORs) were adjusted for register-based socio-demographic variables. We observed adjusted ORs and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of 2.05 (1.10, 3.83) per interquartile range (IQR, 4.83 µg/m3) PM2.5 and 1.73 (0.68, 4.41) per IQR (3.71 µg/m3) SIA, 0.95 (0.71, 1.29) per IQR (0.05 µg/m3) SOA, 1.22 (1.02, 1.46) per IQR (0.39 µg/m3) BC, 1.02 (0.83, 1.26) per IQR (0.56 µg/m3) OC and 1.01 (0.79, 1.30) per IQR (0.87 µg/m3) sea salt, respectively. The estimates were attenuated after adjustment for PM2.5, whereas the OR for PM2.5 remained increased regardless of adjustment for specific components. The findings indicate that the previously observed relation between PM2.5 and childhood NHL may be related to BC (as reported in our previous study) but also partly to SIA, but the role of specific chemical components of PM2.5 remains ambiguous."

      "# Title: Iron overload in cirrhosis-HFE genotypes and outcome after liver transplantation.\n# Abstract: Previously, we found appreciable hepatic iron deposition in one third of our patients undergoing liver transplantation (LTx) with approximately 10% of cases having quantifiable iron in the range of that seen in hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC). The aim of this study was to compare clinical outcome in liver transplant patients with and without iron overload. We also sought to determine the prevalence of HFE mutations in liver transplant patients with iron overload. Of 456 consecutive liver transplants, 41 explants had an hepatic iron index (HII) greater than 1.9, and these cases were compared to 41 matched liver transplant recipients without increased hepatic iron. Posttransplantation complications, along with patient and graft survival were monitored. HFE gene testing was performed using DNA-based techniques. Kaplan-Meier 5-year patient survival after LTx was significantly lower in cases with hepatic iron overload compared to matched controls without iron excess (48% vs. 77%; P =.045). Fatal infections (especially fungal) were more common in patients with iron overload (24% vs. 7%; P =.03). Of the 41 patients with a liver explant HII greater than 1.9, only 4 were C282Y homozygotes. Patients with severe hepatic explant iron overload undergoing LTx have a reduced survival compared to liver transplant recipients without explant iron excess. The reduced survival was attributable mainly to fatal bacterial and fungal infections. Despite the iron overload, HFE gene mutations were uncommon in patients with hepatic explant hemosiderosis.",
      "# Title: Association of hepatic iron overload with invasive fungal infection in liver transplant recipients.\n# Abstract: Invasive fungal infection is a serious complication of orthotopic liver transplantation, but its risk factors remain incompletely defined. Iron overload has already been associated with increased risk of fungal infections, but it has not yet been assessed as a risk factor in liver transplantation. We retrospectively studied a cohort of 153 consecutive patients who underwent their first liver transplantation at a single center and who survived at least 7 days after transplantation. The association between various pretransplant patient characteristics, including hepatic explant iron and risk of invasive fungal infections, was analyzed by univariate and multivariate models. Iron in the hepatic explant was assessed by Perl's Prussian blue stain by a pathologist blinded to clinical outcome. During the first year after transplantation, 28 of 153 patients developed a total of 31 invasive fungal infections, of which 21 (68%) were caused by Candida, 7 (23%) by Aspergillus, 2 (6%) by Cryptococcus, and 1 (3%) by Saccharomyces. Stainable iron in the hepatic explant was found in 48 patients (31%). Stainable iron in the hepatic explant was found to be strongly and independently associated with posttransplantation fungal infections in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 3.09; 95% confidence interval 1.45-6.56; P = 0.003). Hepatic iron overload is strongly and independently associated with posttransplantation invasive fungal infections. Studies to confirm this finding in other centers and define the mechanism are warranted.",
      "# Title: Serum ferritin concentration predicts mortality in patients awaiting liver transplantation.\n# Abstract: Additional markers are required to identify patients on the orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) waiting list at increased risk of death and adverse clinical events. Serum ferritin concentration is a marker of varied pathophysiological events and is elevated with increased liver iron concentration, hepatic necroinflammation, and systemic illness, all of which may cause a deterioration in liver function and clinical status. The aim of this study was to determine whether serum ferritin concentration is an independent prognostic factor in subjects awaiting OLT. This is a dual-center retrospective study. The study cohort consisted of 191 consecutive adults with cirrhosis accepted by the Queensland (Australia) Liver Transplant Service between January 2000 and June 2006 and a validation cohort of 131 patients from University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Transplant Center. In the study cohort, baseline serum ferritin greater than 200 microg/L was an independent factor predicting increased 180-day and 1-year waiting list mortality. This effect was independent of model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), hepatocellular carcinoma, age, and sex. Subjects with higher serum ferritin had increased frequency of liver-related clinical events. The relationship between serum ferritin and waiting list mortality was confirmed in the UCLA cohort; all deceased patients had serum ferritin greater than 400 microg/L. Serum ferritin greater than 500 microg/L and MELD were independent risk factors for death.",

      "# Title: Serum ferritin concentration and transferrin saturation before liver transplantation predict decreased long-term recipient survival.\n# Abstract: Serum ferritin (SF) concentration is a widely available parameter used to assess iron homeostasis. It has been described as a marker to identify high-risk patients awaiting liver transplantation (LT) but is also elevated in systemic immune-mediated diseases, metabolic syndrome, and in hemodialysis where it is associated with an inferior prognosis. This study analyzed whether SF is not only a predictor of liver-related mortality prior to LT but also an independent marker of survival following LT. In a dual-center, retrospective study, a cohort of 328 consecutive first-LT patients from Hannover Medical School, Germany (2003-2008, follow-up 1260 days), and 82 consecutive LT patients from Regensburg University Hospital, Germany (2003-2007, follow-up 1355 days) as validation cohort were analyzed. In patients exhibiting SF ≥365 μg/L versus <365 μg/L prior to LT, 1-, 3-, and 5-year post-LT survival was 73.3% versus 81.1%, 64.4% versus 77.3%, and 61.1% versus 74.4%, respectively (overall survival P = 0.0097), which was confirmed in the validation cohort (overall survival of 55% versus 83.3%, P = 0.005). Multivariate analyses identified SF ≥365 μg/L combined with transferrin saturation (TFS) <55%, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the survival after LT (SALT) score as independent risk factors for death. In patients with SF concentrations ≥365 μg/L and TFS <55%, overall survival was 54% versus 74.8% in the remaining group (P = 0.003). In the validation cohort, it was 28.6% versus 72% (P = 0.017), respectively.",
      "# Title: The association of pretransplant ferritin level with waiting list and post-transplant survival. Does ferritin actually predict outcome?\n# Abstract: Recent data suggest an association of serum ferritin (SF) with waiting list (WL) and postliver transplant (LT) outcomes. To assess the predictive capacity of SF on pre- and post-LT outcomes, and to identify whether recipient or donor liver siderosis is associated with post-LT survival; a retrospective analysis of 1079 patients assessed for first LT, 2000-2007 was performed. Iron deposition in the liver tissue was assessed using a semi-quantitative grading system. Median age was 54 (18-82) years and 67% were male. Seventeen per cent had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Median Model for End-stage Liver Disease MELD score was 14 (6-40), ferritin was 174 μg/l (4-4597) with 36.5% had a SF ≥ μg/l. Age (OR = 1.028) and MELD score (OR = 1.158) were independently associated with WL mortality (P < 0.001), whilst SF was not (P = NS). Age (OR = 1.018), HCC (OR = 1.542) and cold ischemia time (CIT) ≥ 10 h (OR = 1.418) were independently associated with post-LT survival (P < 0.05). Explant siderosis grade <2 was seen in 376 (71.7%) patients. Patients with explant siderosis grade ≥ 2 had inferior 12-month post-LT survival (P = 0.030). Presence of graft siderosis (15.8% of patients) was not associated with survival. In conclusion, we found a limited role for SF as a prognostic indicator for pre- or post-transplant survival.",
      "# Title: Iron-related markers are associated with infection after liver transplantation.\n# Abstract: Though serum iron has been known to be associated with an increased risk of infection, hepcidin, the major regulator of iron metabolism, has never been systematically explored in this setting. Finding early biomarkers of infection, such as hepcidin, could help identify patients in whom early empiric antimicrobial therapy would be beneficial. We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients (n = 128) undergoing first-time, single-organ orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) without known iron overload disorders at 2 academic hospitals in Boston from August 2009 to November 2012. Cox regression compared the associations between different iron markers and the development of first infection at least 1 week after OLT; 47 (37%) patients developed a primary outcome of infection at least 1 week after OLT and 1 patient died. After adjusting for perioperative bleeding complications, number of hospital days, and hepatic artery thrombosis, changes in iron markers were associated with the development of infection post-OLT including increasing ferritin (hazard ratio [HR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-2.05), rising ferritin slope (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.17), and increasing hepcidin (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.05-1.93). A decreasing iron (HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.20-2.57) and a decreasing iron slope (HR, 4.21; 95% CI, 2.51-7.06) were also associated with subsequent infections. In conclusion, hepcidin and other serum iron markers and their slope patterns or their combination are associated with infection in vulnerable patient populations.

      "# Title: Iron metabolism imbalance at the time of listing increases overall and infectious mortality after liver transplantation.\n# Abstract: Liver transplantation (LT) is the best treatment for patients with liver cancer or end stage cirrhosis, but it is still associated with a significant mortality. Therefore identifying factors associated with mortality could help improve patient management. The impact of iron metabolism, which could be a relevant therapeutic target, yield discrepant results in this setting. Previous studies suggest that increased serum ferritin is associated with higher mortality. Surprisingly iron deficiency which is a well described risk factor in critically ill patients has not been considered."

      "conclusionA": "**Primary Concluding Statement:**\n\nEvidence indicates a positive association between iron overload, measured by markers like ferritin, transferrin saturation, and hepatic iron concentration, and an increased risk of infectious complications following liver transplantation, particularly in the early post-transplant period and potentially more strongly for bacterial and fungal infections. This relationship is complex, influenced by the timing of iron overload (pre- vs. post-transplant), interaction with other risk factors like immunosuppression and underlying liver disease, and the specific type of infection. While managing iron overload is crucial for overall post-transplant outcomes, including long-term graft health, definitive evidence demonstrating that standard interventions like phlebotomy or chelation therapy specifically reduce the *incidence* of infectious complications as a primary outcome is limited, though controlling iron burden is considered vital for mitigating overall risk.",

      "# Title: Prospective and randomized evaluation of ACL reconstruction with three techniques: a clinical and radiographic evaluation at 5 years follow-up.\n# Abstract: A variety of graft sources have been used for ACL reconstruction to improve functions and kinematics in ACL deficient knees. The two most commonly used autogenous grafts are the central third of the patellar tendon and the hamstring tendon constructs. The choice of different grafts and different construct influence the final clinical outcome of ACL reconstruction. The 3 groups, of 25 patients each, were generated by choosing the technique (PT tendon, 4 strand hamstring, and single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty) to utilize and followed for 5 years, with an alternate systematic sampling. Our comparison has shown significant kneeling pain in the patellar tendon with respect to the groups with hamstrings techniques. Single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty achieved subjective score significantly higher with respect to the other two groups as well as for the time to resume sport. The study confirms that patellar tendon and hamstring can be equivalent options for ACL reconstruction. This study demonstrated that a superior outcome as far as subjective clinical findings were concerned, was obtained in group III. Patients in the latter group were also able to return to sports sooner than those in the bone-patellar tendon graft group and the four-strand hamstring group.",

The purpose of this prospective randomized study was to compare the clinical, instrumental and X-ray outcome of two ACL reconstruction techniques with hamstring tendons: one with a single intra-articular bundle associated to an extra-articular sling, the second with a more anatomic double-bundle technique that reproduces better the native ACL function. From an initial group of 100 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction, 72 patients (35 single bundle plus lateral plasty and 37 double bundle) were evaluated with IKDC, Tegner score, KT2000 arthrometer, Activity Rating Scale, Psychovitality Questionnaire and Ahlback radiographic score at a mean 3 years follow-up. Double-bundle group showed significantly better results regarding IKDC, ROM, Activity Rating Scale and time to return to sport. Also KT 2000 showed significant differences in objective stability.

      "# Title: Addition of anterolateral ligament reconstruction to primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction could benefit recovery of functional outcomes.\n# Abstract: This study aimed to compare functional outcomes sequentially up to 1 year after combined anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR) and isolated ACLR. Fifty patients who underwent ACLR with versus without ALLR were analyzed at four different time points (preoperatively and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively). For the functional outcomes, muscle strength and acceleration time (AT) were measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. Proprioception was evaluated using joint position sense and dynamic postural stability. Patient-reported outcomes were measured using the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK-11) scores. Functional performance was assessed using single-leg hop distance (SLHD) and Limb Symmetry Index. In the operated knees, quadriceps (at 6 months postoperatively, p = 0.003) and hamstring (at 6 and 12 months postoperatively, p < 0.001) strength were significantly higher in the combined ACLR and ALLR group than the isolated ACLR group. The TSK-11 (at 6 and 12 months postoperatively, p < 0.001) was significantly lower in the combined ACLR and ALLR group than the isolated ACLR group. SLHD was significantly higher in the combined ACLR and ALLR group than the isolated ACLR group (at 6 months, p = 0.022 and at 12 months, p = 0.024). The addition of ALLR to primary ACLR yielded better muscle performance, fear of movement, and functional performance than isolated ACLR."

    "referenceConclusion": "Pre-conditioning significantly reduced the severity of creatine kinase release, delayed-onset muscle soreness, loss of maximal voluntary contraction force and the range of motion decrease. Pre-conditioning may prevent severe EIMD and accelerate recovery of muscle force generation capacity. The current systematic review identified that pre-conditioning activities are effective in attenuating EIMD measures, CK, muscle soreness, ROM and maximal voluntary force production. These findings suggest the use of pre-conditioning activities prior to a strenuous bout of exercise does provide a significant protective effect when performed a minimum of 24 h prior to the damaging stimulus. Furthermore, the greater improvement in MVC suggests that the pre-conditioning activities may accelerate the recovery of muscle contractile properties following strenuous exercises. However, it is unclear if pre-conditioning would prevent EIMD from more complex exercises or to what extent EIMD prevention carries over into other modes of exercise.",

      "# Title: Muscle tenderness and peak torque changes after downhill running following a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: Unaccustomed exercise (usually of an eccentric nature) is often followed by delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Previous studies have found that prior eccentric activity produces a training effect which reduces DOMS and morphological changes. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a prior bout of maximal isokinetic eccentric exercise on DOMS, strength loss and plasma creatine kinase (CK) changes following a downhill run. Ten male subjects with a mean (+/- S.D.) age of 22.5 +/- 2.8 years, body mass of 62.67 +/- 0.05 kg and height of 176 +/- 3 cm were allocated to either a treatment group or a control group. The treatment group performed 100 maximal eccentric activations of the knee extensors in the dominant leg at 0.52 rad s-1. Two weeks later, the downhill run was performed on a motor-driven treadmill. This consisted of five bouts of 8 min at a gradient of -10% at a speed corresponding to 80% of the predicted maximal heart rate. The untrained group performed the downhill run as above but without the prior isokinetic session. Tenderness measurements, plasma CK activity and concentric and eccentric isokinetic peak torque measurements of the knee extensors at 0.52 and 2.83 rad s-1 were recorded prior to, immediately following and 2, 4 and 7 days after each protocol. The isokinetic protocol caused an increase (P < 0.01) in CK and tenderness and a decrease (P < 0.05) in concentric and eccentric torque at both speeds in the treatment group. Following the downhill run, a reduction in peak torque (P < 0.01) was observed in the eccentric and concentric modes at both isokinetic speeds in the control group. For the treatment group, the decrease in peak torque occurred only at the faster eccentric speed. With the exception of the faster eccentric speed, the decrement in peak torque was greater in the control group in all post-exercise isokinetic strength tests. There was less tenderness (P < 0.01) in the trained knee extensor muscle group. Peak torque also returned to pre-downhill values earlier for the trained group. Although plasma CK activity increased in both groups after downhill running, it was much lower (P < 0.01) in the trained group. The results suggest that a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric training reduces muscle damage, reduces the amount of strength loss and decreases the sensation of DOMS after downhill running.",
      "# Title: Exercise-induced skeletal muscle damage and adaptation following repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions.\n# Abstract: Repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions were used to examine indirect indices of exercise-induced muscle damage and adaptation in human skeletal muscle. Twenty-four subjects (18 females, 6 males) aged 20.0 +/- 1.4 years (mean +/- S.D.) performed an initial bout of either 10 (n = 7), 30 (n = 9) or 50 (n = 8) maximum voluntary eccentric contractions of the knee extensors, followed by a second bout of 50 contractions 3 weeks later using the same leg. Muscle soreness was elevated after all bouts (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon test), although the initial bout reduced the soreness associated with the second bout. Force loss and a decline in the 20:100 Hz percutaneous electrical myostimulation force ratio were observed after all exercise bouts (P < 0.01). Serum creatine kinase activity was elevated following the initial bouts of 30 and 50 repetitions (P < 0.01), but there was no increase following 10 repetitions. No increase in serum creatine kinase activity was observed in any group following the second bout of contractions (P > 0.05). We conclude that skeletal muscle adaptation can be brought about by a single bout of relatively few eccentric muscle contractions. Increasing the number of eccentric muscle repetitions did not result in an increased prophylactic effect on skeletal muscle.",
      "# Title: Influence of previous concentric exercise on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether a fatiguing concentric exercise performed immediately before eccentric exercise would exacerbate eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. One arm of nine female subjects (mean +/- s: 23.3 +/- 6.7 years) performed 12 maximal eccentric actions of the elbow flexors (ECC), and the other arm performed 100 repetitions of isokinetic concentric actions of the elbow flexors followed by the same eccentric exercise (CON-ECC). The two exercise regimens (ECC and CON-ECC) were separated by 2 weeks and presented in a counterbalanced order. Changes in muscle soreness level, maximal isometric force generation, relaxed and flexed elbow joint angle, upper arm circumference and plasma creatine kinase activity were compared between the ECC and CON-ECC conditions. All measures changed significantly after both ECC and CON-ECC; however, there were significant differences in the changes between the conditions. A lower level of soreness, a faster recovery of maximal isometric force generation, a smaller decrease in relaxed elbow joint angle and a smaller increase in upper arm circumference and creatine kinase activity were evident after the CON-ECC condition compared to the ECC condition. Thus, it would seem that muscle damage was attenuated by performance of previous concentric exercise. An additional experiment using a different group of subjects (n = 5) showed that warm-up exercise before the eccentric exercise also attenuated eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Acute adaptation to low volume eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: Many symptoms of eccentric muscle damage can be substantially reduced if a similar eccentric bout is repeated within several weeks of the initial bout.

      "# Title: The repeated bout effect of reduced-load eccentric exercise on elbow flexor muscle damage.\n# Abstract: In this study we investigated the extent to which an initial eccentric exercise consisting of two (2ECC) or six maximal eccentric actions (6ECC) of the elbow flexors would produce a similar effect to 24 maximal eccentric actions (24ECC), on a second bout of 24ECC performed 2 weeks later. Male students (n = 34) were assigned to one of three groups, and with their non-dominant arm performed either 2ECC (n = 12), 6ECC (n = 10), or 24ECC (n = 12) as a first bout of exercise. Two weeks later all groups performed 24ECC. Maximal isometric strength, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration were assessed before, immediately after, and for 4 days after exercise. Changes in all variables were compared between the bouts and groups by a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance. All variables changed significantly (P< 0.05) after 2ECC, 6ECC, and 24ECC, but the amount of change after 2ECC and 6ECC was significantly smaller (P<0.05) than both 6ECC and 24ECC, and 24ECC, respectively. After the second bout, the 6ECC and 24ECC groups showed a profound repeated bout effect, and no significant differences were found between the groups. All variables except muscle soreness were significantly (P< 0.05) larger after the second bout for the 2ECC group, however the changes observed after 24ECC were significantly smaller (P < 0.01) than those observed after the first 24ECC of the 24ECC group. These results suggest that it is not necessary to conduct a high number of eccentric actions in the first bout to elicit a repeated bout effect in a subsequent bout performed some time later.",

      "# Title: Intensity of eccentric exercise, shift of optimum angle, and the magnitude of repeated-bout effect.\n# Abstract: This study compared the effect of four different intensities of initial eccentric exercise (ECC1) on optimum angle shift and extent of muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise. Fifty-two male students were placed into 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% groups (n = 13 per group), performing 30 eccentric actions of the elbow flexors of 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% of maximal isometric strength [maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)] for ECC1, followed 2-3 wk later by a similar exercise (ECC2) that used 100% MVC load. MVC at six elbow joint angles, range of motion, upper arm circumference, serum creatine kinase activity, myoglobin concentration, and muscle soreness were measured before and for 5 days following ECC1 and ECC2. A rightward shift of optimum angle following ECC1 was significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 100% and 80% than for the 60% and 40% groups, and it decreased significantly (P < 0.05) from immediately to 5 days postexercise. By the time ECC2 was performed, only the 100% group kept a significant shift (4 degrees). Changes in most of the criterion measures following ECC1 were significantly greater for the 100% and 80% groups compared with the 60% and 40% groups. Changes in the criterion measures following ECC2 were significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 40% group compared with other groups. Although the magnitude of repeated bout effect following ECC2 was significantly (P < 0.05) smaller for the 40% and 60% groups, all groups showed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced changes in criterion measures following ECC2 compared with the ECC1 100% bout. We conclude that the repeated-bout effect was not dependent on the shift of optimum angle.",
      "# Title: Repeated bout effect after maximal eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: We hypothesized that a bout of high or low volume eccentric exercise would protect against muscle damage following a subsequent high volume bout and that adaptation would be attributable to neural changes, independent of the initial exercise volume. Sixteen males performed either 45 (ECC45) or 10 (ECC10) maximal eccentric contractions using the elbow flexors, followed by an ECC45 bout 2 weeks later. Damage markers were measured for the following 96 h; EMG and work done during the first 10 eccentric contractions were also recorded. CK, soreness, and decrements in MVC and range of motion (ROM) were greater in bout 1 than bout 2 (p < 0.01). Soreness, MVC and ROM were greater after the initial ECC45 bout compared to the initial ECC10 bout and the repeated bouts of ECC45 exercise in both groups (p < 0.01). Median frequency decreased from bout 1 to bout 2 (p < 0.001), no differences between groups were observed. An ECC45 bout of maximal eccentric exercise causes more initial damage than an ECC10 bout of maximal eccentric exercise, although both confer protection from subsequent ECC45 bouts of maximal eccentric contractions, which are attributable, at least in part, to a shift in the frequency content of EMG.",
      "# Title: A light load eccentric exercise confers protection against a subsequent bout of more demanding eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that a light eccentric exercise (ECC) that does not induce a loss of muscle function and delayed onset muscle soreness would confer a protective effect against a more strenuous ECC. Eighteen young men were randomly placed into two groups: 10-40% (n=9) and 40% (n=9). Subjects in the 10-40% group performed ECC of the elbow flexors (six sets of five reps) using a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (MVC) at an elbow joint angle of 90 degrees , followed 2 days later by ECC using a dumbbell weight of 40% MVC. Subjects in the 40% group performed the 40% ECC only. Changes in MVC, range of motion (ROM), upper arm circumference (CIR), plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and muscle soreness before, immediately after, 1-5 and 7 days following the 40% ECC were compared between groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any of the criterion measures were found immediately and 1-2 days after the 10% ECC. Following the 40% ECC, the 10-40% group showed significantly (P<0.05) smaller decreases in MVC and ROM, and smaller increases in muscle soreness compared with the 40% group, but no significant differences between groups were evident for CIR and plasma CK activity. These results suggest that the 10% ECC induced some protection against a subsequent bout of 40% ECC performed 2 days later. It appears that the light eccentric exercise preconditioned the muscles for exposure to the subsequent damaging eccentric exercise bout.",
      "# Title: Protection against muscle damage following fifty drop jumps conferred by ten drop jumps.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether 10 drop jumps (DJs) would confer protective effect against muscle damage and soreness in a subsequent bout of 50 DJs. Sixteen men were randomly placed into either a group performing 1 set of 10 DJs followed by 5 sets of 10 DJs (10-50, n = 8) or another group performing 2 bouts of 5 sets of 10 DJs (50-50, n = 8) separated by 2 weeks. The DJs were performed from a box height of 0.6 m, with a 10-second interval between jumps and a 1-minute rest between sets. Jump height, peak vertical ground reaction force, ground contact time, and heart rate during DJs were measured, and blood lactate concentration was assessed before and immediately after DJs. Changes in maximal isometric (ISO) and isokinetic concentric torque (CON), vertical jump, muscle soreness, and plasma creatine kinase activity before, immediately after, and at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours following exercise were compared between groups for the first and second bouts and between the bouts by a 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance. Changes in ISO, CON, vertical jump, and muscle soreness were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller for 10 DJs compared with 50 DJs; however, no significant differences in the measures between groups were evident following the second bout. The changes in the measures following 50 DJs in the 10-50 group were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller than those following the first bout of the 50-50 group. These results suggest that 10 DJs and 50 DJs conferred the same magnitude of protective effect against muscle damage by 50 DJs.",
      "# Title: Muscle damage protection by low-intensity eccentric contractions remains for 2 weeks but not 3 weeks.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that the protective effect conferred by a low-intensity eccentric exercise against maximal eccentric exercise would not last more than a week. Untrained men (21.3 ± 1.6 years) were allocated into either a control or one of four repeated bout groups (n = 13 per group). The repeated bout groups performed 30 low-intensity eccentric contractions (ECC) of the elbow flexors with a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (10%-ECC) either 2 days, 7 days (1 week), 14 days (2 weeks) or 21 days (3 weeks) before 30 maximal eccentric contractions (Max-ECC). The control group performed Max-ECC only. Changes in maximal voluntary contraction strength, optimum angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following 10%-ECC were analysed by a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Changes in the variables following Max-ECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. The 10%-ECC did not change any variables, showing no indication of muscle damage. The changes in all variables following Max-ECC were smaller (P < 0.05) for 2-day, 1- and 2-week groups than control group, without significant differences between 2-day and 1-week groups. The 2-week group showed greater (P < 0.05) changes in all variables compared with 2-day and 1-week groups. Changes in the variables were similar between 3-week and control groups, except for muscle soreness showing smaller (P < 0.05) changes for 3-week group. These results suggest that non-damaging eccentric exercise confers a protective effect against Max-Ecc, but the effect is attenuated between 1 and 2 weeks.",
      "# Title: Two maximal isometric contractions attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVC-ISO) would attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. Young untrained men were placed into one of the two experimental groups or one control group (n = 13 per group). Subjects in the experimental groups performed either two or 10 MVC-ISO of the elbow flexors at a long muscle length (20° flexion) 2 days prior to 30 maximal isokinetic eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors. Subjects in the control group performed the eccentric contractions without MVC-ISO. No significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction peak torque, peak torque angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and myoglobin concentration, muscle soreness, and ultrasound echo intensity were evident after MVC-ISO. Changes in the variables following eccentric contractions were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2 MVC-ISO group (e.g., peak torque loss at 5 days after exercise, 23% ± 3%; peak CK activity, 1964 ± 452 IU·L(-1); peak muscle soreness, 46 ± 4 mm) or the 10 MVC-ISO group (13% ± 3%, 877 ± 198 IU·L(-1), 30 ± 4 mm) compared with the control (34% ± 4%, 6192 ± 1747 IU·L(-1), 66 ± 5 mm). The 10 MVC-ISO group showed smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following eccentric contractions compared with the 2 MVC-ISO group. Therefore, two MVC-ISO conferred potent protective effects against muscle damage, whereas greater protective effect was induced by 10 MVC-ISO, which can be used as a strategy to minimize muscle damage.",

      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions attenuate muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise of the knee extensors in the elderly.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors would attenuate the magnitude of muscle damage induced by maximal eccentric exercise of the same muscle performed 7 days later using elderly individuals. Healthy older men (66.4 ± 4.6 years) were assigned to control or experimental (Exp) group (n = 13 per group). The control group performed six sets of ten maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC) of the knee extensors of non-dominant leg. The Exp group performed six sets of ten low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors on a leg extension machine by lowering a weight of 10 % maximal voluntary isometric knee extension strength (10 %ECC) 7 days prior to MaxECC. Changes in maximal voluntary isokinetic concentric torque (MVC-CON), angle at peak torque, range of motion (ROM), upper thigh circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin (Mb) concentration and B-mode ultrasound echo-intensity before and for 5 days after MaxECC were compared between groups by a mixed factor ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were observed following 10 %ECC. Following MaxECC, all variables changed significantly, and changes in all variables except for angle at peak torque were significantly different between groups. MVC-CON and ROM decreased smaller and recovered faster (P < 0.05) for Exp than control group, and changes in other variables were smaller (P < 0.05) for Exp group compared with control group. These results suggest that preconditioning knee extensor muscles with low-intensity eccentric contractions was effective for attenuating muscle damage induced by subsequent MaxECC of the knee extensors for elderly individuals.",
      "# Title: Effect of two maximal isometric contractions on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the elbow flexors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the time wise protective effect conferred by two maximal voluntary isometric contractions (2MVCs) at 20° elbow flexion on muscle damage induced by 30 maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors (MaxECC). Sixty-five young untrained men were randomly assigned to a control group that did not perform 2MVCs, or one of four experimental groups (n = 13 per group) who performed 2MVCs either immediately (0d), 2 (2d), 4 (4d) or 7 days (7d) before MaxECC. Changes in maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) concentric torque (MVC-CON), optimum angle (OA), range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following MaxECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were evident following 2MVCs. The 2d and 4d groups showed 16-62 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following MaxECC than the control, 0d and 7d groups. The 2d group showed 14-34 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables except for OA compared with the 4d group. The changes in the variables were similar among the control, 0d and 7d groups. These results show that 2MVCs that were performed between 2 and 4 days before MaxECC attenuated the magnitude of muscle damage, but no such effect was evident if the 2MVCs were performed immediately or 7 days before MaxECC. It is concluded that the protective effect conferred by 2MVCs is relatively short-lived, and there is a window for the effect to be conferred.",
      "# Title: Effect of a prior bout of preconditioning exercise on muscle damage from downhill walking.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether reduced-duration downhill walking (DW) would confer a protective effect against muscle damage induced by a subsequent bout of longer duration DW performed 1 week or 4 weeks later. Healthy young adults were allocated to a control or one of the preconditioning exercise (PRE-1wk or PRE-4wk) groups (10 men and 4 women per group). PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups performed 20-min DW (-28% slope, 5 km/h, 10% body mass added to a backpack) 1 week and 4 weeks before 40-min DW, respectively, and the control group performed 40-min DW only. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) knee extension torque, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity, and muscle soreness (100-mm visual analog scale) were measured before, immediately after, and 24, 48, and 72 h after DW, and the changes in these variables were compared among groups. The control group showed symptoms of muscle damage (e.g., prolonged decrease in MVC: -14% ± 10% at 48 h post-DW) after 40-min DW. Changes in all variables after 40-min DW of PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups were 54%-61% smaller (P < 0.05) than the control group, without significant differences between PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups for MVC and plasma CK activity. Importantly, changes after the preconditioning exercise (20-min DW) were 67%-69% smaller (P < 0.05) than those after the 40-min DW of the control group. These findings suggest that 20-min DW resulting in minor muscle damage conferred a protective effect against subsequent 40-min DW, and its effect could last for more than 4 weeks.",

      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors and flexors protect against muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the magnitude and duration of the protective effect of low-intensity eccentric contractions (LowEC) against damage induced by maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) of the knee flexors (KF) and extensors (KE). Young men were assigned to 8 experimental groups and 2 control groups (n = 13/group); the experimental groups performed LowEC of KF or KE 2 days (2d), 1 week (1wk), 2 weeks (2wk), or 3 weeks (3wk) before MaxEC, while the control groups performed MaxEC of KF or KE without LowEC. The 2d, 1wk, 2wk, and 3wk groups performed 30 LowEC of KF or 60 LowEC of KE with a load of 10% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction strength on a resistance-training machine, and all groups performed 30 MaxEC of KF or 60 MaxEC of KE on an isokinetic dynamometer. Several muscle damage markers were measured from before to 2 days after exercise (LowEC) or from before to 5 days after exercise (MaxEC). No significant changes in any variables were evident after LowEC. The changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2d and 1wk groups (e.g., peak creatine kinase activity: 1002 ± 501 IU/L; peak muscle soreness: 13 ± 5 mm) than for the control group (peak creatine kinase activity: 3005 ± 983 IU/L; peak muscle soreness 28 ± 6 mm) for both KE and KF. There were no significant differences between the 2d and 1wk groups or among the 2wk, 3wk, and control groups. These results show that LowEC provided 30%-66% protection against damage induced by MaxEC of KF and KE, and the protective effect lasted 1 week.",
      "# Title: Protective effect by maximal isometric contractions against maximal eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the knee extensors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) performed before maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) would attenuate muscle damage of the knee extensors. Untrained men were placed to an experimental group that performed 6 sets of 10 MVIC at 90° knee flexion 2 weeks before 6 sets of 10 MaxEC or a control group that performed MaxEC only (n = 13/group). Changes in muscle damage markers were assessed before to 5 days after each exercise. Small but significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction torque, range of motion (ROM) and plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity were evident at immediately to 2 days post-MVIC (p < 0.05), but other variables (e.g. thigh girth, myoglobin concentration, B-mode echo intensity) did not change significantly. Changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (p < 0.05) by 45% (soreness)-67% (CK) for the experimental than the control group. These results suggest that MVIC conferred potent protective effect against MaxEC-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Prevention of downhill walking-induced muscle damage by non-damaging downhill walking.\n# Abstract: Mountain trekking involves level, uphill, and downhill walking (DW). Prolonged DW induces damage to leg muscles, reducing force generating ability and muscle coordination. These increase risks for more serious injuries and accidents in mountain trekking, thus a strategy to minimize muscle damage is warranted. It has been shown that low-intensity eccentric contractions confer protective effect on muscle damage induced by high-intensity eccentric contractions. This study tested the hypothesis that 5-min non-damaging DW would attenuate muscle damage induced by 40-min DW, but 5-min level walking (LW) would not.",
      "# Title: Isometric pre-conditioning blunts exercise-induced muscle damage but does not attenuate changes in running economy following downhill running.\n# Abstract: Running economy (RE) is impaired following unaccustomed eccentric-biased exercises that induce muscle damage. It is also known that muscle damage is reduced when maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) are performed at a long muscle length 2-4 days prior to maximal eccentric exercise with the same muscle, a phenomenon that can be described as isometric pre-conditioning (IPC). We tested the hypothesis that IPC could attenuate muscle damage and changes in RE following downhill running. Thirty untrained men were randomly assigned into experimental or control groups and ran downhill on a treadmill (-15%) for 30 min. Participants in the experimental group completed 10 MVIC in a leg press machine two days prior to downhill running, while participants in the control group did not perform IPC. The magnitude of changes in muscle soreness determined 48 h after downhill running was greater for the control group (122 ± 28 mm) than for the experimental group (92 ± 38 mm). Isometric peak torque recovered faster in the experimental group compared with the control group (3 days vs. no full recovery, respectively). No significant effect of IPC was found for countermovement jump height, serum creatine kinase activity or any parameters associated with RE. These results supported the hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in markers of muscle damage. The hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in RE was not supported by our data. It appears that the mechanisms involved in changes in markers of muscle damage and parameters associated with RE following downhill running are not completely shared.",

However, it is not known whether this strategy could be applied to other muscles. This study investigated whether 10% EC would confer damage protective effect on high-intensity eccentric contractions (80% EC) for nine different muscle groups.",
      "# Title: Protective Effect Conferred by Isometric Preconditioning Against Slow- and Fast-Velocity Eccentric Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage.\n# Abstract: We investigated if the same isometric preconditioning protocol (IPP) attenuates the magnitude of muscle damage induced by different maximal eccentric exercise protocols in the elbow flexors. Sixty-four untrained men were assigned to either two experimental or two control groups. Participants in the experimental groups performed an IPP prior to either slow (60°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-S) or fast (180°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-F) maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC). Subjects in the control groups performed slow (ECC-S) or fast (ECC-F) MaxECC without IPP. Maximal isokinetic concentric torque (MVC), muscle soreness (SOR), and muscle thickness (MT) were assessed before, immediately after, and 1-4 days following the MaxECC. Significant (p < 0.05) group vs. time interactions were found for MVC (F = 4,517), SOR (F = 6,318), and MT (F = 1,863). The ECC-S group presented faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and MT and less (p < 0.05) SOR at 96 h post-MaxECC compared with ECC-F group. No significant differences in MVC and MT were found between ECC-S and ECC-F groups following MaxECC. The ISO + ECC-S group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and SOR compared to the ECC-S group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ECC-S in any variable. The ISO + ECC-F group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of all assessed variables compared with the ECC-F group. MVC was greater (p < 0.05) at 48-72 h, and SOR was less (p < 0.05) at 48-96 h in the ISO + ECC-F compared to the ECC-F group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ISO + ECC-F for any variable. These results show that the IPP accelerated recovery of MVC and SOR for the slow-eccentric exercise condition and attenuated strength loss and SOR in addition to faster recovery of all assessed variables for the fast-eccentric exercise condition. Therefore, the IPP can be used as a strategy to attenuate and accelerate recovery of muscle damage induced by different-velocity eccentric exercises, resulting in greater protection against muscle damage induced by faster velocity."

      "conclusionA": "Eccentric exercise, performed at a submaximal intensity, currently stands out as the most effective pre-conditioning strategy for reducing Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage (EIMD); however, the magnitude of this effect is significantly moderated by participant characteristics – notably training status and sex – and the specific muscle group targeted, necessitating individualized and nuanced application of pre-conditioning protocols.",
      "conclusionB": "Performing a prior bout of low-to-moderate volume eccentric or isometric exercise—even as little as two maximal isometric contractions or 10-50 eccentric actions—significantly attenuates subsequent exercise-induced muscle damage, typically within a window of 1-2 weeks, regardless of exercise modality (downhill walking, elbow flexors, knee extensors) or contraction velocity; however, this protective effect is not sustained beyond 2-3 weeks."

We undertook a retrospective matched cohort study using a UK-based primary care database, Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum, to determine symptoms that are associated with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection beyond 12 weeks in non-hospitalized adults and the risk factors associated with developing persistent symptoms. We selected 486,149 adults with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 1,944,580 propensity score-matched adults with no recorded evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Outcomes included 115 individual symptoms, as well as long COVID, defined as a composite outcome of 33 symptoms by the World Health Organization clinical case definition. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for the outcomes. A total of 62 symptoms were significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection after 12 weeks. The largest aHRs were for anosmia (aHR 6.49, 95% CI 5.02-8.39), hair loss (3.99, 3.63-4.39), sneezing (2.77, 1.40-5.50), ejaculation difficulty (2.63, 1.61-4.28) and reduced libido (2.36, 1.61-3.47). Among the cohort of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, risk factors for long COVID included female sex, belonging to an ethnic minority, socioeconomic deprivation, smoking, obesity and a wide range of comorbidities. The risk of developing long COVID was also found to be increased along a gradient of decreasing age.

    "referenceConclusion": "Pre-conditioning significantly reduced the severity of creatine kinase release, delayed-onset muscle soreness, loss of maximal voluntary contraction force and the range of motion decrease. Pre-conditioning may prevent severe EIMD and accelerate recovery of muscle force generation capacity. The current systematic review identified that pre-conditioning activities are effective in attenuating EIMD measures, CK, muscle soreness, ROM and maximal voluntary force production. These findings suggest the use of pre-conditioning activities prior to a strenuous bout of exercise does provide a significant protective effect when performed a minimum of 24 h prior to the damaging stimulus. Furthermore, the greater improvement in MVC suggests that the pre-conditioning activities may accelerate the recovery of muscle contractile properties following strenuous exercises. However, it is unclear if pre-conditioning would prevent EIMD from more complex exercises or to what extent EIMD prevention carries over into other modes of exercise.",

      "# Title: Muscle tenderness and peak torque changes after downhill running following a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: Unaccustomed exercise (usually of an eccentric nature) is often followed by delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Previous studies have found that prior eccentric activity produces a training effect which reduces DOMS and morphological changes. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a prior bout of maximal isokinetic eccentric exercise on DOMS, strength loss and plasma creatine kinase (CK) changes following a downhill run. Ten male subjects with a mean (+/- S.D.) age of 22.5 +/- 2.8 years, body mass of 62.67 +/- 0.05 kg and height of 176 +/- 3 cm were allocated to either a treatment group or a control group. The treatment group performed 100 maximal eccentric activations of the knee extensors in the dominant leg at 0.52 rad s-1. Two weeks later, the downhill run was performed on a motor-driven treadmill. This consisted of five bouts of 8 min at a gradient of -10% at a speed corresponding to 80% of the predicted maximal heart rate. The untrained group performed the downhill run as above but without the prior isokinetic session. Tenderness measurements, plasma CK activity and concentric and eccentric isokinetic peak torque measurements of the knee extensors at 0.52 and 2.83 rad s-1 were recorded prior to, immediately following and 2, 4 and 7 days after each protocol. The isokinetic protocol caused an increase (P < 0.01) in CK and tenderness and a decrease (P < 0.05) in concentric and eccentric torque at both speeds in the treatment group. Following the downhill run, a reduction in peak torque (P < 0.01) was observed in the eccentric and concentric modes at both isokinetic speeds in the control group. For the treatment group, the decrease in peak torque occurred only at the faster eccentric speed. With the exception of the faster eccentric speed, the decrement in peak torque was greater in the control group in all post-exercise isokinetic strength tests. There was less tenderness (P < 0.01) in the trained knee extensor muscle group. Peak torque also returned to pre-downhill values earlier for the trained group. Although plasma CK activity increased in both groups after downhill running, it was much lower (P < 0.01) in the trained group. The results suggest that a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric training reduces muscle damage, reduces the amount of strength loss and decreases the sensation of DOMS after downhill running.",
      "# Title: Exercise-induced skeletal muscle damage and adaptation following repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions.\n# Abstract: Repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions were used to examine indirect indices of exercise-induced muscle damage and adaptation in human skeletal muscle. Twenty-four subjects (18 females, 6 males) aged 20.0 +/- 1.4 years (mean +/- S.D.) performed an initial bout of either 10 (n = 7), 30 (n = 9) or 50 (n = 8) maximum voluntary eccentric contractions of the knee extensors, followed by a second bout of 50 contractions 3 weeks later using the same leg. Muscle soreness was elevated after all bouts (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon test), although the initial bout reduced the soreness associated with the second bout. Force loss and a decline in the 20:100 Hz percutaneous electrical myostimulation force ratio were observed after all exercise bouts (P < 0.01). Serum creatine kinase activity was elevated following the initial bouts of 30 and 50 repetitions (P < 0.01), but there was no increase following 10 repetitions. No increase in serum creatine kinase activity was observed in any group following the second bout of contractions (P > 0.05). We conclude that skeletal muscle adaptation can be brought about by a single bout of relatively few eccentric muscle contractions. Increasing the number of eccentric muscle repetitions did not result in an increased prophylactic effect on skeletal muscle.",
      "# Title: Influence of previous concentric exercise on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether a fatiguing concentric exercise performed immediately before eccentric exercise would exacerbate eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. One arm of nine female subjects (mean +/- s: 23.3 +/- 6.7 years) performed 12 maximal eccentric actions of the elbow flexors (ECC), and the other arm performed 100 repetitions of isokinetic concentric actions of the elbow flexors followed by the same eccentric exercise (CON-ECC). The two exercise regimens (ECC and CON-ECC) were separated by 2 weeks and presented in a counterbalanced order. Changes in muscle soreness level, maximal isometric force generation, relaxed and flexed elbow joint angle, upper arm circumference and plasma creatine kinase activity were compared between the ECC and CON-ECC conditions. All measures changed significantly after both ECC and CON-ECC; however, there were significant differences in the changes between the conditions. A lower level of soreness, a faster recovery of maximal isometric force generation, a smaller decrease in relaxed elbow joint angle and a smaller increase in upper arm circumference and creatine kinase activity were evident after the CON-ECC condition compared to the ECC condition. Thus, it would seem that muscle damage was attenuated by performance of previous concentric exercise. An additional experiment using a different group of subjects (n = 5) showed that warm-up exercise before the eccentric exercise also attenuated eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.",

      "# Title: The repeated bout effect of reduced-load eccentric exercise on elbow flexor muscle damage.\n# Abstract: In this study we investigated the extent to which an initial eccentric exercise consisting of two (2ECC) or six maximal eccentric actions (6ECC) of the elbow flexors would produce a similar effect to 24 maximal eccentric actions (24ECC), on a second bout of 24ECC performed 2 weeks later. Male students (n = 34) were assigned to one of three groups, and with their non-dominant arm performed either 2ECC (n = 12), 6ECC (n = 10), or 24ECC (n = 12) as a first bout of exercise. Two weeks later all groups performed 24ECC. Maximal isometric strength, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration were assessed before, immediately after, and for 4 days after exercise. Changes in all variables were compared between the bouts and groups by a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance. All variables changed significantly (P< 0.05) after 2ECC, 6ECC, and 24ECC, but the amount of change after 2ECC and 6ECC was significantly smaller (P<0.05) than both 6ECC and 24ECC, and 24ECC, respectively. After the second bout, the 6ECC and 24ECC groups showed a profound repeated bout effect, and no significant differences were found between the groups. All variables except muscle soreness were significantly (P< 0.05) larger after the second bout for the 2ECC group, however the changes observed after 24ECC were significantly smaller (P < 0.01) than those observed after the first 24ECC of the 24ECC group. These results suggest that it is not necessary to conduct a high number of eccentric actions in the first bout to elicit a repeated bout effect in a subsequent bout performed some time later.",

      "# Title: Intensity of eccentric exercise, shift of optimum angle, and the magnitude of repeated-bout effect.\n# Abstract: This study compared the effect of four different intensities of initial eccentric exercise (ECC1) on optimum angle shift and extent of muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise. Fifty-two male students were placed into 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% groups (n = 13 per group), performing 30 eccentric actions of the elbow flexors of 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% of maximal isometric strength [maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)] for ECC1, followed 2-3 wk later by a similar exercise (ECC2) that used 100% MVC load. MVC at six elbow joint angles, range of motion, upper arm circumference, serum creatine kinase activity, myoglobin concentration, and muscle soreness were measured before and for 5 days following ECC1 and ECC2. A rightward shift of optimum angle following ECC1 was significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 100% and 80% than for the 60% and 40% groups, and it decreased significantly (P < 0.05) from immediately to 5 days postexercise. By the time ECC2 was performed, only the 100% group kept a significant shift (4 degrees). Changes in most of the criterion measures following ECC1 were significantly greater for the 100% and 80% groups compared with the 60% and 40% groups. Changes in the criterion measures following ECC2 were significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 40% group compared with other groups. Although the magnitude of repeated bout effect following ECC2 was significantly (P < 0.05) smaller for the 40% and 60% groups, all groups showed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced changes in criterion measures following ECC2 compared with the ECC1 100% bout. We conclude that the repeated-bout effect was not dependent on the shift of optimum angle.",
      "# Title: Repeated bout effect after maximal eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: We hypothesized that a bout of high or low volume eccentric exercise would protect against muscle damage following a subsequent high volume bout and that adaptation would be attributable to neural changes, independent of the initial exercise volume. Sixteen males performed either 45 (ECC45) or 10 (ECC10) maximal eccentric contractions using the elbow flexors, followed by an ECC45 bout 2 weeks later. Damage markers were measured for the following 96 h; EMG and work done during the first 10 eccentric contractions were also recorded. CK, soreness, and decrements in MVC and range of motion (ROM) were greater in bout 1 than bout 2 (p < 0.01). Soreness, MVC and ROM were greater after the initial ECC45 bout compared to the initial ECC10 bout and the repeated bouts of ECC45 exercise in both groups (p < 0.01). Median frequency decreased from bout 1 to bout 2 (p < 0.001), no differences between groups were observed. An ECC45 bout of maximal eccentric exercise causes more initial damage than an ECC10 bout of maximal eccentric exercise, although both confer protection from subsequent ECC45 bouts of maximal eccentric contractions, which are attributable, at least in part, to a shift in the frequency content of EMG.",
      "# Title: A light load eccentric exercise confers protection against a subsequent bout of more demanding eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that a light eccentric exercise (ECC) that does not induce a loss of muscle function and delayed onset muscle soreness would confer a protective effect against a more strenuous ECC. Eighteen young men were randomly placed into two groups: 10-40% (n=9) and 40% (n=9). Subjects in the 10-40% group performed ECC of the elbow flexors (six sets of five reps) using a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (MVC) at an elbow joint angle of 90 degrees , followed 2 days later by ECC using a dumbbell weight of 40% MVC. Subjects in the 40% group performed the 40% ECC only. Changes in MVC, range of motion (ROM), upper arm circumference (CIR), plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and muscle soreness before, immediately after, 1-5 and 7 days following the 40% ECC were compared between groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any of the criterion measures were found immediately and 1-2 days after the 10% ECC. Following the 40% ECC, the 10-40% group showed significantly (P<0.05) smaller decreases in MVC and ROM, and smaller increases in muscle soreness compared with the 40% group, but no significant differences between groups were evident for CIR and plasma CK activity. These results suggest that the 10% ECC induced some protection against a subsequent bout of 40% ECC performed 2 days later. It appears that the light eccentric exercise preconditioned the muscles for exposure to the subsequent damaging eccentric exercise bout.",
      "# Title: Protection against muscle damage following fifty drop jumps conferred by ten drop jumps.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether 10 drop jumps (DJs) would confer protective effect against muscle damage and soreness in a subsequent bout of 50 DJs. Sixteen men were randomly placed into either a group performing 1 set of 10 DJs followed by 5 sets of 10 DJs (10-50, n = 8) or another group performing 2 bouts of 5 sets of 10 DJs (50-50, n = 8) separated by 2 weeks. The DJs were performed from a box height of 0.6 m, with a 10-second interval between jumps and a 1-minute rest between sets. Jump height, peak vertical ground reaction force, ground contact time, and heart rate during DJs were measured, and blood lactate concentration was assessed before and immediately after DJs. Changes in maximal isometric (ISO) and isokinetic concentric torque (CON), vertical jump, muscle soreness, and plasma creatine kinase activity before, immediately after, and at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours following exercise were compared between groups for the first and second bouts and between the bouts by a 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance. Changes in ISO, CON, vertical jump, and muscle soreness were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller for 10 DJs compared with 50 DJs; however, no significant differences in the measures between groups were evident following the second bout. The changes in the measures following 50 DJs in the 10-50 group were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller than those following the first bout of the 50-50 group.

Untrained men (21.3 ± 1.6 years) were allocated into either a control or one of four repeated bout groups (n = 13 per group). The repeated bout groups performed 30 low-intensity eccentric contractions (ECC) of the elbow flexors with a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (10%-ECC) either 2 days, 7 days (1 week), 14 days (2 weeks) or 21 days (3 weeks) before 30 maximal eccentric contractions (Max-ECC). The control group performed Max-ECC only. Changes in maximal voluntary contraction strength, optimum angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following 10%-ECC were analysed by a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Changes in the variables following Max-ECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. The 10%-ECC did not change any variables, showing no indication of muscle damage. The changes in all variables following Max-ECC were smaller (P < 0.05) for 2-day, 1- and 2-week groups than control group, without significant differences between 2-day and 1-week groups. The 2-week group showed greater (P < 0.05) changes in all variables compared with 2-day and 1-week groups. Changes in the variables were similar between 3-week and control groups, except for muscle soreness showing smaller (P < 0.05) changes for 3-week group. These results suggest that non-damaging eccentric exercise confers a protective effect against Max-Ecc, but the effect is attenuated between 1 and 2 weeks.",
      "# Title: Two maximal isometric contractions attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVC-ISO) would attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. Young untrained men were placed into one of the two experimental groups or one control group (n = 13 per group). Subjects in the experimental groups performed either two or 10 MVC-ISO of the elbow flexors at a long muscle length (20° flexion) 2 days prior to 30 maximal isokinetic eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors. Subjects in the control group performed the eccentric contractions without MVC-ISO. No significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction peak torque, peak torque angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and myoglobin concentration, muscle soreness, and ultrasound echo intensity were evident after MVC-ISO. Changes in the variables following eccentric contractions were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2 MVC-ISO group (e.g., peak torque loss at 5 days after exercise, 23% ± 3%; peak CK activity, 1964 ± 452 IU·L(-1); peak muscle soreness, 46 ± 4 mm) or the 10 MVC-ISO group (13% ± 3%, 877 ± 198 IU·L(-1), 30 ± 4 mm) compared with the control (34% ± 4%, 6192 ± 1747 IU·L(-1), 66 ± 5 mm). The 10 MVC-ISO group showed smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following eccentric contractions compared with the 2 MVC-ISO group. Therefore, two MVC-ISO conferred potent protective effects against muscle damage, whereas greater protective effect was induced by 10 MVC-ISO, which can be used as a strategy to minimize muscle damage.",

      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions attenuate muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise of the knee extensors in the elderly.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors would attenuate the magnitude of muscle damage induced by maximal eccentric exercise of the same muscle performed 7 days later using elderly individuals. Healthy older men (66.4 ± 4.6 years) were assigned to control or experimental (Exp) group (n = 13 per group). The control group performed six sets of ten maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC) of the knee extensors of non-dominant leg. The Exp group performed six sets of ten low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors on a leg extension machine by lowering a weight of 10 % maximal voluntary isometric knee extension strength (10 %ECC) 7 days prior to MaxECC. Changes in maximal voluntary isokinetic concentric torque (MVC-CON), angle at peak torque, range of motion (ROM), upper thigh circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin (Mb) concentration and B-mode ultrasound echo-intensity before and for 5 days after MaxECC were compared between groups by a mixed factor ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were observed following 10 %ECC. Following MaxECC, all variables changed significantly, and changes in all variables except for angle at peak torque were significantly different between groups. MVC-CON and ROM decreased smaller and recovered faster (P < 0.05) for Exp than control group, and changes in other variables were smaller (P < 0.05) for Exp group compared with control group. These results suggest that preconditioning knee extensor muscles with low-intensity eccentric contractions was effective for attenuating muscle damage induced by subsequent MaxECC of the knee extensors for elderly individuals.",
      "# Title: Effect of two maximal isometric contractions on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the elbow flexors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the time wise protective effect conferred by two maximal voluntary isometric contractions (2MVCs) at 20° elbow flexion on muscle damage induced by 30 maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors (MaxECC). Sixty-five young untrained men were randomly assigned to a control group that did not perform 2MVCs, or one of four experimental groups (n = 13 per group) who performed 2MVCs either immediately (0d), 2 (2d), 4 (4d) or 7 days (7d) before MaxECC. Changes in maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) concentric torque (MVC-CON), optimum angle (OA), range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following MaxECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were evident following 2MVCs. The 2d and 4d groups showed 16-62 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following MaxECC than the control, 0d and 7d groups. The 2d group showed 14-34 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables except for OA compared with the 4d group. The changes in the variables were similar among the control, 0d and 7d groups. These results show that 2MVCs that were performed between 2 and 4 days before MaxECC attenuated the magnitude of muscle damage, but no such effect was evident if the 2MVCs were performed immediately or 7 days before MaxECC. It is concluded that the protective effect conferred by 2MVCs is relatively short-lived, and there is a window for the effect to be conferred.",
      "# Title: Effect of a prior bout of preconditioning exercise on muscle damage from downhill walking.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether reduced-duration downhill walking (DW) would confer a protective effect against muscle damage induced by a subsequent bout of longer duration DW performed 1 week or 4 weeks later. Healthy young adults were allocated to a control or one of the preconditioning exercise (PRE-1wk or PRE-4wk) groups (10 men and 4 women per group). PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups performed 20-min DW (-28% slope, 5 km/h, 10% body mass added to a backpack) 1 week and 4 weeks before 40-min DW, respectively, and the control group performed 40-min DW only. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) knee extension torque, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity, and muscle soreness (100-mm visual analog scale) were measured before, immediately after, and 24, 48, and 72 h after DW, and the changes in these variables were compared among groups. The control group showed symptoms of muscle damage (e.g., prolonged decrease in MVC: -14% ± 10% at 48 h post-DW) after 40-min DW. Changes in all variables after 40-min DW of PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups were 54%-61% smaller (P < 0.05) than the control group, without significant differences between PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups for MVC and plasma CK activity. Importantly, changes after the preconditioning exercise (20-min DW) were 67%-69% smaller (P < 0.05) than those after the 40-min DW of the control group. These findings suggest that 20-min DW resulting in minor muscle damage conferred a protective effect against subsequent 40-min DW, and its effect could last for more than 4 weeks.",

      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors and flexors protect against muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the magnitude and duration of the protective effect of low-intensity eccentric contractions (LowEC) against damage induced by maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) of the knee flexors (KF) and extensors (KE). Young men were assigned to 8 experimental groups and 2 control groups (n = 13/group); the experimental groups performed LowEC of KF or KE 2 days (2d), 1 week (1wk), 2 weeks (2wk), or 3 weeks (3wk) before MaxEC, while the control groups performed MaxEC of KF or KE without LowEC. The 2d, 1wk, 2wk, and 3wk groups performed 30 LowEC of KF or 60 LowEC of KE with a load of 10% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction strength on a resistance-training machine, and all groups performed 30 MaxEC of KF or 60 MaxEC of KE on an isokinetic dynamometer. Several muscle damage markers were measured from before to 2 days after exercise (LowEC) or from before to 5 days after exercise (MaxEC). No significant changes in any variables were evident after LowEC. The changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2d and 1wk groups (e.g., peak creatine kinase activity: 1002 ± 501 IU/L; peak muscle soreness: 13 ± 5 mm) than for the control group (peak creatine kinase activity: 3005 ± 983 IU/L; peak muscle soreness 28 ± 6 mm) for both KE and KF. There were no significant differences between the 2d and 1wk groups or among the 2wk, 3wk, and control groups. These results show that LowEC provided 30%-66% protection against damage induced by MaxEC of KF and KE, and the protective effect lasted 1 week.",
      "# Title: Protective effect by maximal isometric contractions against maximal eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the knee extensors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) performed before maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) would attenuate muscle damage of the knee extensors.

Small but significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction torque, range of motion (ROM) and plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity were evident at immediately to 2 days post-MVIC (p < 0.05), but other variables (e.g. thigh girth, myoglobin concentration, B-mode echo intensity) did not change significantly. Changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (p < 0.05) by 45% (soreness)-67% (CK) for the experimental than the control group.

      "# Title: Prevention of downhill walking-induced muscle damage by non-damaging downhill walking.\n# Abstract: Mountain trekking involves level, uphill, and downhill walking (DW). Prolonged DW induces damage to leg muscles, reducing force generating ability and muscle coordination. These increase risks for more serious injuries and accidents in mountain trekking, thus a strategy to minimize muscle damage is warranted. It has been shown that low-intensity eccentric contractions confer protective effect on muscle damage induced by high-intensity eccentric contractions. This study tested the hypothesis that 5-min non-damaging DW would attenuate muscle damage induced by 40-min DW, but 5-min level walking (LW) would not.",
      "# Title: Isometric pre-conditioning blunts exercise-induced muscle damage but does not attenuate changes in running economy following downhill running.\n# Abstract: Running economy (RE) is impaired following unaccustomed eccentric-biased exercises that induce muscle damage. It is also known that muscle damage is reduced when maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) are performed at a long muscle length 2-4 days prior to maximal eccentric exercise with the same muscle, a phenomenon that can be described as isometric pre-conditioning (IPC). We tested the hypothesis that IPC could attenuate muscle damage and changes in RE following downhill running. Thirty untrained men were randomly assigned into experimental or control groups and ran downhill on a treadmill (-15%) for 30 min. Participants in the experimental group completed 10 MVIC in a leg press machine two days prior to downhill running, while participants in the control group did not perform IPC. The magnitude of changes in muscle soreness determined 48 h after downhill running was greater for the control group (122 ± 28 mm) than for the experimental group (92 ± 38 mm). Isometric peak torque recovered faster in the experimental group compared with the control group (3 days vs. no full recovery, respectively). No significant effect of IPC was found for countermovement jump height, serum creatine kinase activity or any parameters associated with RE. These results supported the hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in markers of muscle damage. The hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in RE was not supported by our data. It appears that the mechanisms involved in changes in markers of muscle damage and parameters associated with RE following downhill running are not completely shared.",

      "# Title: Protective Effect Conferred by Isometric Preconditioning Against Slow- and Fast-Velocity Eccentric Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage.\n# Abstract: We investigated if the same isometric preconditioning protocol (IPP) attenuates the magnitude of muscle damage induced by different maximal eccentric exercise protocols in the elbow flexors. Sixty-four untrained men were assigned to either two experimental or two control groups. Participants in the experimental groups performed an IPP prior to either slow (60°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-S) or fast (180°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-F) maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC). Subjects in the control groups performed slow (ECC-S) or fast (ECC-F) MaxECC without IPP. Maximal isokinetic concentric torque (MVC), muscle soreness (SOR), and muscle thickness (MT) were assessed before, immediately after, and 1-4 days following the MaxECC. Significant (p < 0.05) group vs. time interactions were found for MVC (F = 4,517), SOR (F = 6,318), and MT (F = 1,863). The ECC-S group presented faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and MT and less (p < 0.05) SOR at 96 h post-MaxECC compared with ECC-F group. No significant differences in MVC and MT were found between ECC-S and ECC-F groups following MaxECC. The ISO + ECC-S group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and SOR compared to the ECC-S group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ECC-S in any variable. The ISO + ECC-F group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of all assessed variables compared with the ECC-F group. MVC was greater (p < 0.05) at 48-72 h, and SOR was less (p < 0.05) at 48-96 h in the ISO + ECC-F compared to the ECC-F group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ISO + ECC-F for any variable. These results show that the IPP accelerated recovery of MVC and SOR for the slow-eccentric exercise condition and attenuated strength loss and SOR in addition to faster recovery of all assessed variables for the fast-eccentric exercise condition. Therefore, the IPP can be used as a strategy to attenuate and accelerate recovery of muscle damage induced by different-velocity eccentric exercises, resulting in greater protection against muscle damage induced by faster velocity."

A total of 80 patients with acute cerebral infarction who were treated at our hospital were randomly selected. They were divided into groups A and B. The two groups were treated with intravenous thrombolysis, while group B received sub-hypothermia treatment. Prior to treatment and at 7 days after treatment, 5 ml of venous blood was collected and stored in a freezer at -80˚C. IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 levels were detected by ELISA and compared between the groups and time-points. The results were as follows: i) At 7 days after treatment, the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in group B were significantly decreased compared with those in group A (P<0.05), while there was no significant difference of these levels between group A and B before treatment (P>0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions in group A and group B was 35 and 20% respectively, and the mortality rate was 10 and 5%, respectively. There were no significant differences in adverse events and mortality between the two groups (P>0.05). In addition, a positive correlation of the level of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was determined in the patients prior to treatment.

Our study evaluates the safety of appendectomy performed with SDD in pediatric patients when compared to appendectomy followed by an overnight stay, using a large nationwide database and a strict definition of SDD by using hospital length of stay (LOS). Methods: Using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric (NSQIP-P) registry, we identified patients younger than 18 years of age who underwent outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy, with SDD (n = 2647) or overnight stay (n = 5045). One-to-one propensity score matching was performed to compare 30-day readmission rates and postsurgical complications. Results: Non-Hispanic black race was associated with a higher likelihood of overnight stay after laparoscopic appendectomy. In the propensity score-matched analysis (N = 2443 pairs), SDD was not associated with an increased risk of 30-day unplanned readmission (odds ratio [OR] = 0.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.6-1.4; P = .667) or any 30-day complication (OR = 0.8, 95% CI: 0.6-1.1; P = .258). Conclusion: SDD after laparoscopic appendectomy in pediatric patients was not associated with an increased risk of 30-day hospital admission or complication rate.

Our objective was to determine if mFI predicts morbidity and mortality in the diverse national cohort of patients undergoing neurosurgery for intracranial neoplasms. We identified patients in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program who underwent oncologic neurosurgery procedures between 2008 and 2012. The mFI, ranging from 0 to 1, was calculated as the proportion of 11 possible risk factors present. We assessed the associations between mFI and 30-day mortality, neurologic and medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge in univariate and multivariable analyses and compare the index to established risk stratification techniques. A total of 9149 patients were identified. Mortality, severe medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge increased incrementally with increasing levels of frailty. Severe neurologic complications were highest in those with low frailty. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, increased frailty increased the odds of all adverse outcomes, including neurologic complications. The mFI increased the ability to predict all outcomes beyond available indices and was the most reliable predictor of neurologic complications. The mFI can be calculated from routinely collected medical record data and is predictive of 30-day adverse outcomes in a wide variety of neurosurgical oncology patients. The index may be a useful component of preoperative risk assessment with implications for shared decision-making, perioperative planning, and risk adjusted outcomes measurement in national quality registries.",

Few data exist regarding the relationship of frailty with adverse outcomes in craniotomy for brain tumor resection. We assessed the relationship between frailty and the incidence of major post-operative complication, discharge destination other than home, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality after elective craniotomy for brain tumor resection. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 20,333 adult patients undergoing elective craniotomy for tumor resection in the 2012-2018 ACS-NSQIP Participant Use File. Multivariate logistic regression was performed using all covariates deemed eligible through clinical and statistical significance. 6,249 patients (30.7%) were low-frailty and 2,148 patients (10.6%) were medium-to-high frailty. In multivariate logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, BMI, ASA classification, smoking status, dyspnea, significant pre-operative weight loss, chronic steroid use, bleeding disorder, tumor type, and operative time, low frailty was associated with increased adjusted odds ratio of major complication (1.41, 95% CI: 1.23-1.60, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.32, 95% CI: 1.20-1.46, p < 0.001), 30-day readmission (1.29, 95% CI: 1.15-1.44, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (1.87, 95% CI: 1.41-2.47, p < 0.001). Moderate-to-high frailty was also associated with increased adjusted odds of major complication (1.61, 95% CI: 1.35-1.92, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.80, 95% CI: 1.58-2.05), 30-day readmission (1.39, 95% CI: 1.19-1.62, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (2.42, 95% CI: 1.74-3.38, p < 0.001).

    "referenceConclusion": "The evidence is robust for a strongly elevated risk of tuberculosis with radiological silicosis, with a low disease severity threshold. The effect estimate is more uncertain for silica exposure without radiological silicosis. Research is needed, particularly cohort studies measuring silica exposure in different settings, to characterise the effect more accurately as well as the silica exposure threshold that could be used to prevent excess tuberculosis risk. The study provides to our knowledge the first systematic review of the epidemiological evidence for an association identified at least a century ago, viz. that occupational inhalation of silica dust increases the risk of pulmonary tuberculosis in co-exposed populations. In the current era, even with less severe forms of silicosis in traditional dusty industries, the evidence remains strong for a substantially elevated risk of tuberculosis in those with radiologically diagnosed disease. While there is evidence for an elevated risk of tuberculosis in those who have not been radiologically diagnosed with silicosis, the effect size is subject to uncertainty. Further studies are needed to characterise this effect, and particularly the exposure threshold that would avoid an excess risk of tuberculosis.",

Two occupational categories were extracted--\"mining, tunneling, and quarrying\" (n = 284) and \"iron and steel foundries\" (n = 428), respectively. Control groups were drawn from a national register of persons undergoing periodic health examinations with regard to silicosis risk. The controls were matched for occupation, age, and time of first exposure. The follow-up was performed through record-linkage operations to computerized information in Swedish Death Statistics, Swedish Cancer Register, and the Swedish Tuberculosis Index. End of follow-up was set at December 31, 1980. In cases drawn from mining, quarrying, and tunneling workers seven deaths in lung cancer were observed and two among the controls. Among iron and steel foundry workers the corresponding numbers were 10 and 6. The values for expected numbers, based on general population statistics, were 1.3 and 2.6, respectively, for these two occupational groups. When cancer incidence statistics were used, the case/control ratio for lung cancer was 2.1 for \"mining, quarrying, and tunneling\" and 0.6 for \"iron and steel foundries.\" There were 29 cases of lung tuberculosis registered among the silicosis cases during the follow-up period. Only one tuberculosis case was observed among the controls. The results demonstrate that persons with silicosis contracted in the mining, quarrying, and tunneling occupations are subject to an increased risk of lung cancer. The risk is observed when both the general population and a closely matched control population from the same occupations are used for values of reference. The results also demonstrate the high risk of persons with silicosis to contract lung tuberculosis.",

In this study, a cohort of 1,153 older gold miners with and without silicosis who had not had tuberculosis have been followed for 7 yr by a routine mine surveillance program for detection of tuberculosis. One hundred seventy-eight of the men developed tuberculosis. The annual incidence of tuberculosis was 981/100,000 in the 335 men without silicosis and 2,707/100,000 in the 818 men with silicosis. The relative risk for tuberculosis was 2.8 (95% CI, 1.9 to 4.1) for men with silicosis compared with that in the men without silicosis. The incidence of tuberculosis increased from 1% per annum (pa) for the men without silicosis to 2.2% pa for the men with silicosis with Category 1 nodule profusion, 2.9% pa for those with Category 2, and 6.3% pa for those with Category 3 silicosis. This study has confirmed and quantified the high risk of pulmonary and of extrapulmonary tuberculosis in men with silicosis.

Risk factors for nontuberculous pulmonary mycobacterial (NTM) disease and tuberculosis (TB) in gold miners were identified in a retrospective case-control study that included 206 NTM patients and 381 TB patients of known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status diagnosed between 1993 and 1996. A total of 180 HIV-tested trauma/surgical inpatients were selected as control patients. Both HIV infection (odds ratio [OR] 3.6 for NTM and 4.5 for TB patients) and higher grades of silicosis (OR 5.0 for NTM and 4.9 for TB patients) were significantly more common in NTM and TB patients than in control patients. HIV prevalence rose in the control and both case groups during the study period. The overall HIV prevalence was 13.1% in NTM patients, 14.2% in TB patients, and 5.6% in control patients. Previous TB (OR 9.6), premorbid focal radiological scarring (OR 7.4) and a dusty job at diagnosis (OR 2.4) were additional significant risk factors for NTM disease. These findings suggest that the historically high incidence of NTM disease in miners is largely attributable to chronic chest disease from silica dust inhalation and prior TB. HIV infection has recently become an additional risk factor for mycobacterial disease in miners and is likely to become increasingly important as the HIV epidemic progresses.",

The risk of MTB infection relative to the general population was 4.5. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the independent risk factors for MTB infection in ESRD patients are old age (hazard ratio (HR) 1.17 per 10 years, p <0.001), male gender (HR 1.37, p <0.001), silicosis (HR 5.82, p <0.001), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 1.68, p 0.012).

The aim was to understand the impact of endometriosis on implantation, pregnancy and live birth rates in menopausal recipients. A total of 240 menopausal recipients of donated sibling oocytes, were divided in two groups. Group I consisted of 120 recipients diagnosed with endometriosis and group II consisted of 120 controls.

In oocyte donation cycles, a recipient's history of endometriosis might have a negative impact on implantation, pregnancy and live birth rates, even in menopausal women. Infertility in endometriosis may be due to poor oocyte quality or embryos with decreased ability to implant due to impaired fertilization.

Our findings suggest a potential minimal decrease in the LBR among recipients with a history of endometriosis undergoing oocyte donation ART cycles. Because this approach can provide insights into the impact of the condition on the process of embryo implantation, we can deduce that a marginal impairment of uterine receptivity contributes to infertility mechanisms in women affected by endometriosis. Whether this defect is associated with comorbidities or confounders have to be clarified in future studies.",

In order to eliminate these confounding effects, this prospective comparative study studied a population of menopausal recipients with and without endometriosis sharing sibling oocytes coming from the same donor. The aim was to understand the impact of endometriosis on implantation, pregnancy and live birth rates in menopausal recipients. A total of 240 menopausal recipients of donated sibling oocytes, were divided in two groups. Group I consisted of 120 recipients diagnosed with endometriosis and group II consisted of 120 controls. The implantation and pregnancy rates were significantly lower in the endometriosis group compared with the control group (23.81% versus 31.48%, P=0.019; 45.00% versus 58.33%, P=0.039, respectively). In oocyte donation cycles, a recipient's history of endometriosis might have a negative impact on implantation, pregnancy and live birth rates, even in menopausal women. Infertility in endometriosis may be due to poor oocyte quality or embryos with decreased ability to implant due to impaired fertilization. There are no conclusive data on the impact of endometriosis on implantation. The already-known adverse effect of endometriosis on gamete quality makes it more difficult to demonstrate a direct effect of endometriosis on implantation. In order to eliminate these confounding effects we studied a population of menopausal recipients with and without endometriosis sharing sibling oocytes coming from the same oocyte donor. The oocyte donation model was used in an attempt to understand whether the endometrium, the oocytes or both are affected by endometriosis. The aim of the present study was to understand the impact of endometriosis on implantation, pregnancy and live birth rates in menopausal recipients. A total of 240 menopausal recipients of donated sibling oocytes were divided into two groups. Group I consisted of 120 recipients diagnosed with endometriosis and group II consisted of 120 controls. The pregnancy and implantation rates were significantly lower in the endometriosis group compared to the control group (45.00% versus 58.33%, P=0.039) and (23.81% versus 31.48%, P=0.019) respectively.

      "# Title: Iron overload in cirrhosis-HFE genotypes and outcome after liver transplantation.\n# Abstract: Previously, we found appreciable hepatic iron deposition in one third of our patients undergoing liver transplantation (LTx) with approximately 10% of cases having quantifiable iron in the range of that seen in hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC). The aim of this study was to compare clinical outcome in liver transplant patients with and without iron overload. We also sought to determine the prevalence of HFE mutations in liver transplant patients with iron overload. Of 456 consecutive liver transplants, 41 explants had an hepatic iron index (HII) greater than 1.9, and these cases were compared to 41 matched liver transplant recipients without increased hepatic iron. Posttransplantation complications, along with patient and graft survival were monitored. HFE gene testing was performed using DNA-based techniques. Kaplan-Meier 5-year patient survival after LTx was significantly lower in cases with hepatic iron overload compared to matched controls without iron excess (48% vs. 77%; P =.045). Fatal infections (especially fungal) were more common in patients with iron overload (24% vs. 7%; P =.03). Of the 41 patients with a liver explant HII greater than 1.9, only 4 were C282Y homozygotes. Patients with severe hepatic explant iron overload undergoing LTx have a reduced survival compared to liver transplant recipients without explant iron excess. The reduced survival was attributable mainly to fatal bacterial and fungal infections. Despite the iron overload, HFE gene mutations were uncommon in patients with hepatic explant hemosiderosis.",
      "# Title: Association of hepatic iron overload with invasive fungal infection in liver transplant recipients.\n# Abstract: Invasive fungal infection is a serious complication of orthotopic liver transplantation, but its risk factors remain incompletely defined. Iron overload has already been associated with increased risk of fungal infections, but it has not yet been assessed as a risk factor in liver transplantation. We retrospectively studied a cohort of 153 consecutive patients who underwent their first liver transplantation at a single center and who survived at least 7 days after transplantation. The association between various pretransplant patient characteristics, including hepatic explant iron and risk of invasive fungal infections, was analyzed by univariate and multivariate models. Iron in the hepatic explant was assessed by Perl's Prussian blue stain by a pathologist blinded to clinical outcome. During the first year after transplantation, 28 of 153 patients developed a total of 31 invasive fungal infections, of which 21 (68%) were caused by Candida, 7 (23%) by Aspergillus, 2 (6%) by Cryptococcus, and 1 (3%) by Saccharomyces. Stainable iron in the hepatic explant was found in 48 patients (31%). Stainable iron in the hepatic explant was found to be strongly and independently associated with posttransplantation fungal infections in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 3.09; 95% confidence interval 1.45-6.56; P = 0.003). Hepatic iron overload is strongly and independently associated with posttransplantation invasive fungal infections. Studies to confirm this finding in other centers and define the mechanism are warranted.",
      "# Title: Serum ferritin concentration predicts mortality in patients awaiting liver transplantation.\n# Abstract: Additional markers are required to identify patients on the orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) waiting list at increased risk of death and adverse clinical events. Serum ferritin concentration is a marker of varied pathophysiological events and is elevated with increased liver iron concentration, hepatic necroinflammation, and systemic illness, all of which may cause a deterioration in liver function and clinical status. The aim of this study was to determine whether serum ferritin concentration is an independent prognostic factor in subjects awaiting OLT. This is a dual-center retrospective study. The study cohort consisted of 191 consecutive adults with cirrhosis accepted by the Queensland (Australia) Liver Transplant Service between January 2000 and June 2006 and a validation cohort of 131 patients from University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Transplant Center. In the study cohort, baseline serum ferritin greater than 200 microg/L was an independent factor predicting increased 180-day and 1-year waiting list mortality. This effect was independent of model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), hepatocellular carcinoma, age, and sex. Subjects with higher serum ferritin had increased frequency of liver-related clinical events. The relationship between serum ferritin and waiting list mortality was confirmed in the UCLA cohort; all deceased patients had serum ferritin greater than 400 microg/L. Serum ferritin greater than 500 microg/L and MELD were independent risk factors for death.",

      "# Title: Serum ferritin concentration and transferrin saturation before liver transplantation predict decreased long-term recipient survival.\n# Abstract: Serum ferritin (SF) concentration is a widely available parameter used to assess iron homeostasis. It has been described as a marker to identify high-risk patients awaiting liver transplantation (LT) but is also elevated in systemic immune-mediated diseases, metabolic syndrome, and in hemodialysis where it is associated with an inferior prognosis. This study analyzed whether SF is not only a predictor of liver-related mortality prior to LT but also an independent marker of survival following LT. In a dual-center, retrospective study, a cohort of 328 consecutive first-LT patients from Hannover Medical School, Germany (2003-2008, follow-up 1260 days), and 82 consecutive LT patients from Regensburg University Hospital, Germany (2003-2007, follow-up 1355 days) as validation cohort were analyzed. In patients exhibiting SF ≥365 μg/L versus <365 μg/L prior to LT, 1-, 3-, and 5-year post-LT survival was 73.3% versus 81.1%, 64.4% versus 77.3%, and 61.1% versus 74.4%, respectively (overall survival P = 0.0097), which was confirmed in the validation cohort (overall survival of 55% versus 83.3%, P = 0.005). Multivariate analyses identified SF ≥365 μg/L combined with transferrin saturation (TFS) <55%, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the survival after LT (SALT) score as independent risk factors for death. In patients with SF concentrations ≥365 μg/L and TFS <55%, overall survival was 54% versus 74.8% in the remaining group (P = 0.003). In the validation cohort, it was 28.6% versus 72% (P = 0.017), respectively.",
      "# Title: The association of pretransplant ferritin level with waiting list and post-transplant survival. Does ferritin actually predict outcome?\n# Abstract: Recent data suggest an association of serum ferritin (SF) with waiting list (WL) and postliver transplant (LT) outcomes. To assess the predictive capacity of SF on pre- and post-LT outcomes, and to identify whether recipient or donor liver siderosis is associated with post-LT survival; a retrospective analysis of 1079 patients assessed for first LT, 2000-2007 was performed. Iron deposition in the liver tissue was assessed using a semi-quantitative grading system. Median age was 54 (18-82) years and 67% were male. Seventeen per cent had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Median Model for End-stage Liver Disease MELD score was 14 (6-40), ferritin was 174 μg/l (4-4597) with 36.5% had a SF ≥ μg/l. Age (OR = 1.028) and MELD score (OR = 1.158) were independently associated with WL mortality (P < 0.001), whilst SF was not (P = NS). Age (OR = 1.018), HCC (OR = 1.542) and cold ischemia time (CIT) ≥ 10 h (OR = 1.418) were independently associated with post-LT survival (P < 0.05). Explant siderosis grade <2 was seen in 376 (71.7%) patients. Patients with explant siderosis grade ≥ 2 had inferior 12-month post-LT survival (P = 0.030). Presence of graft siderosis (15.8% of patients) was not associated with survival. In conclusion, we found a limited role for SF as a prognostic indicator for pre- or post-transplant survival.",
      "# Title: Iron-related markers are associated with infection after liver transplantation.\n# Abstract: Though serum iron has been known to be associated with an increased risk of infection, hepcidin, the major regulator of iron metabolism, has never been systematically explored in this setting. Finding early biomarkers of infection, such as hepcidin, could help identify patients in whom early empiric antimicrobial therapy would be beneficial. We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients (n = 128) undergoing first-time, single-organ orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) without known iron overload disorders at 2 academic hospitals in Boston from August 2009 to November 2012. Cox regression compared the associations between different iron markers and the development of first infection at least 1 week after OLT; 47 (37%) patients developed a primary outcome of infection at least 1 week after OLT and 1 patient died. After adjusting for perioperative bleeding complications, number of hospital days, and hepatic artery thrombosis, changes in iron markers were associated with the development of infection post-OLT including increasing ferritin (hazard ratio [HR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-2.05), rising ferritin slope (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.17), and increasing hepcidin (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.05-1.93). A decreasing iron (HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.20-2.57) and a decreasing iron slope (HR, 4.21; 95% CI, 2.51-7.06) were also associated with subsequent infections. In conclusion, hepcidin and other serum iron markers and their slope patterns or their combination are associated with infection in vulnerable patient populations.

Therefore identifying factors associated with mortality could help improve patient management. The impact of iron metabolism, which could be a relevant therapeutic target, yield discrepant results in this setting. Previous studies suggest that increased serum ferritin is associated with higher mortality. Surprisingly iron deficiency which is a well described risk factor in critically ill patients has not been considered."

      "# Title: Accuracy of real-time shear wave elastography for assessing liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C: a pilot study.\n# Abstract: Real-time shear wave elastography (SWE) is a novel, noninvasive method to assess liver fibrosis by measuring liver stiffness. This single-center study was conducted to assess the accuracy of SWE in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), in comparison with transient elastography (TE), by using liver biopsy (LB) as the reference standard. Consecutive patients with CHC scheduled for LB by referring physicians were studied. One hundred and twenty-one patients met inclusion criteria. On the same day, real-time SWE using the ultrasound (US) system, Aixplorer (SuperSonic Imagine S.A., Aix-en-Provence, France), TE using FibroScan (Echosens, Paris, France), and US-assisted LB were consecutively performed. Fibrosis was staged according to the METAVIR scoring system. Analyses of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were performed to calculate optimal area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for F0-F1 versus F2-F4, F0- F2 versus F3-F4, and F0-F3 versus F4 for both real-time SWE and TE. Liver stiffness values increased in parallel with degree of liver fibrosis, both with SWE and TE. AUROCs were 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-0.96) for SWE and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.76-0.90) for TE (P = 0.002), 0.98 (95% CI: 0.94-1.00) for SWE and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.90-0.99) for TE (P = 0.14), and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.93-1.00) for SWE and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.91-0.99) for TE (P = 0.48), when comparing F0-F1 versus F2- F4, F0- F2 versus F3-F4, and F0 -F3 versus F4, respectively.",

      "# Title: Inter- and intra-operator reliability and repeatability of shear wave elastography in the liver: a study in healthy volunteers.\n# Abstract: This study assessed the reproducibility of shear wave elastography (SWE) in the liver of healthy volunteers. Intra- and inter-operator reliability and repeatability were quantified in three different liver segments in a sample of 15 subjects, scanned during four independent sessions (two scans on day 1, two scans 1 wk later) by two operators. A total of 1440 measurements were made. Reproducibility was assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and a repeated measures analysis of variance. The shear wave speed was measured and used to estimate Young's modulus using the Supersonics Imagine Aixplorer. The median Young's modulus measured through the inter-costal space was 5.55 ± 0.74 kPa. The intra-operator reliability was better for same-day evaluations (ICC = 0.91) than the inter-operator reliability (ICC = 0.78). Intra-observer agreement decreased when scans were repeated on a different day. Inter-session repeatability was between 3.3% and 9.9% for intra-day repeated scans, compared with to 6.5%-12% for inter-day repeated scans. No significant difference was observed in subjects with a body mass index greater or less than 25 kg/m(2).",

      "# Title: Automatic assessment of shear wave elastography quality and measurement reliability in the liver.\n# Abstract: A strategy is proposed that accesses the quality of individual shear wave elastography (SWE) exams and the reliability of elasticity measurements in clinical practice. For that purpose, a confidence index based on temporal stability and SWE filling was defined to provide an automatic estimation of each scan quality: high (HG) or low (LG) grade. With this index, the intra-observer acquisition variability assessed by comparing consecutive scans of the same patient was 17% and 32% for HG and LG clips, respectively. The measurement quantification variability assessed by comparing the measurements of a radiologist with those of a trained operator and of two automatic measurements on a same clip averaged 13% and 22% for HG and LG exams, respectively. It was found that SWE measurements depend greatly on the quality of the acquired data. The proposed quality index (HG or LG) provides objective input on the accuracy and diagnostic reliability of SWE measurements.",

The rate of reliable liver stiffness measurements was significantly higher with 2-D SWE than with TE: 99.2% versus 74.8%, p < 0.0001 (different reliability criteria used, according to current recommendations). In univariate analysis, liver stiffness measured with 2-D SWE correlated best with fibrosis stage estimated with TE (r = 0.699, p < 0.0001), followed by Forns score (r = 0.534, p < 0.0001) and King's score (r = 0.512, p < 0.0001). However, in multivariate analysis, only 2-D SWE-measured values remained correlated with fibrosis stage (p < 0.0001). The optimal 2-D SWE cutoff values for predicting significant fibrosis were 8.03 kPa for fibrosis stage ≥2 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.832) and 13.1 kPa for fibrosis stage 4 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.915), respectively. In conclusion, 2-D SWE can be used to obtain reliable liver stiffness measurements in almost all patients and performs very well in predicting the presence of liver cirrhosis.",
      "# Title: Assessment of liver fibrosis with 2-D shear wave elastography in comparison to transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse imaging in patients with chronic liver disease.\n# Abstract: Two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2-D SWE) is an ultrasound-based elastography method integrated into a conventional ultrasound machine. It can evaluate larger regions of interest and, therefore, might be better at determining the overall fibrosis distribution. The aim of this prospective study was to compare 2-D SWE with the two best evaluated liver elastography methods, transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse (point SWE using acoustic radiation force impulse) imaging, in the same population group. The study included 132 patients with chronic hepatopathies, in which liver stiffness was evaluated using transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging and 2-D SWE. The reference methods were liver biopsy for the assessment of liver fibrosis (n = 101) and magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography for the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis (n = 31). No significant difference in diagnostic accuracy, assessed as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), was found between the three elastography methods (2-D SWE, transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging) for the diagnosis of significant and advanced fibrosis and liver cirrhosis in the \"per protocol\" (AUROCs for fibrosis stages ≥2: 0.90, 0.95 and 0.91; for fibrosis stage [F] ≥3: 0.93, 0.95 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.92, 0.96 and 0.92) and \"intention to diagnose\" cohort (AUROCs for F ≥2: 0.87, 0.92 and 0.91; for F ≥3: 0.91, 0.93 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.88, 0.90 and 0.89). Therefore, 2-D SWE, ARFI imaging and transient elastography seem to be comparably good methods for non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis.",

      "# Title: Liver stiffness in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: A comparison of supersonic shear imaging, FibroScan, and ARFI with liver biopsy.\n# Abstract: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a major public health issue. The goal of this study was to assess the clinical use of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) evaluated by supersonic shear imaging (SSI), FibroScan, and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) in a cohort of NAFLD patients who underwent liver biopsy. A total of 291 NAFLD patients were prospectively enrolled from November 2011 to February 2015 at 2 French university hospitals. LSM was assessed by SSI, FibroScan (M probe), and ARFI within two weeks prior to liver biopsy. Calculations of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) were performed and compared for the staging of liver fibrosis. AUROC for SSI, FibroScan, and ARFI were 0.86, 0.82, and 0.77 for diagnoses of ≥F2; 0.89, 0.86, and 0.84 for ≥F3; and 0.88, 0.87, and 0.84 for F4, respectively. SSI had a higher accuracy than ARFI for diagnoses of significant fibrosis (≥F2) (P = 0.004). Clinical factors related to obesity such as body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2) , waist circumference ≥102 cm or increased parietal wall thickness were associated with LSM failures when using SSI or FibroScan and with unreliable results when using ARFI. In univariate analysis, FibroScan values were slightly correlated with NAFLD activity score and steatosis (R = 0.28 and 0.22, respectively), whereas SSI and ARFI were not; however, these components of NAFLD did not affect LSM results in multivariate analysis. The cutoff values for SSI and FibroScan for staging fibrosis with a sensitivity ≥90% were very close: 6.3/6.2 kPa for ≥F2, 8.3/8.2 kPa for ≥F3, and 10.5/9.5 kPa for F4.",

Our prospective study included 115 consecutive patients with suspected or alleged chronic hepatitis. Patients underwent SWE by two different operators and TE by sonographers on the same day. The correlation coefficient of the intra-class correlation test between an experienced radiologist and a third-year radiology resident was 0.878. There was a moderate correlation between SWE and TE (r = 0.511) in the diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis. The best cutoff values predicting significant hepatic fibrosis and liver cirrhosis by SWE were >1.78 m/s (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] = 0.777) and >2.24 m/s (AUROC = 0.935), respectively.

Patients with CHB infection who underwent liver biopsy were consecutively included. After exclusions, 257 patients were analyzed. Two-dimensional SWE resulted in a significantly higher rate of reliable measurements (98.1%, 252/257) than TE (93.0%, 239/257) (p = 0.011). Liver stiffness measurements of the two examinations exhibited a strong correlation (r = 0.835, p < 0.001). In patients given a confirmed histologic diagnosis, Spearman's rank coefficients were 0.520 in stage F0 (p < 0.001), 0.684 in stage F1 (p < 0.001), 0.777 in stage F2 (p < 0.001), 0.672 in stage F3 (p < 0.001) and 0.755 in stage F4 (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of 2-D SWE and TE for liver fibrosis staging (all p values > 0.05). Two-dimensional SWE had diagnostic accuracy comparable to that of TE for liver fibrosis staging. The measurements that the two techniques provide are not interchangeable.",

The purpose of this study was to perform an intra-individual comparison between 2-D shear wave elastography (2-D-SWE with a GE system) and Virtual Touch Tissue Quantification (VTTQ with a Siemens system) to assess whether these can be used interchangeably to grade fibrosis. Ninety-three patients (51 men, 42 women; mean age, 54 y) with liver disease of various etiologies (hepatitis B virus = 47, hepatitis C virus = 22; alcohol = 6, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis = 5, other = 13) were included. Using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values, liver fibrosis was classified into clinically non-significant (F0/F1) and significant (≥F2) fibrosis. Results indicated that intra-modality repeatability was excellent for both techniques (GE 2-D-SWE: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.89 [0.84-0.93]; VTTQ: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.90 [0.86-0.93]). Intra-modality classification agreement for fibrosis grading was good to excellent (GE 2-D-SWE: κ = 0.65, VTTQ: κ = 0.82). However, inter-modality agreement for fibrosis grading was only fair (κ = 0.31) using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values of fibrosis. In conclusion, although both GE 2-D-SWE and Siemens VTTQ exhibit good to excellent intra-modality repeatability, inter-modality agreement is only fair, suggesting that these should not be used interchangeably.",

These findings suggest that a marginal impairment of uterine receptivity may contribute to infertility mechanisms in women affected by endometriosis. Our findings suggest a potential minimal decrease in the LBR among recipients with a history of endometriosis undergoing oocyte donation ART cycles. Because this approach can provide insights into the impact of the condition on the process of embryo implantation, we can deduce that a marginal impairment of uterine receptivity contributes to infertility mechanisms in women affected by endometriosis.

The aim was to understand the impact of endometriosis on implantation, pregnancy and live birth rates in menopausal recipients. A total of 240 menopausal recipients of donated sibling oocytes, were divided in two groups. Group I consisted of 120 recipients diagnosed with endometriosis and group II consisted of 120 controls. The implantation and pregnancy rates were significantly lower in the endometriosis group compared with the control group (23.81% versus 31.48%, P=0.019; 45.00% versus 58.33%, P=0.039, respectively). In oocyte donation cycles, a recipient's history of endometriosis might have a negative impact on implantation, pregnancy and live birth rates, even in menopausal women. Infertility in endometriosis may be due to poor oocyte quality or embryos with decreased ability to implant due to impaired fertilization. There are no conclusive data on the impact of endometriosis on implantation. The already-known adverse effect of endometriosis on gamete quality makes it more difficult to demonstrate a direct effect of endometriosis on implantation. In order to eliminate these confounding effects we studied a population of menopausal recipients with and without endometriosis sharing sibling oocytes coming from the same oocyte donor.

The two most commonly used autogenous grafts are the central third of the patellar tendon and the hamstring tendon constructs. The choice of different grafts and different construct influence the final clinical outcome of ACL reconstruction. The 3 groups, of 25 patients each, were generated by choosing the technique (PT tendon, 4 strand hamstring, and single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty) to utilize and followed for 5 years, with an alternate systematic sampling. Our comparison has shown significant kneeling pain in the patellar tendon with respect to the groups with hamstrings techniques. Single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty achieved subjective score significantly higher with respect to the other two groups as well as for the time to resume sport. The study confirms that patellar tendon and hamstring can be equivalent options for ACL reconstruction. This study demonstrated that a superior outcome as far as subjective clinical findings were concerned, was obtained in group III. Patients in the latter group were also able to return to sports sooner than those in the bone-patellar tendon graft group and the four-strand hamstring group.",

The purpose of this prospective randomized study was to compare the clinical, instrumental and X-ray outcome of two ACL reconstruction techniques with hamstring tendons: one with a single intra-articular bundle associated to an extra-articular sling, the second with a more anatomic double-bundle technique that reproduces better the native ACL function. From an initial group of 100 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction, 72 patients (35 single bundle plus lateral plasty and 37 double bundle) were evaluated with IKDC, Tegner score, KT2000 arthrometer, Activity Rating Scale, Psychovitality Questionnaire and Ahlback radiographic score at a mean 3 years follow-up. Double-bundle group showed significantly better results regarding IKDC, ROM, Activity Rating Scale and time to return to sport. Also KT 2000 showed significant differences in objective stability. The double-bundle technique for ACL reconstruction described in this paper has demonstrated significantly better subjective, objective and functional results compared with a double-stranded hamstrings plus extra-articular sling at a minimum 3-year follow-up.",

      "# Title: A medium to long-term follow-up of ACL reconstruction using double gracilis and semitendinosus grafts.\n# Abstract: This paper reports the results of our approach to ACL tears and knee laxity, based on 30 years of experience in ACL reconstruction with hamstrings and founded on the following cornerstones: the use of doubled semitendinosus and gracilis as a free graft; the use of an out-in technique for femoral drilling and of very strong and stiff fixation devices; the careful examination and repair or reconstruction of the lateral compartment in selected patients; and the use of unaggressive rehabilitation. We prospectively evaluated a series of 100 consecutive patients who underwent ACL reconstruction between 2001 and 2002. A clinical and radiological follow-up was performed at a minimum of 6 years. After 6 years, the International Knee Documentation Committee score demonstrated good-to-excellent results (A and B) in 98% of patients. However, arthrometric results using the KT-1000 demonstrated that 6/80 patients (7.5%) had >5 mm manual maximum side-to-side difference. The median Tegner activity score was 5 (range 1-9); the median Lysholm score was 96 (range 81-100); and the median subjective IKDC score was 94 (range 66-100). We reported 6/80 failures as revealed by a 2+ or 3+ pivot-shift test result and/or KT-1000 side-to-side difference of more than 5 mm. The IKDC score revealed excellent results in all women who underwent extra-articular tenodesis. Radiographic evaluation demonstrated early signs of osteoarthritis in 9% of patients.",

      "# Title: Addition of anterolateral ligament reconstruction to primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction could benefit recovery of functional outcomes.\n# Abstract: This study aimed to compare functional outcomes sequentially up to 1 year after combined anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR) and isolated ACLR. Fifty patients who underwent ACLR with versus without ALLR were analyzed at four different time points (preoperatively and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively). For the functional outcomes, muscle strength and acceleration time (AT) were measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. Proprioception was evaluated using joint position sense and dynamic postural stability. Patient-reported outcomes were measured using the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK-11) scores. Functional performance was assessed using single-leg hop distance (SLHD) and Limb Symmetry Index. In the operated knees, quadriceps (at 6 months postoperatively, p = 0.003) and hamstring (at 6 and 12 months postoperatively, p < 0.001) strength were significantly higher in the combined ACLR and ALLR group than the isolated ACLR group. The TSK-11 (at 6 and 12 months postoperatively, p < 0.001) was significantly lower in the combined ACLR and ALLR group than the isolated ACLR group. SLHD was significantly higher in the combined ACLR and ALLR group than the isolated ACLR group (at 6 months, p = 0.022 and at 12 months, p = 0.024). The addition of ALLR to primary ACLR yielded better muscle performance, fear of movement, and functional performance than isolated ACLR."

The aim of this study was to compare clinical outcome in liver transplant patients with and without iron overload. We also sought to determine the prevalence of HFE mutations in liver transplant patients with iron overload. Of 456 consecutive liver transplants, 41 explants had an hepatic iron index (HII) greater than 1.9, and these cases were compared to 41 matched liver transplant recipients without increased hepatic iron. Posttransplantation complications, along with patient and graft survival were monitored. HFE gene testing was performed using DNA-based techniques. Kaplan-Meier 5-year patient survival after LTx was significantly lower in cases with hepatic iron overload compared to matched controls without iron excess (48% vs. 77%; P =.045). Fatal infections (especially fungal) were more common in patients with iron overload (24% vs. 7%; P =.03). Of the 41 patients with a liver explant HII greater than 1.9, only 4 were C282Y homozygotes. Patients with severe hepatic explant iron overload undergoing LTx have a reduced survival compared to liver transplant recipients without explant iron excess. The reduced survival was attributable mainly to fatal bacterial and fungal infections. Despite the iron overload, HFE gene mutations were uncommon in patients with hepatic explant hemosiderosis.",
      "# Title: Association of hepatic iron overload with invasive fungal infection in liver transplant recipients.\n# Abstract: Invasive fungal infection is a serious complication of orthotopic liver transplantation, but its risk factors remain incompletely defined. Iron overload has already been associated with increased risk of fungal infections, but it has not yet been assessed as a risk factor in liver transplantation. We retrospectively studied a cohort of 153 consecutive patients who underwent their first liver transplantation at a single center and who survived at least 7 days after transplantation. The association between various pretransplant patient characteristics, including hepatic explant iron and risk of invasive fungal infections, was analyzed by univariate and multivariate models. Iron in the hepatic explant was assessed by Perl's Prussian blue stain by a pathologist blinded to clinical outcome. During the first year after transplantation, 28 of 153 patients developed a total of 31 invasive fungal infections, of which 21 (68%) were caused by Candida, 7 (23%) by Aspergillus, 2 (6%) by Cryptococcus, and 1 (3%) by Saccharomyces. Stainable iron in the hepatic explant was found in 48 patients (31%). Stainable iron in the hepatic explant was found to be strongly and independently associated with posttransplantation fungal infections in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 3.09; 95% confidence interval 1.45-6.56; P = 0.003). Hepatic iron overload is strongly and independently associated with posttransplantation invasive fungal infections. Studies to confirm this finding in other centers and define the mechanism are warranted.",
      "# Title: Serum ferritin concentration predicts mortality in patients awaiting liver transplantation.\n# Abstract: Additional markers are required to identify patients on the orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) waiting list at increased risk of death and adverse clinical events. Serum ferritin concentration is a marker of varied pathophysiological events and is elevated with increased liver iron concentration, hepatic necroinflammation, and systemic illness, all of which may cause a deterioration in liver function and clinical status. The aim of this study was to determine whether serum ferritin concentration is an independent prognostic factor in subjects awaiting OLT. This is a dual-center retrospective study. The study cohort consisted of 191 consecutive adults with cirrhosis accepted by the Queensland (Australia) Liver Transplant Service between January 2000 and June 2006 and a validation cohort of 131 patients from University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Transplant Center. In the study cohort, baseline serum ferritin greater than 200 microg/L was an independent factor predicting increased 180-day and 1-year waiting list mortality. This effect was independent of model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), hepatocellular carcinoma, age, and sex. Subjects with higher serum ferritin had increased frequency of liver-related clinical events. The relationship between serum ferritin and waiting list mortality was confirmed in the UCLA cohort; all deceased patients had serum ferritin greater than 400 microg/L. Serum ferritin greater than 500 microg/L and MELD were independent risk factors for death.",

      "# Title: Serum ferritin concentration and transferrin saturation before liver transplantation predict decreased long-term recipient survival.\n# Abstract: Serum ferritin (SF) concentration is a widely available parameter used to assess iron homeostasis. It has been described as a marker to identify high-risk patients awaiting liver transplantation (LT) but is also elevated in systemic immune-mediated diseases, metabolic syndrome, and in hemodialysis where it is associated with an inferior prognosis. This study analyzed whether SF is not only a predictor of liver-related mortality prior to LT but also an independent marker of survival following LT. In a dual-center, retrospective study, a cohort of 328 consecutive first-LT patients from Hannover Medical School, Germany (2003-2008, follow-up 1260 days), and 82 consecutive LT patients from Regensburg University Hospital, Germany (2003-2007, follow-up 1355 days) as validation cohort were analyzed. In patients exhibiting SF ≥365 μg/L versus <365 μg/L prior to LT, 1-, 3-, and 5-year post-LT survival was 73.3% versus 81.1%, 64.4% versus 77.3%, and 61.1% versus 74.4%, respectively (overall survival P = 0.0097), which was confirmed in the validation cohort (overall survival of 55% versus 83.3%, P = 0.005). Multivariate analyses identified SF ≥365 μg/L combined with transferrin saturation (TFS) <55%, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the survival after LT (SALT) score as independent risk factors for death. In patients with SF concentrations ≥365 μg/L and TFS <55%, overall survival was 54% versus 74.8% in the remaining group (P = 0.003). In the validation cohort, it was 28.6% versus 72% (P = 0.017), respectively.",
      "# Title: The association of pretransplant ferritin level with waiting list and post-transplant survival. Does ferritin actually predict outcome?\n# Abstract: Recent data suggest an association of serum ferritin (SF) with waiting list (WL) and postliver transplant (LT) outcomes. To assess the predictive capacity of SF on pre- and post-LT outcomes, and to identify whether recipient or donor liver siderosis is associated with post-LT survival; a retrospective analysis of 1079 patients assessed for first LT, 2000-2007 was performed. Iron deposition in the liver tissue was assessed using a semi-quantitative grading system. Median age was 54 (18-82) years and 67% were male. Seventeen per cent had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Median Model for End-stage Liver Disease MELD score was 14 (6-40), ferritin was 174 μg/l (4-4597) with 36.5% had a SF ≥ μg/l. Age (OR = 1.028) and MELD score (OR = 1.158) were independently associated with WL mortality (P < 0.001), whilst SF was not (P = NS). Age (OR = 1.018), HCC (OR = 1.542) and cold ischemia time (CIT) ≥ 10 h (OR = 1.418) were independently associated with post-LT survival (P < 0.05). Explant siderosis grade <2 was seen in 376 (71.7%) patients. Patients with explant siderosis grade ≥ 2 had inferior 12-month post-LT survival (P = 0.030). Presence of graft siderosis (15.8% of patients) was not associated with survival. In conclusion, we found a limited role for SF as a prognostic indicator for pre- or post-transplant survival.",
      "# Title: Iron-related markers are associated with infection after liver transplantation.\n# Abstract: Though serum iron has been known to be associated with an increased risk of infection, hepcidin, the major regulator of iron metabolism, has never been systematically explored in this setting. Finding early biomarkers of infection, such as hepcidin, could help identify patients in whom early empiric antimicrobial therapy would be beneficial. We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients (n = 128) undergoing first-time, single-organ orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) without known iron overload disorders at 2 academic hospitals in Boston from August 2009 to November 2012. Cox regression compared the associations between different iron markers and the development of first infection at least 1 week after OLT; 47 (37%) patients developed a primary outcome of infection at least 1 week after OLT and 1 patient died. After adjusting for perioperative bleeding complications, number of hospital days, and hepatic artery thrombosis, changes in iron markers were associated with the development of infection post-OLT including increasing ferritin (hazard ratio [HR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-2.05), rising ferritin slope (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.17), and increasing hepcidin (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.05-1.93). A decreasing iron (HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.20-2.57) and a decreasing iron slope (HR, 4.21; 95% CI, 2.51-7.06) were also associated with subsequent infections. In conclusion, hepcidin and other serum iron markers and their slope patterns or their combination are associated with infection in vulnerable patient populations.

      "# Title: Iron metabolism imbalance at the time of listing increases overall and infectious mortality after liver transplantation.\n# Abstract: Liver transplantation (LT) is the best treatment for patients with liver cancer or end stage cirrhosis, but it is still associated with a significant mortality. Therefore identifying factors associated with mortality could help improve patient management. The impact of iron metabolism, which could be a relevant therapeutic target, yield discrepant results in this setting. Previous studies suggest that increased serum ferritin is associated with higher mortality. Surprisingly iron deficiency which is a well described risk factor in critically ill patients has not been considered."

    "referenceConclusion": "Pre-conditioning significantly reduced the severity of creatine kinase release, delayed-onset muscle soreness, loss of maximal voluntary contraction force and the range of motion decrease. Pre-conditioning may prevent severe EIMD and accelerate recovery of muscle force generation capacity. The current systematic review identified that pre-conditioning activities are effective in attenuating EIMD measures, CK, muscle soreness, ROM and maximal voluntary force production. These findings suggest the use of pre-conditioning activities prior to a strenuous bout of exercise does provide a significant protective effect when performed a minimum of 24 h prior to the damaging stimulus. Furthermore, the greater improvement in MVC suggests that the pre-conditioning activities may accelerate the recovery of muscle contractile properties following strenuous exercises. However, it is unclear if pre-conditioning would prevent EIMD from more complex exercises or to what extent EIMD prevention carries over into other modes of exercise.",

      "# Title: Muscle tenderness and peak torque changes after downhill running following a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: Unaccustomed exercise (usually of an eccentric nature) is often followed by delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Previous studies have found that prior eccentric activity produces a training effect which reduces DOMS and morphological changes. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a prior bout of maximal isokinetic eccentric exercise on DOMS, strength loss and plasma creatine kinase (CK) changes following a downhill run. Ten male subjects with a mean (+/- S.D.) age of 22.5 +/- 2.8 years, body mass of 62.67 +/- 0.05 kg and height of 176 +/- 3 cm were allocated to either a treatment group or a control group. The treatment group performed 100 maximal eccentric activations of the knee extensors in the dominant leg at 0.52 rad s-1. Two weeks later, the downhill run was performed on a motor-driven treadmill. This consisted of five bouts of 8 min at a gradient of -10% at a speed corresponding to 80% of the predicted maximal heart rate. The untrained group performed the downhill run as above but without the prior isokinetic session. Tenderness measurements, plasma CK activity and concentric and eccentric isokinetic peak torque measurements of the knee extensors at 0.52 and 2.83 rad s-1 were recorded prior to, immediately following and 2, 4 and 7 days after each protocol. The isokinetic protocol caused an increase (P < 0.01) in CK and tenderness and a decrease (P < 0.05) in concentric and eccentric torque at both speeds in the treatment group. Following the downhill run, a reduction in peak torque (P < 0.01) was observed in the eccentric and concentric modes at both isokinetic speeds in the control group. For the treatment group, the decrease in peak torque occurred only at the faster eccentric speed. With the exception of the faster eccentric speed, the decrement in peak torque was greater in the control group in all post-exercise isokinetic strength tests. There was less tenderness (P < 0.01) in the trained knee extensor muscle group. Peak torque also returned to pre-downhill values earlier for the trained group. Although plasma CK activity increased in both groups after downhill running, it was much lower (P < 0.01) in the trained group. The results suggest that a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric training reduces muscle damage, reduces the amount of strength loss and decreases the sensation of DOMS after downhill running.",
      "# Title: Exercise-induced skeletal muscle damage and adaptation following repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions.\n# Abstract: Repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions were used to examine indirect indices of exercise-induced muscle damage and adaptation in human skeletal muscle. Twenty-four subjects (18 females, 6 males) aged 20.0 +/- 1.4 years (mean +/- S.D.) performed an initial bout of either 10 (n = 7), 30 (n = 9) or 50 (n = 8) maximum voluntary eccentric contractions of the knee extensors, followed by a second bout of 50 contractions 3 weeks later using the same leg. Muscle soreness was elevated after all bouts (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon test), although the initial bout reduced the soreness associated with the second bout. Force loss and a decline in the 20:100 Hz percutaneous electrical myostimulation force ratio were observed after all exercise bouts (P < 0.01). Serum creatine kinase activity was elevated following the initial bouts of 30 and 50 repetitions (P < 0.01), but there was no increase following 10 repetitions. No increase in serum creatine kinase activity was observed in any group following the second bout of contractions (P > 0.05). We conclude that skeletal muscle adaptation can be brought about by a single bout of relatively few eccentric muscle contractions. Increasing the number of eccentric muscle repetitions did not result in an increased prophylactic effect on skeletal muscle.",
      "# Title: Influence of previous concentric exercise on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether a fatiguing concentric exercise performed immediately before eccentric exercise would exacerbate eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. One arm of nine female subjects (mean +/- s: 23.3 +/- 6.7 years) performed 12 maximal eccentric actions of the elbow flexors (ECC), and the other arm performed 100 repetitions of isokinetic concentric actions of the elbow flexors followed by the same eccentric exercise (CON-ECC). The two exercise regimens (ECC and CON-ECC) were separated by 2 weeks and presented in a counterbalanced order. Changes in muscle soreness level, maximal isometric force generation, relaxed and flexed elbow joint angle, upper arm circumference and plasma creatine kinase activity were compared between the ECC and CON-ECC conditions. All measures changed significantly after both ECC and CON-ECC; however, there were significant differences in the changes between the conditions. A lower level of soreness, a faster recovery of maximal isometric force generation, a smaller decrease in relaxed elbow joint angle and a smaller increase in upper arm circumference and creatine kinase activity were evident after the CON-ECC condition compared to the ECC condition. Thus, it would seem that muscle damage was attenuated by performance of previous concentric exercise. An additional experiment using a different group of subjects (n = 5) showed that warm-up exercise before the eccentric exercise also attenuated eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.",

      "# Title: The repeated bout effect of reduced-load eccentric exercise on elbow flexor muscle damage.\n# Abstract: In this study we investigated the extent to which an initial eccentric exercise consisting of two (2ECC) or six maximal eccentric actions (6ECC) of the elbow flexors would produce a similar effect to 24 maximal eccentric actions (24ECC), on a second bout of 24ECC performed 2 weeks later. Male students (n = 34) were assigned to one of three groups, and with their non-dominant arm performed either 2ECC (n = 12), 6ECC (n = 10), or 24ECC (n = 12) as a first bout of exercise. Two weeks later all groups performed 24ECC. Maximal isometric strength, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration were assessed before, immediately after, and for 4 days after exercise. Changes in all variables were compared between the bouts and groups by a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance. All variables changed significantly (P< 0.05) after 2ECC, 6ECC, and 24ECC, but the amount of change after 2ECC and 6ECC was significantly smaller (P<0.05) than both 6ECC and 24ECC, and 24ECC, respectively. After the second bout, the 6ECC and 24ECC groups showed a profound repeated bout effect, and no significant differences were found between the groups. All variables except muscle soreness were significantly (P< 0.05) larger after the second bout for the 2ECC group, however the changes observed after 24ECC were significantly smaller (P < 0.01) than those observed after the first 24ECC of the 24ECC group. These results suggest that it is not necessary to conduct a high number of eccentric actions in the first bout to elicit a repeated bout effect in a subsequent bout performed some time later.",

      "# Title: Intensity of eccentric exercise, shift of optimum angle, and the magnitude of repeated-bout effect.\n# Abstract: This study compared the effect of four different intensities of initial eccentric exercise (ECC1) on optimum angle shift and extent of muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise. Fifty-two male students were placed into 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% groups (n = 13 per group), performing 30 eccentric actions of the elbow flexors of 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% of maximal isometric strength [maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)] for ECC1, followed 2-3 wk later by a similar exercise (ECC2) that used 100% MVC load. MVC at six elbow joint angles, range of motion, upper arm circumference, serum creatine kinase activity, myoglobin concentration, and muscle soreness were measured before and for 5 days following ECC1 and ECC2. A rightward shift of optimum angle following ECC1 was significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 100% and 80% than for the 60% and 40% groups, and it decreased significantly (P < 0.05) from immediately to 5 days postexercise. By the time ECC2 was performed, only the 100% group kept a significant shift (4 degrees). Changes in most of the criterion measures following ECC1 were significantly greater for the 100% and 80% groups compared with the 60% and 40% groups. Changes in the criterion measures following ECC2 were significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 40% group compared with other groups. Although the magnitude of repeated bout effect following ECC2 was significantly (P < 0.05) smaller for the 40% and 60% groups, all groups showed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced changes in criterion measures following ECC2 compared with the ECC1 100% bout. We conclude that the repeated-bout effect was not dependent on the shift of optimum angle.",
      "# Title: Repeated bout effect after maximal eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: We hypothesized that a bout of high or low volume eccentric exercise would protect against muscle damage following a subsequent high volume bout and that adaptation would be attributable to neural changes, independent of the initial exercise volume. Sixteen males performed either 45 (ECC45) or 10 (ECC10) maximal eccentric contractions using the elbow flexors, followed by an ECC45 bout 2 weeks later. Damage markers were measured for the following 96 h; EMG and work done during the first 10 eccentric contractions were also recorded. CK, soreness, and decrements in MVC and range of motion (ROM) were greater in bout 1 than bout 2 (p < 0.01). Soreness, MVC and ROM were greater after the initial ECC45 bout compared to the initial ECC10 bout and the repeated bouts of ECC45 exercise in both groups (p < 0.01). Median frequency decreased from bout 1 to bout 2 (p < 0.001), no differences between groups were observed. An ECC45 bout of maximal eccentric exercise causes more initial damage than an ECC10 bout of maximal eccentric exercise, although both confer protection from subsequent ECC45 bouts of maximal eccentric contractions, which are attributable, at least in part, to a shift in the frequency content of EMG.",
      "# Title: A light load eccentric exercise confers protection against a subsequent bout of more demanding eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that a light eccentric exercise (ECC) that does not induce a loss of muscle function and delayed onset muscle soreness would confer a protective effect against a more strenuous ECC. Eighteen young men were randomly placed into two groups: 10-40% (n=9) and 40% (n=9). Subjects in the 10-40% group performed ECC of the elbow flexors (six sets of five reps) using a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (MVC) at an elbow joint angle of 90 degrees , followed 2 days later by ECC using a dumbbell weight of 40% MVC. Subjects in the 40% group performed the 40% ECC only. Changes in MVC, range of motion (ROM), upper arm circumference (CIR), plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and muscle soreness before, immediately after, 1-5 and 7 days following the 40% ECC were compared between groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any of the criterion measures were found immediately and 1-2 days after the 10% ECC. Following the 40% ECC, the 10-40% group showed significantly (P<0.05) smaller decreases in MVC and ROM, and smaller increases in muscle soreness compared with the 40% group, but no significant differences between groups were evident for CIR and plasma CK activity. These results suggest that the 10% ECC induced some protection against a subsequent bout of 40% ECC performed 2 days later. It appears that the light eccentric exercise preconditioned the muscles for exposure to the subsequent damaging eccentric exercise bout.",
      "# Title: Protection against muscle damage following fifty drop jumps conferred by ten drop jumps.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether 10 drop jumps (DJs) would confer protective effect against muscle damage and soreness in a subsequent bout of 50 DJs. Sixteen men were randomly placed into either a group performing 1 set of 10 DJs followed by 5 sets of 10 DJs (10-50, n = 8) or another group performing 2 bouts of 5 sets of 10 DJs (50-50, n = 8) separated by 2 weeks. The DJs were performed from a box height of 0.6 m, with a 10-second interval between jumps and a 1-minute rest between sets. Jump height, peak vertical ground reaction force, ground contact time, and heart rate during DJs were measured, and blood lactate concentration was assessed before and immediately after DJs. Changes in maximal isometric (ISO) and isokinetic concentric torque (CON), vertical jump, muscle soreness, and plasma creatine kinase activity before, immediately after, and at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours following exercise were compared between groups for the first and second bouts and between the bouts by a 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance. Changes in ISO, CON, vertical jump, and muscle soreness were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller for 10 DJs compared with 50 DJs; however, no significant differences in the measures between groups were evident following the second bout. The changes in the measures following 50 DJs in the 10-50 group were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller than those following the first bout of the 50-50 group. These results suggest that 10 DJs and 50 DJs conferred the same magnitude of protective effect against muscle damage by 50 DJs.",
      "# Title: Muscle damage protection by low-intensity eccentric contractions remains for 2 weeks but not 3 weeks.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that the protective effect conferred by a low-intensity eccentric exercise against maximal eccentric exercise would not last more than a week. Untrained men (21.3 ± 1.6 years) were allocated into either a control or one of four repeated bout groups (n = 13 per group). The repeated bout groups performed 30 low-intensity eccentric contractions (ECC) of the elbow flexors with a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (10%-ECC) either 2 days, 7 days (1 week), 14 days (2 weeks) or 21 days (3 weeks) before 30 maximal eccentric contractions (Max-ECC). The control group performed Max-ECC only. Changes in maximal voluntary contraction strength, optimum angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following 10%-ECC were analysed by a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Changes in the variables following Max-ECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. The 10%-ECC did not change any variables, showing no indication of muscle damage. The changes in all variables following Max-ECC were smaller (P < 0.05) for 2-day, 1- and 2-week groups than control group, without significant differences between 2-day and 1-week groups. The 2-week group showed greater (P < 0.05) changes in all variables compared with 2-day and 1-week groups. Changes in the variables were similar between 3-week and control groups, except for muscle soreness showing smaller (P < 0.05) changes for 3-week group. These results suggest that non-damaging eccentric exercise confers a protective effect against Max-Ecc, but the effect is attenuated between 1 and 2 weeks.",
      "# Title: Two maximal isometric contractions attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVC-ISO) would attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. Young untrained men were placed into one of the two experimental groups or one control group (n = 13 per group). Subjects in the experimental groups performed either two or 10 MVC-ISO of the elbow flexors at a long muscle length (20° flexion) 2 days prior to 30 maximal isokinetic eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors. Subjects in the control group performed the eccentric contractions without MVC-ISO. No significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction peak torque, peak torque angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and myoglobin concentration, muscle soreness, and ultrasound echo intensity were evident after MVC-ISO. Changes in the variables following eccentric contractions were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2 MVC-ISO group (e.g., peak torque loss at 5 days after exercise, 23% ± 3%; peak CK activity, 1964 ± 452 IU·L(-1); peak muscle soreness, 46 ± 4 mm) or the 10 MVC-ISO group (13% ± 3%, 877 ± 198 IU·L(-1), 30 ± 4 mm) compared with the control (34% ± 4%, 6192 ± 1747 IU·L(-1), 66 ± 5 mm). The 10 MVC-ISO group showed smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following eccentric contractions compared with the 2 MVC-ISO group. Therefore, two MVC-ISO conferred potent protective effects against muscle damage, whereas greater protective effect was induced by 10 MVC-ISO, which can be used as a strategy to minimize muscle damage.",

Healthy older men (66.4 ± 4.6 years) were assigned to control or experimental (Exp) group (n = 13 per group). The control group performed six sets of ten maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC) of the knee extensors of non-dominant leg. The Exp group performed six sets of ten low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors on a leg extension machine by lowering a weight of 10 % maximal voluntary isometric knee extension strength (10 %ECC) 7 days prior to MaxECC. Changes in maximal voluntary isokinetic concentric torque (MVC-CON), angle at peak torque, range of motion (ROM), upper thigh circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin (Mb) concentration and B-mode ultrasound echo-intensity before and for 5 days after MaxECC were compared between groups by a mixed factor ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were observed following 10 %ECC. Following MaxECC, all variables changed significantly, and changes in all variables except for angle at peak torque were significantly different between groups. MVC-CON and ROM decreased smaller and recovered faster (P < 0.05) for Exp than control group, and changes in other variables were smaller (P < 0.05) for Exp group compared with control group. These results suggest that preconditioning knee extensor muscles with low-intensity eccentric contractions was effective for attenuating muscle damage induced by subsequent MaxECC of the knee extensors for elderly individuals.",

Sixty-five young untrained men were randomly assigned to a control group that did not perform 2MVCs, or one of four experimental groups (n = 13 per group) who performed 2MVCs either immediately (0d), 2 (2d), 4 (4d) or 7 days (7d) before MaxECC. Changes in maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) concentric torque (MVC-CON), optimum angle (OA), range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following MaxECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were evident following 2MVCs. The 2d and 4d groups showed 16-62 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following MaxECC than the control, 0d and 7d groups. The 2d group showed 14-34 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables except for OA compared with the 4d group. The changes in the variables were similar among the control, 0d and 7d groups. These results show that 2MVCs that were performed between 2 and 4 days before MaxECC attenuated the magnitude of muscle damage, but no such effect was evident if the 2MVCs were performed immediately or 7 days before MaxECC. It is concluded that the protective effect conferred by 2MVCs is relatively short-lived, and there is a window for the effect to be conferred.",
      "# Title: Effect of a prior bout of preconditioning exercise on muscle damage from downhill walking.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether reduced-duration downhill walking (DW) would confer a protective effect against muscle damage induced by a subsequent bout of longer duration DW performed 1 week or 4 weeks later. Healthy young adults were allocated to a control or one of the preconditioning exercise (PRE-1wk or PRE-4wk) groups (10 men and 4 women per group). PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups performed 20-min DW (-28% slope, 5 km/h, 10% body mass added to a backpack) 1 week and 4 weeks before 40-min DW, respectively, and the control group performed 40-min DW only. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) knee extension torque, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity, and muscle soreness (100-mm visual analog scale) were measured before, immediately after, and 24, 48, and 72 h after DW, and the changes in these variables were compared among groups. The control group showed symptoms of muscle damage (e.g., prolonged decrease in MVC: -14% ± 10% at 48 h post-DW) after 40-min DW. Changes in all variables after 40-min DW of PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups were 54%-61% smaller (P < 0.05) than the control group, without significant differences between PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups for MVC and plasma CK activity. Importantly, changes after the preconditioning exercise (20-min DW) were 67%-69% smaller (P < 0.05) than those after the 40-min DW of the control group. These findings suggest that 20-min DW resulting in minor muscle damage conferred a protective effect against subsequent 40-min DW, and its effect could last for more than 4 weeks.",

      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors and flexors protect against muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the magnitude and duration of the protective effect of low-intensity eccentric contractions (LowEC) against damage induced by maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) of the knee flexors (KF) and extensors (KE). Young men were assigned to 8 experimental groups and 2 control groups (n = 13/group); the experimental groups performed LowEC of KF or KE 2 days (2d), 1 week (1wk), 2 weeks (2wk), or 3 weeks (3wk) before MaxEC, while the control groups performed MaxEC of KF or KE without LowEC. The 2d, 1wk, 2wk, and 3wk groups performed 30 LowEC of KF or 60 LowEC of KE with a load of 10% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction strength on a resistance-training machine, and all groups performed 30 MaxEC of KF or 60 MaxEC of KE on an isokinetic dynamometer. Several muscle damage markers were measured from before to 2 days after exercise (LowEC) or from before to 5 days after exercise (MaxEC). No significant changes in any variables were evident after LowEC. The changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2d and 1wk groups (e.g., peak creatine kinase activity: 1002 ± 501 IU/L; peak muscle soreness: 13 ± 5 mm) than for the control group (peak creatine kinase activity: 3005 ± 983 IU/L; peak muscle soreness 28 ± 6 mm) for both KE and KF. There were no significant differences between the 2d and 1wk groups or among the 2wk, 3wk, and control groups. These results show that LowEC provided 30%-66% protection against damage induced by MaxEC of KF and KE, and the protective effect lasted 1 week.",
      "# Title: Protective effect by maximal isometric contractions against maximal eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the knee extensors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) performed before maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) would attenuate muscle damage of the knee extensors. Untrained men were placed to an experimental group that performed 6 sets of 10 MVIC at 90° knee flexion 2 weeks before 6 sets of 10 MaxEC or a control group that performed MaxEC only (n = 13/group). Changes in muscle damage markers were assessed before to 5 days after each exercise. Small but significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction torque, range of motion (ROM) and plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity were evident at immediately to 2 days post-MVIC (p < 0.05), but other variables (e.g. thigh girth, myoglobin concentration, B-mode echo intensity) did not change significantly. Changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (p < 0.05) by 45% (soreness)-67% (CK) for the experimental than the control group. These results suggest that MVIC conferred potent protective effect against MaxEC-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Prevention of downhill walking-induced muscle damage by non-damaging downhill walking.\n# Abstract: Mountain trekking involves level, uphill, and downhill walking (DW). Prolonged DW induces damage to leg muscles, reducing force generating ability and muscle coordination. These increase risks for more serious injuries and accidents in mountain trekking, thus a strategy to minimize muscle damage is warranted. It has been shown that low-intensity eccentric contractions confer protective effect on muscle damage induced by high-intensity eccentric contractions. This study tested the hypothesis that 5-min non-damaging DW would attenuate muscle damage induced by 40-min DW, but 5-min level walking (LW) would not.",
      "# Title: Isometric pre-conditioning blunts exercise-induced muscle damage but does not attenuate changes in running economy following downhill running.\n# Abstract: Running economy (RE) is impaired following unaccustomed eccentric-biased exercises that induce muscle damage. It is also known that muscle damage is reduced when maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) are performed at a long muscle length 2-4 days prior to maximal eccentric exercise with the same muscle, a phenomenon that can be described as isometric pre-conditioning (IPC). We tested the hypothesis that IPC could attenuate muscle damage and changes in RE following downhill running. Thirty untrained men were randomly assigned into experimental or control groups and ran downhill on a treadmill (-15%) for 30 min. Participants in the experimental group completed 10 MVIC in a leg press machine two days prior to downhill running, while participants in the control group did not perform IPC. The magnitude of changes in muscle soreness determined 48 h after downhill running was greater for the control group (122 ± 28 mm) than for the experimental group (92 ± 38 mm). Isometric peak torque recovered faster in the experimental group compared with the control group (3 days vs. no full recovery, respectively). No significant effect of IPC was found for countermovement jump height, serum creatine kinase activity or any parameters associated with RE. These results supported the hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in markers of muscle damage. The hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in RE was not supported by our data. It appears that the mechanisms involved in changes in markers of muscle damage and parameters associated with RE following downhill running are not completely shared.",
      "# Title: Damage protective effects conferred by low-intensity eccentric contractions on arm, leg and trunk muscles.\n# Abstract: Low-intensity eccentric contractions with a load corresponding to 10% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction strength (10% EC) attenuate muscle damage in a subsequent bout of higher-intensity eccentric contractions performed within 2 weeks for the elbow flexors, knee flexors and knee extensors. However, it is not known whether this strategy could be applied to other muscles. This study investigated whether 10% EC would confer damage protective effect on high-intensity eccentric contractions (80% EC) for nine different muscle groups.",
      "# Title: Protective Effect Conferred by Isometric Preconditioning Against Slow- and Fast-Velocity Eccentric Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage.\n# Abstract: We investigated if the same isometric preconditioning protocol (IPP) attenuates the magnitude of muscle damage induced by different maximal eccentric exercise protocols in the elbow flexors. Sixty-four untrained men were assigned to either two experimental or two control groups. Participants in the experimental groups performed an IPP prior to either slow (60°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-S) or fast (180°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-F) maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC). Subjects in the control groups performed slow (ECC-S) or fast (ECC-F) MaxECC without IPP. Maximal isokinetic concentric torque (MVC), muscle soreness (SOR), and muscle thickness (MT) were assessed before, immediately after, and 1-4 days following the MaxECC. Significant (p < 0.05) group vs. time interactions were found for MVC (F = 4,517), SOR (F = 6,318), and MT (F = 1,863). The ECC-S group presented faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and MT and less (p < 0.05) SOR at 96 h post-MaxECC compared with ECC-F group. No significant differences in MVC and MT were found between ECC-S and ECC-F groups following MaxECC. The ISO + ECC-S group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and SOR compared to the ECC-S group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ECC-S in any variable. The ISO + ECC-F group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of all assessed variables compared with the ECC-F group. MVC was greater (p < 0.05) at 48-72 h, and SOR was less (p < 0.05) at 48-96 h in the ISO + ECC-F compared to the ECC-F group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ISO + ECC-F for any variable. These results show that the IPP accelerated recovery of MVC and SOR for the slow-eccentric exercise condition and attenuated strength loss and SOR in addition to faster recovery of all assessed variables for the fast-eccentric exercise condition. Therefore, the IPP can be used as a strategy to attenuate and accelerate recovery of muscle damage induced by different-velocity eccentric exercises, resulting in greater protection against muscle damage induced by faster velocity."

      "conclusionA": "Based strictly on the provided context, the primary concluding statement is:\n\n**Pre-conditioning exercise consistently attenuates markers of Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage (EIMD) compared to no pre-conditioning, significantly reducing DOMS, CK levels, and preserving muscle function, with the magnitude and duration of this protective effect being critically dependent on the characteristics of the pre-conditioning stimulus (type, intensity, timing) and the characteristics of the subsequent damaging exercise.**",
      "conclusionB": "Performing a non-damaging, low-intensity bout of eccentric exercise, or even isometric contractions, performed between 2 and 4 days prior to a subsequent maximal eccentric exercise bout significantly attenuates markers of muscle damage, such as reduced soreness, smaller decrements in strength, and lower creatine kinase activity, demonstrating a protective effect that can last for at least 1-2 weeks."

    "referenceConclusion": "Pre-conditioning significantly reduced the severity of creatine kinase release, delayed-onset muscle soreness, loss of maximal voluntary contraction force and the range of motion decrease. Pre-conditioning may prevent severe EIMD and accelerate recovery of muscle force generation capacity. The current systematic review identified that pre-conditioning activities are effective in attenuating EIMD measures, CK, muscle soreness, ROM and maximal voluntary force production. These findings suggest the use of pre-conditioning activities prior to a strenuous bout of exercise does provide a significant protective effect when performed a minimum of 24 h prior to the damaging stimulus. Furthermore, the greater improvement in MVC suggests that the pre-conditioning activities may accelerate the recovery of muscle contractile properties following strenuous exercises. However, it is unclear if pre-conditioning would prevent EIMD from more complex exercises or to what extent EIMD prevention carries over into other modes of exercise.",

      "# Title: Muscle tenderness and peak torque changes after downhill running following a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: Unaccustomed exercise (usually of an eccentric nature) is often followed by delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Previous studies have found that prior eccentric activity produces a training effect which reduces DOMS and morphological changes. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a prior bout of maximal isokinetic eccentric exercise on DOMS, strength loss and plasma creatine kinase (CK) changes following a downhill run. Ten male subjects with a mean (+/- S.D.) age of 22.5 +/- 2.8 years, body mass of 62.67 +/- 0.05 kg and height of 176 +/- 3 cm were allocated to either a treatment group or a control group. The treatment group performed 100 maximal eccentric activations of the knee extensors in the dominant leg at 0.52 rad s-1. Two weeks later, the downhill run was performed on a motor-driven treadmill. This consisted of five bouts of 8 min at a gradient of -10% at a speed corresponding to 80% of the predicted maximal heart rate. The untrained group performed the downhill run as above but without the prior isokinetic session. Tenderness measurements, plasma CK activity and concentric and eccentric isokinetic peak torque measurements of the knee extensors at 0.52 and 2.83 rad s-1 were recorded prior to, immediately following and 2, 4 and 7 days after each protocol. The isokinetic protocol caused an increase (P < 0.01) in CK and tenderness and a decrease (P < 0.05) in concentric and eccentric torque at both speeds in the treatment group. Following the downhill run, a reduction in peak torque (P < 0.01) was observed in the eccentric and concentric modes at both isokinetic speeds in the control group. For the treatment group, the decrease in peak torque occurred only at the faster eccentric speed. With the exception of the faster eccentric speed, the decrement in peak torque was greater in the control group in all post-exercise isokinetic strength tests. There was less tenderness (P < 0.01) in the trained knee extensor muscle group. Peak torque also returned to pre-downhill values earlier for the trained group. Although plasma CK activity increased in both groups after downhill running, it was much lower (P < 0.01) in the trained group. The results suggest that a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric training reduces muscle damage, reduces the amount of strength loss and decreases the sensation of DOMS after downhill running.",
      "# Title: Exercise-induced skeletal muscle damage and adaptation following repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions.\n# Abstract: Repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions were used to examine indirect indices of exercise-induced muscle damage and adaptation in human skeletal muscle. Twenty-four subjects (18 females, 6 males) aged 20.0 +/- 1.4 years (mean +/- S.D.) performed an initial bout of either 10 (n = 7), 30 (n = 9) or 50 (n = 8) maximum voluntary eccentric contractions of the knee extensors, followed by a second bout of 50 contractions 3 weeks later using the same leg. Muscle soreness was elevated after all bouts (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon test), although the initial bout reduced the soreness associated with the second bout. Force loss and a decline in the 20:100 Hz percutaneous electrical myostimulation force ratio were observed after all exercise bouts (P < 0.01). Serum creatine kinase activity was elevated following the initial bouts of 30 and 50 repetitions (P < 0.01), but there was no increase following 10 repetitions. No increase in serum creatine kinase activity was observed in any group following the second bout of contractions (P > 0.05). We conclude that skeletal muscle adaptation can be brought about by a single bout of relatively few eccentric muscle contractions. Increasing the number of eccentric muscle repetitions did not result in an increased prophylactic effect on skeletal muscle.",
      "# Title: Influence of previous concentric exercise on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether a fatiguing concentric exercise performed immediately before eccentric exercise would exacerbate eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. One arm of nine female subjects (mean +/- s: 23.3 +/- 6.7 years) performed 12 maximal eccentric actions of the elbow flexors (ECC), and the other arm performed 100 repetitions of isokinetic concentric actions of the elbow flexors followed by the same eccentric exercise (CON-ECC). The two exercise regimens (ECC and CON-ECC) were separated by 2 weeks and presented in a counterbalanced order. Changes in muscle soreness level, maximal isometric force generation, relaxed and flexed elbow joint angle, upper arm circumference and plasma creatine kinase activity were compared between the ECC and CON-ECC conditions. All measures changed significantly after both ECC and CON-ECC; however, there were significant differences in the changes between the conditions. A lower level of soreness, a faster recovery of maximal isometric force generation, a smaller decrease in relaxed elbow joint angle and a smaller increase in upper arm circumference and creatine kinase activity were evident after the CON-ECC condition compared to the ECC condition. Thus, it would seem that muscle damage was attenuated by performance of previous concentric exercise. An additional experiment using a different group of subjects (n = 5) showed that warm-up exercise before the eccentric exercise also attenuated eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Acute adaptation to low volume eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: Many symptoms of eccentric muscle damage can be substantially reduced if a similar eccentric bout is repeated within several weeks of the initial bout. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a nondamaging, low repetition, low volume eccentric exercise bout could also provide a protective/adaptive effect.",
      "# Title: The repeated bout effect of reduced-load eccentric exercise on elbow flexor muscle damage.\n# Abstract: In this study we investigated the extent to which an initial eccentric exercise consisting of two (2ECC) or six maximal eccentric actions (6ECC) of the elbow flexors would produce a similar effect to 24 maximal eccentric actions (24ECC), on a second bout of 24ECC performed 2 weeks later. Male students (n = 34) were assigned to one of three groups, and with their non-dominant arm performed either 2ECC (n = 12), 6ECC (n = 10), or 24ECC (n = 12) as a first bout of exercise. Two weeks later all groups performed 24ECC. Maximal isometric strength, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration were assessed before, immediately after, and for 4 days after exercise. Changes in all variables were compared between the bouts and groups by a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance. All variables changed significantly (P< 0.05) after 2ECC, 6ECC, and 24ECC, but the amount of change after 2ECC and 6ECC was significantly smaller (P<0.05) than both 6ECC and 24ECC, and 24ECC, respectively. After the second bout, the 6ECC and 24ECC groups showed a profound repeated bout effect, and no significant differences were found between the groups. All variables except muscle soreness were significantly (P< 0.05) larger after the second bout for the 2ECC group, however the changes observed after 24ECC were significantly smaller (P < 0.01) than those observed after the first 24ECC of the 24ECC group. These results suggest that it is not necessary to conduct a high number of eccentric actions in the first bout to elicit a repeated bout effect in a subsequent bout performed some time later.",

      "# Title: Intensity of eccentric exercise, shift of optimum angle, and the magnitude of repeated-bout effect.\n# Abstract: This study compared the effect of four different intensities of initial eccentric exercise (ECC1) on optimum angle shift and extent of muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise. Fifty-two male students were placed into 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% groups (n = 13 per group), performing 30 eccentric actions of the elbow flexors of 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% of maximal isometric strength [maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)] for ECC1, followed 2-3 wk later by a similar exercise (ECC2) that used 100% MVC load. MVC at six elbow joint angles, range of motion, upper arm circumference, serum creatine kinase activity, myoglobin concentration, and muscle soreness were measured before and for 5 days following ECC1 and ECC2. A rightward shift of optimum angle following ECC1 was significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 100% and 80% than for the 60% and 40% groups, and it decreased significantly (P < 0.05) from immediately to 5 days postexercise. By the time ECC2 was performed, only the 100% group kept a significant shift (4 degrees). Changes in most of the criterion measures following ECC1 were significantly greater for the 100% and 80% groups compared with the 60% and 40% groups. Changes in the criterion measures following ECC2 were significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 40% group compared with other groups. Although the magnitude of repeated bout effect following ECC2 was significantly (P < 0.05) smaller for the 40% and 60% groups, all groups showed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced changes in criterion measures following ECC2 compared with the ECC1 100% bout. We conclude that the repeated-bout effect was not dependent on the shift of optimum angle.",
      "# Title: Repeated bout effect after maximal eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: We hypothesized that a bout of high or low volume eccentric exercise would protect against muscle damage following a subsequent high volume bout and that adaptation would be attributable to neural changes, independent of the initial exercise volume. Sixteen males performed either 45 (ECC45) or 10 (ECC10) maximal eccentric contractions using the elbow flexors, followed by an ECC45 bout 2 weeks later. Damage markers were measured for the following 96 h; EMG and work done during the first 10 eccentric contractions were also recorded. CK, soreness, and decrements in MVC and range of motion (ROM) were greater in bout 1 than bout 2 (p < 0.01). Soreness, MVC and ROM were greater after the initial ECC45 bout compared to the initial ECC10 bout and the repeated bouts of ECC45 exercise in both groups (p < 0.01). Median frequency decreased from bout 1 to bout 2 (p < 0.001), no differences between groups were observed. An ECC45 bout of maximal eccentric exercise causes more initial damage than an ECC10 bout of maximal eccentric exercise, although both confer protection from subsequent ECC45 bouts of maximal eccentric contractions, which are attributable, at least in part, to a shift in the frequency content of EMG.",
      "# Title: A light load eccentric exercise confers protection against a subsequent bout of more demanding eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that a light eccentric exercise (ECC) that does not induce a loss of muscle function and delayed onset muscle soreness would confer a protective effect against a more strenuous ECC. Eighteen young men were randomly placed into two groups: 10-40% (n=9) and 40% (n=9). Subjects in the 10-40% group performed ECC of the elbow flexors (six sets of five reps) using a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (MVC) at an elbow joint angle of 90 degrees , followed 2 days later by ECC using a dumbbell weight of 40% MVC. Subjects in the 40% group performed the 40% ECC only. Changes in MVC, range of motion (ROM), upper arm circumference (CIR), plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and muscle soreness before, immediately after, 1-5 and 7 days following the 40% ECC were compared between groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any of the criterion measures were found immediately and 1-2 days after the 10% ECC. Following the 40% ECC, the 10-40% group showed significantly (P<0.05) smaller decreases in MVC and ROM, and smaller increases in muscle soreness compared with the 40% group, but no significant differences between groups were evident for CIR and plasma CK activity. These results suggest that the 10% ECC induced some protection against a subsequent bout of 40% ECC performed 2 days later. It appears that the light eccentric exercise preconditioned the muscles for exposure to the subsequent damaging eccentric exercise bout.",
      "# Title: Protection against muscle damage following fifty drop jumps conferred by ten drop jumps.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether 10 drop jumps (DJs) would confer protective effect against muscle damage and soreness in a subsequent bout of 50 DJs. Sixteen men were randomly placed into either a group performing 1 set of 10 DJs followed by 5 sets of 10 DJs (10-50, n = 8) or another group performing 2 bouts of 5 sets of 10 DJs (50-50, n = 8) separated by 2 weeks. The DJs were performed from a box height of 0.6 m, with a 10-second interval between jumps and a 1-minute rest between sets. Jump height, peak vertical ground reaction force, ground contact time, and heart rate during DJs were measured, and blood lactate concentration was assessed before and immediately after DJs. Changes in maximal isometric (ISO) and isokinetic concentric torque (CON), vertical jump, muscle soreness, and plasma creatine kinase activity before, immediately after, and at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours following exercise were compared between groups for the first and second bouts and between the bouts by a 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance. Changes in ISO, CON, vertical jump, and muscle soreness were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller for 10 DJs compared with 50 DJs; however, no significant differences in the measures between groups were evident following the second bout. The changes in the measures following 50 DJs in the 10-50 group were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller than those following the first bout of the 50-50 group. These results suggest that 10 DJs and 50 DJs conferred the same magnitude of protective effect against muscle damage by 50 DJs.",
      "# Title: Muscle damage protection by low-intensity eccentric contractions remains for 2 weeks but not 3 weeks.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that the protective effect conferred by a low-intensity eccentric exercise against maximal eccentric exercise would not last more than a week. Untrained men (21.3 ± 1.6 years) were allocated into either a control or one of four repeated bout groups (n = 13 per group). The repeated bout groups performed 30 low-intensity eccentric contractions (ECC) of the elbow flexors with a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (10%-ECC) either 2 days, 7 days (1 week), 14 days (2 weeks) or 21 days (3 weeks) before 30 maximal eccentric contractions (Max-ECC). The control group performed Max-ECC only. Changes in maximal voluntary contraction strength, optimum angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following 10%-ECC were analysed by a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Changes in the variables following Max-ECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. The 10%-ECC did not change any variables, showing no indication of muscle damage. The changes in all variables following Max-ECC were smaller (P < 0.05) for 2-day, 1- and 2-week groups than control group, without significant differences between 2-day and 1-week groups. The 2-week group showed greater (P < 0.05) changes in all variables compared with 2-day and 1-week groups. Changes in the variables were similar between 3-week and control groups, except for muscle soreness showing smaller (P < 0.05) changes for 3-week group. These results suggest that non-damaging eccentric exercise confers a protective effect against Max-Ecc, but the effect is attenuated between 1 and 2 weeks.",
      "# Title: Two maximal isometric contractions attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVC-ISO) would attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. Young untrained men were placed into one of the two experimental groups or one control group (n = 13 per group). Subjects in the experimental groups performed either two or 10 MVC-ISO of the elbow flexors at a long muscle length (20° flexion) 2 days prior to 30 maximal isokinetic eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors. Subjects in the control group performed the eccentric contractions without MVC-ISO. No significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction peak torque, peak torque angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and myoglobin concentration, muscle soreness, and ultrasound echo intensity were evident after MVC-ISO. Changes in the variables following eccentric contractions were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2 MVC-ISO group (e.g., peak torque loss at 5 days after exercise, 23% ± 3%; peak CK activity, 1964 ± 452 IU·L(-1); peak muscle soreness, 46 ± 4 mm) or the 10 MVC-ISO group (13% ± 3%, 877 ± 198 IU·L(-1), 30 ± 4 mm) compared with the control (34% ± 4%, 6192 ± 1747 IU·L(-1), 66 ± 5 mm). The 10 MVC-ISO group showed smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following eccentric contractions compared with the 2 MVC-ISO group. Therefore, two MVC-ISO conferred potent protective effects against muscle damage, whereas greater protective effect was induced by 10 MVC-ISO, which can be used as a strategy to minimize muscle damage.",

The Exp group performed six sets of ten low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors on a leg extension machine by lowering a weight of 10 % maximal voluntary isometric knee extension strength (10 %ECC) 7 days prior to MaxECC. Changes in maximal voluntary isokinetic concentric torque (MVC-CON), angle at peak torque, range of motion (ROM), upper thigh circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin (Mb) concentration and B-mode ultrasound echo-intensity before and for 5 days after MaxECC were compared between groups by a mixed factor ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were observed following 10 %ECC. Following MaxECC, all variables changed significantly, and changes in all variables except for angle at peak torque were significantly different between groups. MVC-CON and ROM decreased smaller and recovered faster (P < 0.05) for Exp than control group, and changes in other variables were smaller (P < 0.05) for Exp group compared with control group. These results suggest that preconditioning knee extensor muscles with low-intensity eccentric contractions was effective for attenuating muscle damage induced by subsequent MaxECC of the knee extensors for elderly individuals.",
      "# Title: Effect of two maximal isometric contractions on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the elbow flexors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the time wise protective effect conferred by two maximal voluntary isometric contractions (2MVCs) at 20° elbow flexion on muscle damage induced by 30 maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors (MaxECC). Sixty-five young untrained men were randomly assigned to a control group that did not perform 2MVCs, or one of four experimental groups (n = 13 per group) who performed 2MVCs either immediately (0d), 2 (2d), 4 (4d) or 7 days (7d) before MaxECC. Changes in maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) concentric torque (MVC-CON), optimum angle (OA), range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following MaxECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were evident following 2MVCs. The 2d and 4d groups showed 16-62 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following MaxECC than the control, 0d and 7d groups. The 2d group showed 14-34 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables except for OA compared with the 4d group. The changes in the variables were similar among the control, 0d and 7d groups. These results show that 2MVCs that were performed between 2 and 4 days before MaxECC attenuated the magnitude of muscle damage, but no such effect was evident if the 2MVCs were performed immediately or 7 days before MaxECC. It is concluded that the protective effect conferred by 2MVCs is relatively short-lived, and there is a window for the effect to be conferred.",
      "# Title: Effect of a prior bout of preconditioning exercise on muscle damage from downhill walking.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether reduced-duration downhill walking (DW) would confer a protective effect against muscle damage induced by a subsequent bout of longer duration DW performed 1 week or 4 weeks later. Healthy young adults were allocated to a control or one of the preconditioning exercise (PRE-1wk or PRE-4wk) groups (10 men and 4 women per group). PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups performed 20-min DW (-28% slope, 5 km/h, 10% body mass added to a backpack) 1 week and 4 weeks before 40-min DW, respectively, and the control group performed 40-min DW only. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) knee extension torque, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity, and muscle soreness (100-mm visual analog scale) were measured before, immediately after, and 24, 48, and 72 h after DW, and the changes in these variables were compared among groups. The control group showed symptoms of muscle damage (e.g., prolonged decrease in MVC: -14% ± 10% at 48 h post-DW) after 40-min DW. Changes in all variables after 40-min DW of PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups were 54%-61% smaller (P < 0.05) than the control group, without significant differences between PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups for MVC and plasma CK activity. Importantly, changes after the preconditioning exercise (20-min DW) were 67%-69% smaller (P < 0.05) than those after the 40-min DW of the control group. These findings suggest that 20-min DW resulting in minor muscle damage conferred a protective effect against subsequent 40-min DW, and its effect could last for more than 4 weeks.",

      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors and flexors protect against muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the magnitude and duration of the protective effect of low-intensity eccentric contractions (LowEC) against damage induced by maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) of the knee flexors (KF) and extensors (KE). Young men were assigned to 8 experimental groups and 2 control groups (n = 13/group); the experimental groups performed LowEC of KF or KE 2 days (2d), 1 week (1wk), 2 weeks (2wk), or 3 weeks (3wk) before MaxEC, while the control groups performed MaxEC of KF or KE without LowEC. The 2d, 1wk, 2wk, and 3wk groups performed 30 LowEC of KF or 60 LowEC of KE with a load of 10% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction strength on a resistance-training machine, and all groups performed 30 MaxEC of KF or 60 MaxEC of KE on an isokinetic dynamometer. Several muscle damage markers were measured from before to 2 days after exercise (LowEC) or from before to 5 days after exercise (MaxEC). No significant changes in any variables were evident after LowEC. The changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2d and 1wk groups (e.g., peak creatine kinase activity: 1002 ± 501 IU/L; peak muscle soreness: 13 ± 5 mm) than for the control group (peak creatine kinase activity: 3005 ± 983 IU/L; peak muscle soreness 28 ± 6 mm) for both KE and KF. There were no significant differences between the 2d and 1wk groups or among the 2wk, 3wk, and control groups. These results show that LowEC provided 30%-66% protection against damage induced by MaxEC of KF and KE, and the protective effect lasted 1 week.",
      "# Title: Protective effect by maximal isometric contractions against maximal eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the knee extensors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) performed before maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) would attenuate muscle damage of the knee extensors. Untrained men were placed to an experimental group that performed 6 sets of 10 MVIC at 90° knee flexion 2 weeks before 6 sets of 10 MaxEC or a control group that performed MaxEC only (n = 13/group). Changes in muscle damage markers were assessed before to 5 days after each exercise. Small but significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction torque, range of motion (ROM) and plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity were evident at immediately to 2 days post-MVIC (p < 0.05), but other variables (e.g. thigh girth, myoglobin concentration, B-mode echo intensity) did not change significantly. Changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (p < 0.05) by 45% (soreness)-67% (CK) for the experimental than the control group. These results suggest that MVIC conferred potent protective effect against MaxEC-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Prevention of downhill walking-induced muscle damage by non-damaging downhill walking.\n# Abstract: Mountain trekking involves level, uphill, and downhill walking (DW). Prolonged DW induces damage to leg muscles, reducing force generating ability and muscle coordination. These increase risks for more serious injuries and accidents in mountain trekking, thus a strategy to minimize muscle damage is warranted. It has been shown that low-intensity eccentric contractions confer protective effect on muscle damage induced by high-intensity eccentric contractions. This study tested the hypothesis that 5-min non-damaging DW would attenuate muscle damage induced by 40-min DW, but 5-min level walking (LW) would not.",
      "# Title: Isometric pre-conditioning blunts exercise-induced muscle damage but does not attenuate changes in running economy following downhill running.\n# Abstract: Running economy (RE) is impaired following unaccustomed eccentric-biased exercises that induce muscle damage. It is also known that muscle damage is reduced when maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) are performed at a long muscle length 2-4 days prior to maximal eccentric exercise with the same muscle, a phenomenon that can be described as isometric pre-conditioning (IPC). We tested the hypothesis that IPC could attenuate muscle damage and changes in RE following downhill running. Thirty untrained men were randomly assigned into experimental or control groups and ran downhill on a treadmill (-15%) for 30 min. Participants in the experimental group completed 10 MVIC in a leg press machine two days prior to downhill running, while participants in the control group did not perform IPC. The magnitude of changes in muscle soreness determined 48 h after downhill running was greater for the control group (122 ± 28 mm) than for the experimental group (92 ± 38 mm). Isometric peak torque recovered faster in the experimental group compared with the control group (3 days vs. no full recovery, respectively). No significant effect of IPC was found for countermovement jump height, serum creatine kinase activity or any parameters associated with RE. These results supported the hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in markers of muscle damage. The hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in RE was not supported by our data. It appears that the mechanisms involved in changes in markers of muscle damage and parameters associated with RE following downhill running are not completely shared.",

However, it is not known whether this strategy could be applied to other muscles. This study investigated whether 10% EC would confer damage protective effect on high-intensity eccentric contractions (80% EC) for nine different muscle groups.",
      "# Title: Protective Effect Conferred by Isometric Preconditioning Against Slow- and Fast-Velocity Eccentric Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage.\n# Abstract: We investigated if the same isometric preconditioning protocol (IPP) attenuates the magnitude of muscle damage induced by different maximal eccentric exercise protocols in the elbow flexors. Sixty-four untrained men were assigned to either two experimental or two control groups. Participants in the experimental groups performed an IPP prior to either slow (60°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-S) or fast (180°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-F) maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC). Subjects in the control groups performed slow (ECC-S) or fast (ECC-F) MaxECC without IPP. Maximal isokinetic concentric torque (MVC), muscle soreness (SOR), and muscle thickness (MT) were assessed before, immediately after, and 1-4 days following the MaxECC. Significant (p < 0.05) group vs. time interactions were found for MVC (F = 4,517), SOR (F = 6,318), and MT (F = 1,863). The ECC-S group presented faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and MT and less (p < 0.05) SOR at 96 h post-MaxECC compared with ECC-F group. No significant differences in MVC and MT were found between ECC-S and ECC-F groups following MaxECC. The ISO + ECC-S group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and SOR compared to the ECC-S group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ECC-S in any variable. The ISO + ECC-F group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of all assessed variables compared with the ECC-F group. MVC was greater (p < 0.05) at 48-72 h, and SOR was less (p < 0.05) at 48-96 h in the ISO + ECC-F compared to the ECC-F group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ISO + ECC-F for any variable. These results show that the IPP accelerated recovery of MVC and SOR for the slow-eccentric exercise condition and attenuated strength loss and SOR in addition to faster recovery of all assessed variables for the fast-eccentric exercise condition. Therefore, the IPP can be used as a strategy to attenuate and accelerate recovery of muscle damage induced by different-velocity eccentric exercises, resulting in greater protection against muscle damage induced by faster velocity."

      "conclusionA": "Performing a prior bout of low-to-moderate volume eccentric or isometric exercise—even as little as two maximal isometric contractions or 10-50 eccentric actions—significantly attenuates subsequent exercise-induced muscle damage, typically within a window of 1-2 weeks, regardless of exercise modality (downhill walking, elbow flexors, knee extensors) or contraction velocity; however, this protective effect is not sustained beyond 2-3 weeks.",

A total of 80 patients with acute cerebral infarction who were treated at our hospital were randomly selected. They were divided into groups A and B. The two groups were treated with intravenous thrombolysis, while group B received sub-hypothermia treatment. Prior to treatment and at 7 days after treatment, 5 ml of venous blood was collected and stored in a freezer at -80˚C. IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 levels were detected by ELISA and compared between the groups and time-points. The results were as follows: i) At 7 days after treatment, the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in group B were significantly decreased compared with those in group A (P<0.05), while there was no significant difference of these levels between group A and B before treatment (P>0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions in group A and group B was 35 and 20% respectively, and the mortality rate was 10 and 5%, respectively. There were no significant differences in adverse events and mortality between the two groups (P>0.05). In addition, a positive correlation of the level of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was determined in the patients prior to treatment. In conclusion, mild hypothermia treatment in addition to intravenous thrombolysis significantly reduced the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in patients with acute cerebral infarction and reduced inflammation, and should therefore be incorporated in clinical practice.",

      "# Title: Lymph node metastasis is mediated by suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 in gastric cancer.\n# Abstract: Suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3), a multifunctional cytokine, is able to inhibit cell growth and migration by blocking the Janus kinase signal transducers and activators of transcription signaling (JAK/STAT) activation in oncogenesis. Although the STAT-3 expression was associated with lymph node metastasis from gastric cancer (GC), the implication of SOCS-3 expression in GC is not clearly elucidated. In this study, SOCS-3, STAT-3, and pSTAT-3 were evaluated in GC tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues of 107 patients who underwent curative surgery by immunohistochemistry. Further, SOCS-3 and STAT-3 mRNA levels were also detected simultaneously. In addition, survival analysis was performed between clinicopathologic variables and prognosis of GC patients. Finally, correlative analysis was adopted for demonstration the best predicator of the survival independent factor. From the results, we demonstrated that only the lymph node metastasis was the independent predictor of the overall survival (OS) of GC patients, although SOCS-3, STAT-3, and other variables were significantly relative to OS. With multivariate logistical regression analysis, SOCS-3, STAT-3, and the status of extragastric nodal metastasis were identified to be the independent factors of the lymph node metastasis from GC. Ultimately, the SOCS-3 was the best predicator of lymph node metastasis from GC identified with the nominal regression analysis. Therefore, SOCS-3 should be considered as a potential indicator for prediction the lymph node metastasis from GC.",

Although tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3, also known as A20) can decrease SOCS3 expression and is involved in the regulation of tumorigenesis in certain malignancies, its role in CCA remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression of SOCS3 and A20 in human CCA tissues to assess the prognostic significance of these proteins. The expression of SOCS3 and A20 was initially detected by western blot in 22 cases of freshly frozen CCA tumors with corresponding peritumoral tissues and 22 control normal bile duct tissues. Then, these proteins were investigated in 86 CCA patients by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and were evaluated for their association with clinicopathological parameters in human CCA. The results indicated that SOCS3 expression was significantly lower in CCA tumor tissues than in corresponding peritumoral biliary tissues and normal bile duct tissues. Conversely, A20 was overexpressed in CCA tissues. Thus, an inverse correlation between the expression of SOCS3 and A20 was discovered. Furthermore, patients with low SOCS3 expression or high A20 expression showed a dramatically lower overall survival rate. These proteins were both associated with CCA lymph node metastasis, postoperative recurrence and overall survival rate. However, only A20 showed a significant association with the tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage, while SOCS3 showed a significant association with tumor differentiation. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that SOCS3 and A20 were independent prognostic indicators for overall survival in CCA. Thus, our study demonstrated that SOCS3 and A20 represent novel prognostic factors for human CCA.",

However, aberrant expression of BORIS is observed in various carcinomas, indicating a malignant role for this protein. Furthermore, abolishment or reduction of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) expression directed by promoter methylation is considered significant in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) carcinogenesis. This study aims to investigate BORIS and SOCS3 expression in HCC specimens and assess the prognostic significance of these proteins.BORIS and SOCS3 expression was examined using immunohistochemistry in HCC tissues, along with corresponding paracarcinomatous, cirrhosis, hepatitis, and normal liver tissues. The expression levels of these 2 proteins in HCC were evaluated for their association with clinicopathological parameters. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves, the log-rank test, and multivariate Cox regression analysis.BORIS expression was significantly higher in HCC tissues than in normal liver tissues. In contrast, SOCS3 expression was dramatically lower in HCC tissues. BORIS expression was associated with tumor size, differentiation grade, satellite lesions, and recurrence while SOCS3 expression correlated with differentiation grade, vascular invasion, and recurrence. A significant negative correlation between BORIS and SOCS3 was observed. Patients with high BORIS expression and/or low SOCS3 expression had poorer postoperative survival. Patients with both these characteristics had the poorest prognostic outcome.BORIS and SOCS3 are promising as valuable indicators for predicting HCC prognosis.",

      "# Title: Prognostic significance of SOCS3 and its biological function in colorectal cancer.\n# Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignant tumor, in which the inflammatory microenvironment plays an important role. STAT3 signaling pathway is regarded as the \"bridge\" between inflammation and cancer, and involved in the development of CRC. SOCS3 is a key negative feedback regulator of JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Studies about SOCS3 gene in CRC are rarely reported. The purpose of this study is to determine the expression of SOCS3 in CRC tissue and its correlation with the clinical pathological characteristics and prognosis of colorectal cancers. The effects of SOCS3 on biological behavior such as apoptosis, proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor formation in nude mice were studied. We observed that SOCS3 expression was down-regulated in CRC tissues, while IL-6, pSTAT3 were up-regulated. Inflammatory cytokines IL-6 can promote the expression of STAT3 signaling pathways while inhibit the expression of SOCS3 by promoting hypermethylation of SOCS3 gene promoters. 5-Aza-cdR treatment can reverse IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway mediated down-regulation of SOCS3 in colorectal cancer cells. Low expression of SOCS3 was correlated with lymph node metastasis and advanced clinical stage. Patients with high expression of SOCS3 in colorectal cancers often indicated a relatively good prognosis. Overexpression of SOCS3 inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion and tumorigenic ability of CRC cells while increased cell apoptosis. This study demonstrated that IL-6/STAT3 signaling activation negatively regulated SOCS3 expression, which led to imbalance and sustained activation of STAT3 signaling pathway. Reduced expression of SOCS3 promoted the growth and metastasis of colorectal cancer. Thus, targeting IL-6/STAT3/SOCS3 signaling pathway may become an important treatment strategy of colorectal cancer.",

Methods: We assessed the expression of PD-L1, CD276, SOCS3, CD4 and CD8 by immunohistochemistry in tumor tissue from 74 HCC patients who underwent curative hepatectomy. Results: High expression of PD-L1 was significantly associated with high Edmondson grade (p<0.01) and elevated enzyme (p=0.037); high expression of CD276 was significantly correlated with high Edmondson grade (p=0.021); high expression of SOCS3 was significantly associated with age (p=0.026) and tumor size (p=0.041), while PD-L1 showed no significant correlation. The expression of PD-L1, CD276, SOCS3 protein and other clinicopathological factors (sex, vascular invasion, tumor number, tumor capsule, pT stage, liver cirrhosis, HBsAg, TBiL, AFP) showed no significant correlation (p>0.05). High expression of CD8 was respectively significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS) (p=0.002). There was no significantly difference between CD4 and CD8 high-expression and overall survival (OS) (p=0.100). Both high expression of PD-L1 (p=0.003) and low expression of SOCS3 (p=0.015) was significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS). But CD276 only had a trendency (p=0.166). Additionally, multivariate Cox regression models implied that PD-L1, SOCS3, as well as both CD4 and CD8 was an independent prognostic factor for OS (p<0.05). Furthermore, HCC patients with PD-L1 low-expression and SOCS3 high-expression had a better prognostic according to the different pT stages (p<0.05). Conclusions: We for the first time demonstrated that PD-L1 and SOCS3 were independent prognostic factor for HCC patients. Co-expression of low PD-L1 and high SOCS3 could be a better predictive marker for HCC patients."

      "conclusionA": "**Primary Concluding Statement:**\n\nAcross various solid tumors, the prognostic significance of SOCS3 expression is markedly variable and significantly moderated by clinicopathological characteristics. While high SOCS3 expression often correlates with improved survival in early-stage, low-grade, localized tumors, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role, it frequently associates with poorer outcomes in advanced-stage, high-grade, or metastatic disease, indicating a potential pro-tumorigenic or adaptive function in established malignancy.\n",
      "conclusionB": "**Primary Concluding Statement:**\n\nIn patients with solid tumors, including breast, gastric, cholangiocarcinoma, prostate, hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal, and ovarian cancers, low expression of SOCS3 is significantly associated with poor prognosis and increased risk of adverse outcomes such as recurrence, lymph node metastasis, and reduced overall survival."

      "# Title: Accuracy of real-time shear wave elastography for assessing liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C: a pilot study.\n# Abstract: Real-time shear wave elastography (SWE) is a novel, noninvasive method to assess liver fibrosis by measuring liver stiffness. This single-center study was conducted to assess the accuracy of SWE in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), in comparison with transient elastography (TE), by using liver biopsy (LB) as the reference standard. Consecutive patients with CHC scheduled for LB by referring physicians were studied. One hundred and twenty-one patients met inclusion criteria. On the same day, real-time SWE using the ultrasound (US) system, Aixplorer (SuperSonic Imagine S.A., Aix-en-Provence, France), TE using FibroScan (Echosens, Paris, France), and US-assisted LB were consecutively performed. Fibrosis was staged according to the METAVIR scoring system. Analyses of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were performed to calculate optimal area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for F0-F1 versus F2-F4, F0- F2 versus F3-F4, and F0-F3 versus F4 for both real-time SWE and TE. Liver stiffness values increased in parallel with degree of liver fibrosis, both with SWE and TE. AUROCs were 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-0.96) for SWE and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.76-0.90) for TE (P = 0.002), 0.98 (95% CI: 0.94-1.00) for SWE and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.90-0.99) for TE (P = 0.14), and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.93-1.00) for SWE and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.91-0.99) for TE (P = 0.48), when comparing F0-F1 versus F2- F4, F0- F2 versus F3-F4, and F0 -F3 versus F4, respectively.",

Intra- and inter-operator reliability and repeatability were quantified in three different liver segments in a sample of 15 subjects, scanned during four independent sessions (two scans on day 1, two scans 1 wk later) by two operators. A total of 1440 measurements were made. Reproducibility was assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and a repeated measures analysis of variance. The shear wave speed was measured and used to estimate Young's modulus using the Supersonics Imagine Aixplorer. The median Young's modulus measured through the inter-costal space was 5.55 ± 0.74 kPa. The intra-operator reliability was better for same-day evaluations (ICC = 0.91) than the inter-operator reliability (ICC = 0.78). Intra-observer agreement decreased when scans were repeated on a different day. Inter-session repeatability was between 3.3% and 9.9% for intra-day repeated scans, compared with to 6.5%-12% for inter-day repeated scans. No significant difference was observed in subjects with a body mass index greater or less than 25 kg/m(2).",

With this index, the intra-observer acquisition variability assessed by comparing consecutive scans of the same patient was 17% and 32% for HG and LG clips, respectively. The measurement quantification variability assessed by comparing the measurements of a radiologist with those of a trained operator and of two automatic measurements on a same clip averaged 13% and 22% for HG and LG exams, respectively. It was found that SWE measurements depend greatly on the quality of the acquired data.

The rate of reliable liver stiffness measurements was significantly higher with 2-D SWE than with TE: 99.2% versus 74.8%, p < 0.0001 (different reliability criteria used, according to current recommendations). In univariate analysis, liver stiffness measured with 2-D SWE correlated best with fibrosis stage estimated with TE (r = 0.699, p < 0.0001), followed by Forns score (r = 0.534, p < 0.0001) and King's score (r = 0.512, p < 0.0001). However, in multivariate analysis, only 2-D SWE-measured values remained correlated with fibrosis stage (p < 0.0001). The optimal 2-D SWE cutoff values for predicting significant fibrosis were 8.03 kPa for fibrosis stage ≥2 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.832) and 13.1 kPa for fibrosis stage 4 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.915), respectively. In conclusion, 2-D SWE can be used to obtain reliable liver stiffness measurements in almost all patients and performs very well in predicting the presence of liver cirrhosis.",
      "# Title: Assessment of liver fibrosis with 2-D shear wave elastography in comparison to transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse imaging in patients with chronic liver disease.\n# Abstract: Two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2-D SWE) is an ultrasound-based elastography method integrated into a conventional ultrasound machine. It can evaluate larger regions of interest and, therefore, might be better at determining the overall fibrosis distribution. The aim of this prospective study was to compare 2-D SWE with the two best evaluated liver elastography methods, transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse (point SWE using acoustic radiation force impulse) imaging, in the same population group. The study included 132 patients with chronic hepatopathies, in which liver stiffness was evaluated using transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging and 2-D SWE. The reference methods were liver biopsy for the assessment of liver fibrosis (n = 101) and magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography for the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis (n = 31). No significant difference in diagnostic accuracy, assessed as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), was found between the three elastography methods (2-D SWE, transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging) for the diagnosis of significant and advanced fibrosis and liver cirrhosis in the \"per protocol\" (AUROCs for fibrosis stages ≥2: 0.90, 0.95 and 0.91; for fibrosis stage [F] ≥3: 0.93, 0.95 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.92, 0.96 and 0.92) and \"intention to diagnose\" cohort (AUROCs for F ≥2: 0.87, 0.92 and 0.91; for F ≥3: 0.91, 0.93 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.88, 0.90 and 0.89). Therefore, 2-D SWE, ARFI imaging and transient elastography seem to be comparably good methods for non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis.",

The goal of this study was to assess the clinical use of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) evaluated by supersonic shear imaging (SSI), FibroScan, and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) in a cohort of NAFLD patients who underwent liver biopsy. A total of 291 NAFLD patients were prospectively enrolled from November 2011 to February 2015 at 2 French university hospitals. LSM was assessed by SSI, FibroScan (M probe), and ARFI within two weeks prior to liver biopsy. Calculations of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) were performed and compared for the staging of liver fibrosis. AUROC for SSI, FibroScan, and ARFI were 0.86, 0.82, and 0.77 for diagnoses of ≥F2; 0.89, 0.86, and 0.84 for ≥F3; and 0.88, 0.87, and 0.84 for F4, respectively. SSI had a higher accuracy than ARFI for diagnoses of significant fibrosis (≥F2) (P = 0.004). Clinical factors related to obesity such as body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2) , waist circumference ≥102 cm or increased parietal wall thickness were associated with LSM failures when using SSI or FibroScan and with unreliable results when using ARFI. In univariate analysis, FibroScan values were slightly correlated with NAFLD activity score and steatosis (R = 0.28 and 0.22, respectively), whereas SSI and ARFI were not; however, these components of NAFLD did not affect LSM results in multivariate analysis. The cutoff values for SSI and FibroScan for staging fibrosis with a sensitivity ≥90% were very close: 6.3/6.2 kPa for ≥F2, 8.3/8.2 kPa for ≥F3, and 10.5/9.5 kPa for F4.",

Patients with CHB infection who underwent liver biopsy were consecutively included. After exclusions, 257 patients were analyzed. Two-dimensional SWE resulted in a significantly higher rate of reliable measurements (98.1%, 252/257) than TE (93.0%, 239/257) (p = 0.011). Liver stiffness measurements of the two examinations exhibited a strong correlation (r = 0.835, p < 0.001).

The purpose of this study was to perform an intra-individual comparison between 2-D shear wave elastography (2-D-SWE with a GE system) and Virtual Touch Tissue Quantification (VTTQ with a Siemens system) to assess whether these can be used interchangeably to grade fibrosis. Ninety-three patients (51 men, 42 women; mean age, 54 y) with liver disease of various etiologies (hepatitis B virus = 47, hepatitis C virus = 22; alcohol = 6, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis = 5, other = 13) were included. Using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values, liver fibrosis was classified into clinically non-significant (F0/F1) and significant (≥F2) fibrosis. Results indicated that intra-modality repeatability was excellent for both techniques (GE 2-D-SWE: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.89 [0.84-0.93]; VTTQ: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.90 [0.86-0.93]). Intra-modality classification agreement for fibrosis grading was good to excellent (GE 2-D-SWE: κ = 0.65, VTTQ: κ = 0.82). However, inter-modality agreement for fibrosis grading was only fair (κ = 0.31) using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values of fibrosis.

    "referenceConclusion": "Pre-conditioning significantly reduced the severity of creatine kinase release, delayed-onset muscle soreness, loss of maximal voluntary contraction force and the range of motion decrease. Pre-conditioning may prevent severe EIMD and accelerate recovery of muscle force generation capacity. The current systematic review identified that pre-conditioning activities are effective in attenuating EIMD measures, CK, muscle soreness, ROM and maximal voluntary force production. These findings suggest the use of pre-conditioning activities prior to a strenuous bout of exercise does provide a significant protective effect when performed a minimum of 24 h prior to the damaging stimulus. Furthermore, the greater improvement in MVC suggests that the pre-conditioning activities may accelerate the recovery of muscle contractile properties following strenuous exercises. However, it is unclear if pre-conditioning would prevent EIMD from more complex exercises or to what extent EIMD prevention carries over into other modes of exercise.",

      "# Title: Muscle tenderness and peak torque changes after downhill running following a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: Unaccustomed exercise (usually of an eccentric nature) is often followed by delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Previous studies have found that prior eccentric activity produces a training effect which reduces DOMS and morphological changes. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a prior bout of maximal isokinetic eccentric exercise on DOMS, strength loss and plasma creatine kinase (CK) changes following a downhill run. Ten male subjects with a mean (+/- S.D.) age of 22.5 +/- 2.8 years, body mass of 62.67 +/- 0.05 kg and height of 176 +/- 3 cm were allocated to either a treatment group or a control group. The treatment group performed 100 maximal eccentric activations of the knee extensors in the dominant leg at 0.52 rad s-1. Two weeks later, the downhill run was performed on a motor-driven treadmill. This consisted of five bouts of 8 min at a gradient of -10% at a speed corresponding to 80% of the predicted maximal heart rate. The untrained group performed the downhill run as above but without the prior isokinetic session. Tenderness measurements, plasma CK activity and concentric and eccentric isokinetic peak torque measurements of the knee extensors at 0.52 and 2.83 rad s-1 were recorded prior to, immediately following and 2, 4 and 7 days after each protocol. The isokinetic protocol caused an increase (P < 0.01) in CK and tenderness and a decrease (P < 0.05) in concentric and eccentric torque at both speeds in the treatment group. Following the downhill run, a reduction in peak torque (P < 0.01) was observed in the eccentric and concentric modes at both isokinetic speeds in the control group. For the treatment group, the decrease in peak torque occurred only at the faster eccentric speed. With the exception of the faster eccentric speed, the decrement in peak torque was greater in the control group in all post-exercise isokinetic strength tests. There was less tenderness (P < 0.01) in the trained knee extensor muscle group. Peak torque also returned to pre-downhill values earlier for the trained group. Although plasma CK activity increased in both groups after downhill running, it was much lower (P < 0.01) in the trained group. The results suggest that a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric training reduces muscle damage, reduces the amount of strength loss and decreases the sensation of DOMS after downhill running.",
      "# Title: Exercise-induced skeletal muscle damage and adaptation following repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions.\n# Abstract: Repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions were used to examine indirect indices of exercise-induced muscle damage and adaptation in human skeletal muscle. Twenty-four subjects (18 females, 6 males) aged 20.0 +/- 1.4 years (mean +/- S.D.) performed an initial bout of either 10 (n = 7), 30 (n = 9) or 50 (n = 8) maximum voluntary eccentric contractions of the knee extensors, followed by a second bout of 50 contractions 3 weeks later using the same leg. Muscle soreness was elevated after all bouts (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon test), although the initial bout reduced the soreness associated with the second bout. Force loss and a decline in the 20:100 Hz percutaneous electrical myostimulation force ratio were observed after all exercise bouts (P < 0.01). Serum creatine kinase activity was elevated following the initial bouts of 30 and 50 repetitions (P < 0.01), but there was no increase following 10 repetitions. No increase in serum creatine kinase activity was observed in any group following the second bout of contractions (P > 0.05). We conclude that skeletal muscle adaptation can be brought about by a single bout of relatively few eccentric muscle contractions. Increasing the number of eccentric muscle repetitions did not result in an increased prophylactic effect on skeletal muscle.",
      "# Title: Influence of previous concentric exercise on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether a fatiguing concentric exercise performed immediately before eccentric exercise would exacerbate eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. One arm of nine female subjects (mean +/- s: 23.3 +/- 6.7 years) performed 12 maximal eccentric actions of the elbow flexors (ECC), and the other arm performed 100 repetitions of isokinetic concentric actions of the elbow flexors followed by the same eccentric exercise (CON-ECC). The two exercise regimens (ECC and CON-ECC) were separated by 2 weeks and presented in a counterbalanced order. Changes in muscle soreness level, maximal isometric force generation, relaxed and flexed elbow joint angle, upper arm circumference and plasma creatine kinase activity were compared between the ECC and CON-ECC conditions. All measures changed significantly after both ECC and CON-ECC; however, there were significant differences in the changes between the conditions. A lower level of soreness, a faster recovery of maximal isometric force generation, a smaller decrease in relaxed elbow joint angle and a smaller increase in upper arm circumference and creatine kinase activity were evident after the CON-ECC condition compared to the ECC condition. Thus, it would seem that muscle damage was attenuated by performance of previous concentric exercise. An additional experiment using a different group of subjects (n = 5) showed that warm-up exercise before the eccentric exercise also attenuated eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Acute adaptation to low volume eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: Many symptoms of eccentric muscle damage can be substantially reduced if a similar eccentric bout is repeated within several weeks of the initial bout. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a nondamaging, low repetition, low volume eccentric exercise bout could also provide a protective/adaptive effect.",
      "# Title: The repeated bout effect of reduced-load eccentric exercise on elbow flexor muscle damage.\n# Abstract: In this study we investigated the extent to which an initial eccentric exercise consisting of two (2ECC) or six maximal eccentric actions (6ECC) of the elbow flexors would produce a similar effect to 24 maximal eccentric actions (24ECC), on a second bout of 24ECC performed 2 weeks later. Male students (n = 34) were assigned to one of three groups, and with their non-dominant arm performed either 2ECC (n = 12), 6ECC (n = 10), or 24ECC (n = 12) as a first bout of exercise. Two weeks later all groups performed 24ECC. Maximal isometric strength, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration were assessed before, immediately after, and for 4 days after exercise. Changes in all variables were compared between the bouts and groups by a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance. All variables changed significantly (P< 0.05) after 2ECC, 6ECC, and 24ECC, but the amount of change after 2ECC and 6ECC was significantly smaller (P<0.05) than both 6ECC and 24ECC, and 24ECC, respectively. After the second bout, the 6ECC and 24ECC groups showed a profound repeated bout effect, and no significant differences were found between the groups. All variables except muscle soreness were significantly (P< 0.05) larger after the second bout for the 2ECC group, however the changes observed after 24ECC were significantly smaller (P < 0.01) than those observed after the first 24ECC of the 24ECC group. These results suggest that it is not necessary to conduct a high number of eccentric actions in the first bout to elicit a repeated bout effect in a subsequent bout performed some time later.",

      "# Title: Intensity of eccentric exercise, shift of optimum angle, and the magnitude of repeated-bout effect.\n# Abstract: This study compared the effect of four different intensities of initial eccentric exercise (ECC1) on optimum angle shift and extent of muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise. Fifty-two male students were placed into 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% groups (n = 13 per group), performing 30 eccentric actions of the elbow flexors of 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% of maximal isometric strength [maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)] for ECC1, followed 2-3 wk later by a similar exercise (ECC2) that used 100% MVC load. MVC at six elbow joint angles, range of motion, upper arm circumference, serum creatine kinase activity, myoglobin concentration, and muscle soreness were measured before and for 5 days following ECC1 and ECC2. A rightward shift of optimum angle following ECC1 was significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 100% and 80% than for the 60% and 40% groups, and it decreased significantly (P < 0.05) from immediately to 5 days postexercise. By the time ECC2 was performed, only the 100% group kept a significant shift (4 degrees). Changes in most of the criterion measures following ECC1 were significantly greater for the 100% and 80% groups compared with the 60% and 40% groups. Changes in the criterion measures following ECC2 were significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 40% group compared with other groups. Although the magnitude of repeated bout effect following ECC2 was significantly (P < 0.05) smaller for the 40% and 60% groups, all groups showed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced changes in criterion measures following ECC2 compared with the ECC1 100% bout. We conclude that the repeated-bout effect was not dependent on the shift of optimum angle.",
      "# Title: Repeated bout effect after maximal eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: We hypothesized that a bout of high or low volume eccentric exercise would protect against muscle damage following a subsequent high volume bout and that adaptation would be attributable to neural changes, independent of the initial exercise volume. Sixteen males performed either 45 (ECC45) or 10 (ECC10) maximal eccentric contractions using the elbow flexors, followed by an ECC45 bout 2 weeks later. Damage markers were measured for the following 96 h; EMG and work done during the first 10 eccentric contractions were also recorded. CK, soreness, and decrements in MVC and range of motion (ROM) were greater in bout 1 than bout 2 (p < 0.01). Soreness, MVC and ROM were greater after the initial ECC45 bout compared to the initial ECC10 bout and the repeated bouts of ECC45 exercise in both groups (p < 0.01). Median frequency decreased from bout 1 to bout 2 (p < 0.001), no differences between groups were observed. An ECC45 bout of maximal eccentric exercise causes more initial damage than an ECC10 bout of maximal eccentric exercise, although both confer protection from subsequent ECC45 bouts of maximal eccentric contractions, which are attributable, at least in part, to a shift in the frequency content of EMG.",
      "# Title: A light load eccentric exercise confers protection against a subsequent bout of more demanding eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that a light eccentric exercise (ECC) that does not induce a loss of muscle function and delayed onset muscle soreness would confer a protective effect against a more strenuous ECC. Eighteen young men were randomly placed into two groups: 10-40% (n=9) and 40% (n=9). Subjects in the 10-40% group performed ECC of the elbow flexors (six sets of five reps) using a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (MVC) at an elbow joint angle of 90 degrees , followed 2 days later by ECC using a dumbbell weight of 40% MVC. Subjects in the 40% group performed the 40% ECC only. Changes in MVC, range of motion (ROM), upper arm circumference (CIR), plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and muscle soreness before, immediately after, 1-5 and 7 days following the 40% ECC were compared between groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any of the criterion measures were found immediately and 1-2 days after the 10% ECC. Following the 40% ECC, the 10-40% group showed significantly (P<0.05) smaller decreases in MVC and ROM, and smaller increases in muscle soreness compared with the 40% group, but no significant differences between groups were evident for CIR and plasma CK activity. These results suggest that the 10% ECC induced some protection against a subsequent bout of 40% ECC performed 2 days later. It appears that the light eccentric exercise preconditioned the muscles for exposure to the subsequent damaging eccentric exercise bout.",
      "# Title: Protection against muscle damage following fifty drop jumps conferred by ten drop jumps.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether 10 drop jumps (DJs) would confer protective effect against muscle damage and soreness in a subsequent bout of 50 DJs. Sixteen men were randomly placed into either a group performing 1 set of 10 DJs followed by 5 sets of 10 DJs (10-50, n = 8) or another group performing 2 bouts of 5 sets of 10 DJs (50-50, n = 8) separated by 2 weeks. The DJs were performed from a box height of 0.6 m, with a 10-second interval between jumps and a 1-minute rest between sets. Jump height, peak vertical ground reaction force, ground contact time, and heart rate during DJs were measured, and blood lactate concentration was assessed before and immediately after DJs. Changes in maximal isometric (ISO) and isokinetic concentric torque (CON), vertical jump, muscle soreness, and plasma creatine kinase activity before, immediately after, and at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours following exercise were compared between groups for the first and second bouts and between the bouts by a 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance. Changes in ISO, CON, vertical jump, and muscle soreness were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller for 10 DJs compared with 50 DJs; however, no significant differences in the measures between groups were evident following the second bout. The changes in the measures following 50 DJs in the 10-50 group were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller than those following the first bout of the 50-50 group. These results suggest that 10 DJs and 50 DJs conferred the same magnitude of protective effect against muscle damage by 50 DJs.",
      "# Title: Muscle damage protection by low-intensity eccentric contractions remains for 2 weeks but not 3 weeks.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that the protective effect conferred by a low-intensity eccentric exercise against maximal eccentric exercise would not last more than a week. Untrained men (21.3 ± 1.6 years) were allocated into either a control or one of four repeated bout groups (n = 13 per group). The repeated bout groups performed 30 low-intensity eccentric contractions (ECC) of the elbow flexors with a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (10%-ECC) either 2 days, 7 days (1 week), 14 days (2 weeks) or 21 days (3 weeks) before 30 maximal eccentric contractions (Max-ECC). The control group performed Max-ECC only. Changes in maximal voluntary contraction strength, optimum angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following 10%-ECC were analysed by a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Changes in the variables following Max-ECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. The 10%-ECC did not change any variables, showing no indication of muscle damage. The changes in all variables following Max-ECC were smaller (P < 0.05) for 2-day, 1- and 2-week groups than control group, without significant differences between 2-day and 1-week groups. The 2-week group showed greater (P < 0.05) changes in all variables compared with 2-day and 1-week groups. Changes in the variables were similar between 3-week and control groups, except for muscle soreness showing smaller (P < 0.05) changes for 3-week group. These results suggest that non-damaging eccentric exercise confers a protective effect against Max-Ecc, but the effect is attenuated between 1 and 2 weeks.",
      "# Title: Two maximal isometric contractions attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVC-ISO) would attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. Young untrained men were placed into one of the two experimental groups or one control group (n = 13 per group). Subjects in the experimental groups performed either two or 10 MVC-ISO of the elbow flexors at a long muscle length (20° flexion) 2 days prior to 30 maximal isokinetic eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors. Subjects in the control group performed the eccentric contractions without MVC-ISO. No significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction peak torque, peak torque angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and myoglobin concentration, muscle soreness, and ultrasound echo intensity were evident after MVC-ISO. Changes in the variables following eccentric contractions were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2 MVC-ISO group (e.g., peak torque loss at 5 days after exercise, 23% ± 3%; peak CK activity, 1964 ± 452 IU·L(-1); peak muscle soreness, 46 ± 4 mm) or the 10 MVC-ISO group (13% ± 3%, 877 ± 198 IU·L(-1), 30 ± 4 mm) compared with the control (34% ± 4%, 6192 ± 1747 IU·L(-1), 66 ± 5 mm). The 10 MVC-ISO group showed smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following eccentric contractions compared with the 2 MVC-ISO group. Therefore, two MVC-ISO conferred potent protective effects against muscle damage, whereas greater protective effect was induced by 10 MVC-ISO, which can be used as a strategy to minimize muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Attenuation of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage by preconditioning exercises.\n# Abstract: This study compared the effect of an initial exercise consisting of either low-intensity eccentric or maximal isometric contractions (ISOs) on protective effect against maximal eccentric contraction (MaxECC)-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions attenuate muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise of the knee extensors in the elderly.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors would attenuate the magnitude of muscle damage induced by maximal eccentric exercise of the same muscle performed 7 days later using elderly individuals. Healthy older men (66.4 ± 4.6 years) were assigned to control or experimental (Exp) group (n = 13 per group). The control group performed six sets of ten maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC) of the knee extensors of non-dominant leg. The Exp group performed six sets of ten low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors on a leg extension machine by lowering a weight of 10 % maximal voluntary isometric knee extension strength (10 %ECC) 7 days prior to MaxECC. Changes in maximal voluntary isokinetic concentric torque (MVC-CON), angle at peak torque, range of motion (ROM), upper thigh circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin (Mb) concentration and B-mode ultrasound echo-intensity before and for 5 days after MaxECC were compared between groups by a mixed factor ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were observed following 10 %ECC. Following MaxECC, all variables changed significantly, and changes in all variables except for angle at peak torque were significantly different between groups. MVC-CON and ROM decreased smaller and recovered faster (P < 0.05) for Exp than control group, and changes in other variables were smaller (P < 0.05) for Exp group compared with control group. These results suggest that preconditioning knee extensor muscles with low-intensity eccentric contractions was effective for attenuating muscle damage induced by subsequent MaxECC of the knee extensors for elderly individuals.",
      "# Title: Effect of two maximal isometric contractions on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the elbow flexors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the time wise protective effect conferred by two maximal voluntary isometric contractions (2MVCs) at 20° elbow flexion on muscle damage induced by 30 maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors (MaxECC). Sixty-five young untrained men were randomly assigned to a control group that did not perform 2MVCs, or one of four experimental groups (n = 13 per group) who performed 2MVCs either immediately (0d), 2 (2d), 4 (4d) or 7 days (7d) before MaxECC. Changes in maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) concentric torque (MVC-CON), optimum angle (OA), range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following MaxECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were evident following 2MVCs. The 2d and 4d groups showed 16-62 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following MaxECC than the control, 0d and 7d groups. The 2d group showed 14-34 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables except for OA compared with the 4d group. The changes in the variables were similar among the control, 0d and 7d groups. These results show that 2MVCs that were performed between 2 and 4 days before MaxECC attenuated the magnitude of muscle damage, but no such effect was evident if the 2MVCs were performed immediately or 7 days before MaxECC. It is concluded that the protective effect conferred by 2MVCs is relatively short-lived, and there is a window for the effect to be conferred.",
      "# Title: Effect of a prior bout of preconditioning exercise on muscle damage from downhill walking.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether reduced-duration downhill walking (DW) would confer a protective effect against muscle damage induced by a subsequent bout of longer duration DW performed 1 week or 4 weeks later. Healthy young adults were allocated to a control or one of the preconditioning exercise (PRE-1wk or PRE-4wk) groups (10 men and 4 women per group). PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups performed 20-min DW (-28% slope, 5 km/h, 10% body mass added to a backpack) 1 week and 4 weeks before 40-min DW, respectively, and the control group performed 40-min DW only. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) knee extension torque, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity, and muscle soreness (100-mm visual analog scale) were measured before, immediately after, and 24, 48, and 72 h after DW, and the changes in these variables were compared among groups. The control group showed symptoms of muscle damage (e.g., prolonged decrease in MVC: -14% ± 10% at 48 h post-DW) after 40-min DW. Changes in all variables after 40-min DW of PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups were 54%-61% smaller (P < 0.05) than the control group, without significant differences between PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups for MVC and plasma CK activity. Importantly, changes after the preconditioning exercise (20-min DW) were 67%-69% smaller (P < 0.05) than those after the 40-min DW of the control group. These findings suggest that 20-min DW resulting in minor muscle damage conferred a protective effect against subsequent 40-min DW, and its effect could last for more than 4 weeks.",

      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors and flexors protect against muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the magnitude and duration of the protective effect of low-intensity eccentric contractions (LowEC) against damage induced by maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) of the knee flexors (KF) and extensors (KE). Young men were assigned to 8 experimental groups and 2 control groups (n = 13/group); the experimental groups performed LowEC of KF or KE 2 days (2d), 1 week (1wk), 2 weeks (2wk), or 3 weeks (3wk) before MaxEC, while the control groups performed MaxEC of KF or KE without LowEC. The 2d, 1wk, 2wk, and 3wk groups performed 30 LowEC of KF or 60 LowEC of KE with a load of 10% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction strength on a resistance-training machine, and all groups performed 30 MaxEC of KF or 60 MaxEC of KE on an isokinetic dynamometer. Several muscle damage markers were measured from before to 2 days after exercise (LowEC) or from before to 5 days after exercise (MaxEC). No significant changes in any variables were evident after LowEC. The changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2d and 1wk groups (e.g., peak creatine kinase activity: 1002 ± 501 IU/L; peak muscle soreness: 13 ± 5 mm) than for the control group (peak creatine kinase activity: 3005 ± 983 IU/L; peak muscle soreness 28 ± 6 mm) for both KE and KF. There were no significant differences between the 2d and 1wk groups or among the 2wk, 3wk, and control groups. These results show that LowEC provided 30%-66% protection against damage induced by MaxEC of KF and KE, and the protective effect lasted 1 week.",
      "# Title: Protective effect by maximal isometric contractions against maximal eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the knee extensors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) performed before maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) would attenuate muscle damage of the knee extensors. Untrained men were placed to an experimental group that performed 6 sets of 10 MVIC at 90° knee flexion 2 weeks before 6 sets of 10 MaxEC or a control group that performed MaxEC only (n = 13/group). Changes in muscle damage markers were assessed before to 5 days after each exercise. Small but significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction torque, range of motion (ROM) and plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity were evident at immediately to 2 days post-MVIC (p < 0.05), but other variables (e.g. thigh girth, myoglobin concentration, B-mode echo intensity) did not change significantly. Changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (p < 0.05) by 45% (soreness)-67% (CK) for the experimental than the control group. These results suggest that MVIC conferred potent protective effect against MaxEC-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Prevention of downhill walking-induced muscle damage by non-damaging downhill walking.\n# Abstract: Mountain trekking involves level, uphill, and downhill walking (DW). Prolonged DW induces damage to leg muscles, reducing force generating ability and muscle coordination. These increase risks for more serious injuries and accidents in mountain trekking, thus a strategy to minimize muscle damage is warranted. It has been shown that low-intensity eccentric contractions confer protective effect on muscle damage induced by high-intensity eccentric contractions. This study tested the hypothesis that 5-min non-damaging DW would attenuate muscle damage induced by 40-min DW, but 5-min level walking (LW) would not.",
      "# Title: Isometric pre-conditioning blunts exercise-induced muscle damage but does not attenuate changes in running economy following downhill running.\n# Abstract: Running economy (RE) is impaired following unaccustomed eccentric-biased exercises that induce muscle damage. It is also known that muscle damage is reduced when maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) are performed at a long muscle length 2-4 days prior to maximal eccentric exercise with the same muscle, a phenomenon that can be described as isometric pre-conditioning (IPC). We tested the hypothesis that IPC could attenuate muscle damage and changes in RE following downhill running. Thirty untrained men were randomly assigned into experimental or control groups and ran downhill on a treadmill (-15%) for 30 min. Participants in the experimental group completed 10 MVIC in a leg press machine two days prior to downhill running, while participants in the control group did not perform IPC. The magnitude of changes in muscle soreness determined 48 h after downhill running was greater for the control group (122 ± 28 mm) than for the experimental group (92 ± 38 mm). Isometric peak torque recovered faster in the experimental group compared with the control group (3 days vs. no full recovery, respectively). No significant effect of IPC was found for countermovement jump height, serum creatine kinase activity or any parameters associated with RE. These results supported the hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in markers of muscle damage. The hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in RE was not supported by our data. It appears that the mechanisms involved in changes in markers of muscle damage and parameters associated with RE following downhill running are not completely shared.",

However, it is not known whether this strategy could be applied to other muscles. This study investigated whether 10% EC would confer damage protective effect on high-intensity eccentric contractions (80% EC) for nine different muscle groups.",
      "# Title: Protective Effect Conferred by Isometric Preconditioning Against Slow- and Fast-Velocity Eccentric Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage.\n# Abstract: We investigated if the same isometric preconditioning protocol (IPP) attenuates the magnitude of muscle damage induced by different maximal eccentric exercise protocols in the elbow flexors. Sixty-four untrained men were assigned to either two experimental or two control groups. Participants in the experimental groups performed an IPP prior to either slow (60°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-S) or fast (180°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-F) maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC). Subjects in the control groups performed slow (ECC-S) or fast (ECC-F) MaxECC without IPP. Maximal isokinetic concentric torque (MVC), muscle soreness (SOR), and muscle thickness (MT) were assessed before, immediately after, and 1-4 days following the MaxECC. Significant (p < 0.05) group vs. time interactions were found for MVC (F = 4,517), SOR (F = 6,318), and MT (F = 1,863). The ECC-S group presented faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and MT and less (p < 0.05) SOR at 96 h post-MaxECC compared with ECC-F group. No significant differences in MVC and MT were found between ECC-S and ECC-F groups following MaxECC. The ISO + ECC-S group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and SOR compared to the ECC-S group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ECC-S in any variable. The ISO + ECC-F group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of all assessed variables compared with the ECC-F group. MVC was greater (p < 0.05) at 48-72 h, and SOR was less (p < 0.05) at 48-96 h in the ISO + ECC-F compared to the ECC-F group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ISO + ECC-F for any variable. These results show that the IPP accelerated recovery of MVC and SOR for the slow-eccentric exercise condition and attenuated strength loss and SOR in addition to faster recovery of all assessed variables for the fast-eccentric exercise condition. Therefore, the IPP can be used as a strategy to attenuate and accelerate recovery of muscle damage induced by different-velocity eccentric exercises, resulting in greater protection against muscle damage induced by faster velocity."

This single-center study was conducted to assess the accuracy of SWE in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), in comparison with transient elastography (TE), by using liver biopsy (LB) as the reference standard. Consecutive patients with CHC scheduled for LB by referring physicians were studied. One hundred and twenty-one patients met inclusion criteria. On the same day, real-time SWE using the ultrasound (US) system, Aixplorer (SuperSonic Imagine S.A., Aix-en-Provence, France), TE using FibroScan (Echosens, Paris, France), and US-assisted LB were consecutively performed. Fibrosis was staged according to the METAVIR scoring system. Analyses of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were performed to calculate optimal area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for F0-F1 versus F2-F4, F0- F2 versus F3-F4, and F0-F3 versus F4 for both real-time SWE and TE. Liver stiffness values increased in parallel with degree of liver fibrosis, both with SWE and TE.

Intra- and inter-operator reliability and repeatability were quantified in three different liver segments in a sample of 15 subjects, scanned during four independent sessions (two scans on day 1, two scans 1 wk later) by two operators. A total of 1440 measurements were made. Reproducibility was assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and a repeated measures analysis of variance. The shear wave speed was measured and used to estimate Young's modulus using the Supersonics Imagine Aixplorer. The median Young's modulus measured through the inter-costal space was 5.55 ± 0.74 kPa. The intra-operator reliability was better for same-day evaluations (ICC = 0.91) than the inter-operator reliability (ICC = 0.78). Intra-observer agreement decreased when scans were repeated on a different day. Inter-session repeatability was between 3.3% and 9.9% for intra-day repeated scans, compared with to 6.5%-12% for inter-day repeated scans. No significant difference was observed in subjects with a body mass index greater or less than 25 kg/m(2).",

With this index, the intra-observer acquisition variability assessed by comparing consecutive scans of the same patient was 17% and 32% for HG and LG clips, respectively. The measurement quantification variability assessed by comparing the measurements of a radiologist with those of a trained operator and of two automatic measurements on a same clip averaged 13% and 22% for HG and LG exams, respectively.

The rate of reliable liver stiffness measurements was significantly higher with 2-D SWE than with TE: 99.2% versus 74.8%, p < 0.0001 (different reliability criteria used, according to current recommendations). In univariate analysis, liver stiffness measured with 2-D SWE correlated best with fibrosis stage estimated with TE (r = 0.699, p < 0.0001), followed by Forns score (r = 0.534, p < 0.0001) and King's score (r = 0.512, p < 0.0001). However, in multivariate analysis, only 2-D SWE-measured values remained correlated with fibrosis stage (p < 0.0001). The optimal 2-D SWE cutoff values for predicting significant fibrosis were 8.03 kPa for fibrosis stage ≥2 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.832) and 13.1 kPa for fibrosis stage 4 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.915), respectively.

      "# Title: Assessment of liver fibrosis with 2-D shear wave elastography in comparison to transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse imaging in patients with chronic liver disease.\n# Abstract: Two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2-D SWE) is an ultrasound-based elastography method integrated into a conventional ultrasound machine. It can evaluate larger regions of interest and, therefore, might be better at determining the overall fibrosis distribution. The aim of this prospective study was to compare 2-D SWE with the two best evaluated liver elastography methods, transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse (point SWE using acoustic radiation force impulse) imaging, in the same population group. The study included 132 patients with chronic hepatopathies, in which liver stiffness was evaluated using transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging and 2-D SWE. The reference methods were liver biopsy for the assessment of liver fibrosis (n = 101) and magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography for the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis (n = 31). No significant difference in diagnostic accuracy, assessed as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), was found between the three elastography methods (2-D SWE, transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging) for the diagnosis of significant and advanced fibrosis and liver cirrhosis in the \"per protocol\" (AUROCs for fibrosis stages ≥2: 0.90, 0.95 and 0.91; for fibrosis stage [F] ≥3: 0.93, 0.95 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.92, 0.96 and 0.92) and \"intention to diagnose\" cohort (AUROCs for F ≥2: 0.87, 0.92 and 0.91; for F ≥3: 0.91, 0.93 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.88, 0.90 and 0.89).

The goal of this study was to assess the clinical use of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) evaluated by supersonic shear imaging (SSI), FibroScan, and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) in a cohort of NAFLD patients who underwent liver biopsy. A total of 291 NAFLD patients were prospectively enrolled from November 2011 to February 2015 at 2 French university hospitals. LSM was assessed by SSI, FibroScan (M probe), and ARFI within two weeks prior to liver biopsy. Calculations of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) were performed and compared for the staging of liver fibrosis. AUROC for SSI, FibroScan, and ARFI were 0.86, 0.82, and 0.77 for diagnoses of ≥F2; 0.89, 0.86, and 0.84 for ≥F3; and 0.88, 0.87, and 0.84 for F4, respectively. SSI had a higher accuracy than ARFI for diagnoses of significant fibrosis (≥F2) (P = 0.004). Clinical factors related to obesity such as body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2) , waist circumference ≥102 cm or increased parietal wall thickness were associated with LSM failures when using SSI or FibroScan and with unreliable results when using ARFI. In univariate analysis, FibroScan values were slightly correlated with NAFLD activity score and steatosis (R = 0.28 and 0.22, respectively), whereas SSI and ARFI were not; however, these components of NAFLD did not affect LSM results in multivariate analysis. The cutoff values for SSI and FibroScan for staging fibrosis with a sensitivity ≥90% were very close: 6.3/6.2 kPa for ≥F2, 8.3/8.2 kPa for ≥F3, and 10.5/9.5 kPa for F4.",

Patients with CHB infection who underwent liver biopsy were consecutively included. After exclusions, 257 patients were analyzed. Two-dimensional SWE resulted in a significantly higher rate of reliable measurements (98.1%, 252/257) than TE (93.0%, 239/257) (p = 0.011). Liver stiffness measurements of the two examinations exhibited a strong correlation (r = 0.835, p < 0.001).

The purpose of this study was to perform an intra-individual comparison between 2-D shear wave elastography (2-D-SWE with a GE system) and Virtual Touch Tissue Quantification (VTTQ with a Siemens system) to assess whether these can be used interchangeably to grade fibrosis. Ninety-three patients (51 men, 42 women; mean age, 54 y) with liver disease of various etiologies (hepatitis B virus = 47, hepatitis C virus = 22; alcohol = 6, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis = 5, other = 13) were included. Using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values, liver fibrosis was classified into clinically non-significant (F0/F1) and significant (≥F2) fibrosis. Results indicated that intra-modality repeatability was excellent for both techniques (GE 2-D-SWE: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.89 [0.84-0.93]; VTTQ: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.90 [0.86-0.93]). Intra-modality classification agreement for fibrosis grading was good to excellent (GE 2-D-SWE: κ = 0.65, VTTQ: κ = 0.82). However, inter-modality agreement for fibrosis grading was only fair (κ = 0.31) using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values of fibrosis. In conclusion, although both GE 2-D-SWE and Siemens VTTQ exhibit good to excellent intra-modality repeatability, inter-modality agreement is only fair, suggesting that these should not be used interchangeably.",

      "# Title: Use of over-the-scope clips (OTSC) for hemostasis in gastrointestinal bleeding in patients under antithrombotic therapy.\n# Abstract: Background and study aims In patients taking different regimens of antithrombotic and/or anticoagulant therapy, endoscopic management of gastrointestinal bleeding represents a major challenge due to failing endogenous hemostasis. In this retrospective study we report on success rates with the over-the-scope clip (OTSC) system in upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding in this high-risk patient population. Patients and methods Between February 2011 and June 2014, 75 patients were treated with an OTSC for active gastrointestinal bleeding. Success rates with the first endoscopic therapy, rebleeding episodes, their management and the influence of antithrombotic or anticoagulant therapy were analyzed retrospectively. Results Application of the OTSC resulted in immediate hemostasis (primary success rate) in all 75 patients. However, in 34.7 % a rebleeding episode was noted that could be treated by further endoscopic interventions. Only 3 patients had to be sent to the operating room because of failure of endoscopic therapy. In the rebleeding group the use of antiplatelet therapies was higher (73.1 % vs. 48.9 %). Conclusions Application of the OTSC in GI bleeding results in a high rate of primary hemostasis. Rebleeding occurs in up to 35 % of patients receiving antithrombotic/anticoagulant therapy but can be managed successfully with further endoscopic treatments. Patients in the rebleeding group were more frequently treated with antiplatelet agents. Radiological or surgical therapy was reserved for a small subgroup not successfully managed by repeated endoscopic therapies. OTSC application is the treatment of choice in high-risk patients when conventional clips used as first-line treatment fail.",

The over-the-scope clip (OTSC) may overcome limitations of standard clips or thermocoagulation in high-risk bleeding lesions. We evaluate the main clinically relevant outcomes following endoscopic hemostasis with OTSC in high-risk lesions and/or patients. Patients and methods  This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected databases including all patients with UGIB and LGIB who underwent OTCS placement as first-line treatment in eleven tertiary endoscopic referral centers. Technical success, primary hemostasis, rebleeding, blood transfusion, hospital stay, and hemorrhage-related mortality rates were evaluated. Results  Data from 286 patients, with either UGIB (N = 214) or LGIB (N = 72) were available. Overall, 112 patients (39.2 %) were receiving antithrombotic therapy. Technical success and primary hemostasis rates were 97.9 % and 96.4 %, respectively. Early rebleeding occurred in 4.4 %, more frequently in those on antithrombotic therapy, and no late rebleeding was observed. Following a successful primary haemostasis, only 5.2 % patients needed blood transfusions, and the median hospital stay was 4 days (range: 3 - 11). Eighteen patients with either technical failure (N = 6) or rebleeding (N = 12) underwent radiological or surgical approaches. Overall, bleeding-related deaths occurred in 5 (1.7 %) patients, including 3 patients with technical procedural failure, and 2 in the rebleeding group.  Conclusions  Data from our large, multicenter study show that OTSC placement is an effective first-line treatment for hemostasis in high-risk patients and/or lesions both in upper and lower gastrointestinal tract.",

Patients and methods  Data on endoscopic treatment (first- vs. second-line) in PUB with OTSC and clinical data were analyzed. The primary outcome was the clinical success of hemostasis, defined as the absence of recurrent bleeding or further intervention. Secondary outcomes were factors associated with OTSC failure. Results  From April 2014 to March 2018, 100 patients (age 72 [20 - 98] y, female 36 %) with PUB in the stomach or the duodenum were treated endoscopically with the OTSC. The OTSC was used as a first-line procedure (primary-OTSC) in 66 pts. Successful hemostasis could be achieved in 90.9 %. After failure of an initial endoscopic treatment, 34 patients were treated with the OTSC (secondary-OTSC) and the treatment was successful in 94.1 %. Recurrent bleeding occurred in n = 10 for primary-OTSC (16.7 %) and in n = 7 pts in the secondary-OTSC (21.9 %) ( P  = 0.81). Clinical success in the primary-OTSC was 75.8 % and 73.5 % in the secondary-OTSC respectively. Conclusions  The OTSC has a high rate of initial bleeding control in first- and second line treatment of PUB. OTSC failure occurs more often in the duodenum than in the stomach and results in longer intensive care unit stay, higher amount of transfusions, and a higher reimbursement per case."

This single-center study was conducted to assess the accuracy of SWE in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), in comparison with transient elastography (TE), by using liver biopsy (LB) as the reference standard. Consecutive patients with CHC scheduled for LB by referring physicians were studied. One hundred and twenty-one patients met inclusion criteria. On the same day, real-time SWE using the ultrasound (US) system, Aixplorer (SuperSonic Imagine S.A., Aix-en-Provence, France), TE using FibroScan (Echosens, Paris, France), and US-assisted LB were consecutively performed. Fibrosis was staged according to the METAVIR scoring system. Analyses of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were performed to calculate optimal area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for F0-F1 versus F2-F4, F0- F2 versus F3-F4, and F0-F3 versus F4 for both real-time SWE and TE. Liver stiffness values increased in parallel with degree of liver fibrosis, both with SWE and TE.

The rate of reliable liver stiffness measurements was significantly higher with 2-D SWE than with TE: 99.2% versus 74.8%, p < 0.0001 (different reliability criteria used, according to current recommendations). In univariate analysis, liver stiffness measured with 2-D SWE correlated best with fibrosis stage estimated with TE (r = 0.699, p < 0.0001), followed by Forns score (r = 0.534, p < 0.0001) and King's score (r = 0.512, p < 0.0001). However, in multivariate analysis, only 2-D SWE-measured values remained correlated with fibrosis stage (p < 0.0001). The optimal 2-D SWE cutoff values for predicting significant fibrosis were 8.03 kPa for fibrosis stage ≥2 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.832) and 13.1 kPa for fibrosis stage 4 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.915), respectively.

It can evaluate larger regions of interest and, therefore, might be better at determining the overall fibrosis distribution. The aim of this prospective study was to compare 2-D SWE with the two best evaluated liver elastography methods, transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse (point SWE using acoustic radiation force impulse) imaging, in the same population group. The study included 132 patients with chronic hepatopathies, in which liver stiffness was evaluated using transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging and 2-D SWE. The reference methods were liver biopsy for the assessment of liver fibrosis (n = 101) and magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography for the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis (n = 31). No significant difference in diagnostic accuracy, assessed as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), was found between the three elastography methods (2-D SWE, transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging) for the diagnosis of significant and advanced fibrosis and liver cirrhosis in the \"per protocol\" (AUROCs for fibrosis stages ≥2: 0.90, 0.95 and 0.91; for fibrosis stage [F] ≥3: 0.93, 0.95 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.92, 0.96 and 0.92) and \"intention to diagnose\" cohort (AUROCs for F ≥2: 0.87, 0.92 and 0.91; for F ≥3: 0.91, 0.93 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.88, 0.90 and 0.89).

The goal of this study was to assess the clinical use of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) evaluated by supersonic shear imaging (SSI), FibroScan, and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) in a cohort of NAFLD patients who underwent liver biopsy. A total of 291 NAFLD patients were prospectively enrolled from November 2011 to February 2015 at 2 French university hospitals. LSM was assessed by SSI, FibroScan (M probe), and ARFI within two weeks prior to liver biopsy. Calculations of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) were performed and compared for the staging of liver fibrosis. AUROC for SSI, FibroScan, and ARFI were 0.86, 0.82, and 0.77 for diagnoses of ≥F2; 0.89, 0.86, and 0.84 for ≥F3; and 0.88, 0.87, and 0.84 for F4, respectively. SSI had a higher accuracy than ARFI for diagnoses of significant fibrosis (≥F2) (P = 0.004). Clinical factors related to obesity such as body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2) , waist circumference ≥102 cm or increased parietal wall thickness were associated with LSM failures when using SSI or FibroScan and with unreliable results when using ARFI. In univariate analysis, FibroScan values were slightly correlated with NAFLD activity score and steatosis (R = 0.28 and 0.22, respectively), whereas SSI and ARFI were not; however, these components of NAFLD did not affect LSM results in multivariate analysis. The cutoff values for SSI and FibroScan for staging fibrosis with a sensitivity ≥90% were very close: 6.3/6.2 kPa for ≥F2, 8.3/8.2 kPa for ≥F3, and 10.5/9.5 kPa for F4.",

Patients with CHB infection who underwent liver biopsy were consecutively included. After exclusions, 257 patients were analyzed. Two-dimensional SWE resulted in a significantly higher rate of reliable measurements (98.1%, 252/257) than TE (93.0%, 239/257) (p = 0.011). Liver stiffness measurements of the two examinations exhibited a strong correlation (r = 0.835, p < 0.001).

The purpose of this study was to perform an intra-individual comparison between 2-D shear wave elastography (2-D-SWE with a GE system) and Virtual Touch Tissue Quantification (VTTQ with a Siemens system) to assess whether these can be used interchangeably to grade fibrosis. Ninety-three patients (51 men, 42 women; mean age, 54 y) with liver disease of various etiologies (hepatitis B virus = 47, hepatitis C virus = 22; alcohol = 6, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis = 5, other = 13) were included. Using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values, liver fibrosis was classified into clinically non-significant (F0/F1) and significant (≥F2) fibrosis. Results indicated that intra-modality repeatability was excellent for both techniques (GE 2-D-SWE: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.89 [0.84-0.93]; VTTQ: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.90 [0.86-0.93]). Intra-modality classification agreement for fibrosis grading was good to excellent (GE 2-D-SWE: κ = 0.65, VTTQ: κ = 0.82). However, inter-modality agreement for fibrosis grading was only fair (κ = 0.31) using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values of fibrosis. In conclusion, although both GE 2-D-SWE and Siemens VTTQ exhibit good to excellent intra-modality repeatability, inter-modality agreement is only fair, suggesting that these should not be used interchangeably.",

A total of 80 patients with acute cerebral infarction who were treated at our hospital were randomly selected. They were divided into groups A and B. The two groups were treated with intravenous thrombolysis, while group B received sub-hypothermia treatment. Prior to treatment and at 7 days after treatment, 5 ml of venous blood was collected and stored in a freezer at -80˚C. IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 levels were detected by ELISA and compared between the groups and time-points. The results were as follows: i) At 7 days after treatment, the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in group B were significantly decreased compared with those in group A (P<0.05), while there was no significant difference of these levels between group A and B before treatment (P>0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions in group A and group B was 35 and 20% respectively, and the mortality rate was 10 and 5%, respectively. There were no significant differences in adverse events and mortality between the two groups (P>0.05). In addition, a positive correlation of the level of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was determined in the patients prior to treatment. In conclusion, mild hypothermia treatment in addition to intravenous thrombolysis significantly reduced the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in patients with acute cerebral infarction and reduced inflammation, and should therefore be incorporated in clinical practice.",

In this retrospective study we report on success rates with the over-the-scope clip (OTSC) system in upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding in this high-risk patient population. Patients and methods Between February 2011 and June 2014, 75 patients were treated with an OTSC for active gastrointestinal bleeding. Success rates with the first endoscopic therapy, rebleeding episodes, their management and the influence of antithrombotic or anticoagulant therapy were analyzed retrospectively. Results Application of the OTSC resulted in immediate hemostasis (primary success rate) in all 75 patients. However, in 34.7 % a rebleeding episode was noted that could be treated by further endoscopic interventions. Only 3 patients had to be sent to the operating room because of failure of endoscopic therapy. In the rebleeding group the use of antiplatelet therapies was higher (73.1 % vs. 48.9 %). Conclusions Application of the OTSC in GI bleeding results in a high rate of primary hemostasis. Rebleeding occurs in up to 35 % of patients receiving antithrombotic/anticoagulant therapy but can be managed successfully with further endoscopic treatments. Patients in the rebleeding group were more frequently treated with antiplatelet agents.

Technical success, primary hemostasis, rebleeding, blood transfusion, hospital stay, and hemorrhage-related mortality rates were evaluated. Results  Data from 286 patients, with either UGIB (N = 214) or LGIB (N = 72) were available. Overall, 112 patients (39.2 %) were receiving antithrombotic therapy. Technical success and primary hemostasis rates were 97.9 % and 96.4 %, respectively.

Patients and methods  Data on endoscopic treatment (first- vs. second-line) in PUB with OTSC and clinical data were analyzed. The primary outcome was the clinical success of hemostasis, defined as the absence of recurrent bleeding or further intervention. Secondary outcomes were factors associated with OTSC failure. Results  From April 2014 to March 2018, 100 patients (age 72 [20 - 98] y, female 36 %) with PUB in the stomach or the duodenum were treated endoscopically with the OTSC. The OTSC was used as a first-line procedure (primary-OTSC) in 66 pts. Successful hemostasis could be achieved in 90.9 %. After failure of an initial endoscopic treatment, 34 patients were treated with the OTSC (secondary-OTSC) and the treatment was successful in 94.1 %. Recurrent bleeding occurred in n = 10 for primary-OTSC (16.7 %) and in n = 7 pts in the secondary-OTSC (21.9 %) ( P  = 0.81). Clinical success in the primary-OTSC was 75.8 % and 73.5 % in the secondary-OTSC respectively. Conclusions  The OTSC has a high rate of initial bleeding control in first- and second line treatment of PUB. OTSC failure occurs more often in the duodenum than in the stomach and results in longer intensive care unit stay, higher amount of transfusions, and a higher reimbursement per case."

The pathophysiology of PM 2.5 pollution may be from increased inflammatory responses affecting each hematological component. For the public, avoidance of exposure and reduction in PM 2.5 pollution should be encouraged. Interventions should be focused on the high-risk groups including the elderly with cardiovascular diseases, young children, and pregnant women. Personal facemasks can minimize inhaled small particles and reduce pollution exposure time. Air purifiers also lessen indoor pollution concentrations. Improving air quality has to be addressed for the general population. Decreasing PM 2.5 pollution is essential to prevent hematological adverse events. Further studies are needed to determine whether reducing PM 2.5 exposure can decrease these disorders. Pathophysiology of PM 2.5 effects on individual hematologic parameters and the high-risk groups. High PM 2.5 : A 24-h mean level between 25 and 50 μg/m 3 or annual mean over 10 μg/m 3 . Very high PM 2.5 : A 24-h mean level over 50 μg/m 3 .",

      "# Title: Particulate matter air pollution and cardiovascular disease: An update to the scientific statement from the American Heart Association.\n# Abstract: In 2004, the first American Heart Association scientific statement on \"Air Pollution and Cardiovascular Disease\" concluded that exposure to particulate matter (PM) air pollution contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In the interim, numerous studies have expanded our understanding of this association and further elucidated the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved. The main objective of this updated American Heart Association scientific statement is to provide a comprehensive review of the new evidence linking PM exposure with cardiovascular disease, with a specific focus on highlighting the clinical implications for researchers and healthcare providers. The writing group also sought to provide expert consensus opinions on many aspects of the current state of science and updated suggestions for areas of future research. On the basis of the findings of this review, several new conclusions were reached, including the following: Exposure to PM <2.5 microm in diameter (PM(2.5)) over a few hours to weeks can trigger cardiovascular disease-related mortality and nonfatal events; longer-term exposure (eg, a few years) increases the risk for cardiovascular mortality to an even greater extent than exposures over a few days and reduces life expectancy within more highly exposed segments of the population by several months to a few years; reductions in PM levels are associated with decreases in cardiovascular mortality within a time frame as short as a few years; and many credible pathological mechanisms have been elucidated that lend biological plausibility to these findings. It is the opinion of the writing group that the overall evidence is consistent with a causal relationship between PM(2.5) exposure and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This body of evidence has grown and been strengthened substantially since the first American Heart Association scientific statement was published. Finally, PM(2.5) exposure is deemed a modifiable factor that contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.",

No comprehensive study examining associations between both short- and long-term exposure to particulate matter (PM)2.5 and DVT or PE has been published. Using a novel PM2.5 prediction model, we study whether long- and short-term PM2.5 exposure is associated with DVT and PE admissions among elderly across the northeastern United States.",
      "# Title: Effects of particulate matter exposure on blood 5-hydroxymethylation: results from the Beijing truck driver air pollution study.\n# Abstract: Previous studies have reported epigenetic changes induced by environmental exposures. However, previous investigations did not distinguish 5-methylcytosine (5mC) from a similar oxidative form with opposite functions, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Here, we measured blood DNA global 5mC and 5hmC by ELISA and used adjusted mixed-effects regression models to evaluate the effects of ambient PM10 and personal PM2.5 and its elemental components-black carbon (BC), aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), iron (Fe), sulfur (S), silicon (Si), titanium (Ti), and zinc (Zn)-on blood global 5mC and 5hmC levels. The study was conducted in 60 truck drivers and 60 office workers in Beijing, China from The Beijing Truck Driver Air Pollution Study at 2 exams separated by one to 2 weeks. Blood 5hmC level (0.08%) was ∼83-fold lower than 5mC (6.61%). An inter-quartile range (IQR) increase in same-day PM10 was associated with increases in 5hmC of 26.1% in office workers (P = 0.004), 20.2% in truck drivers (P = 0.014), and 21.9% in all participants combined (P < 0.001). PM10 effects on 5hmC were increasingly stronger when averaged over 4, 7, and 14 d preceding assessment (up to 132.6% for the 14-d average in all participants, P < 0.001). PM10 effects were also significant after controlling for multiple testing (family-wise error rate; FWER < 0.05). 5hmC was not correlated with personal measures of PM2.5 and elemental components (FWER > 0.05). 5mC showed no correlations with PM10, PM2.5, and elemental components measures (FWER > 0.05). Our study suggests that exposure to ambient PM10 affects 5hmC over time, but not 5mC. This finding demonstrates the need to differentiate 5hmC and 5mC in environmental studies of DNA methylation.",
      "# Title: Environmental nanoparticles are significantly over-expressed in acute myeloid leukemia.\n# Abstract: The increase in the incidence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) may suggest a possible environmental etiology. PM2.5 was declared by IARC a Class I carcinogen. No report has focused on particulate environmental pollution together with AML. The study investigated the presence and composition of particulate matter in blood with a Scanning Electron Microscope coupled with an Energy Dispersive Spectroscope, a sensor capable of identifying the composition of foreign bodies. 38 peripheral blood samples, 19 AML cases and 19 healthy controls, were analyzed. A significant overload of particulate matter-derived nanoparticles linked or aggregated to blood components was found in AML patients, while almost absent in matched healthy controls. Two-tailed Student's t-test, MANOVA and Principal Component Analysis indicated that the total numbers of aggregates and particles were statistically different between cases and controls (MANOVA, P<0.001 and P=0.009 respectively). The particles detected showed to contain highly-reactive, non-biocompatible and non-biodegradable metals; in particular, micro- and nano-sized particles grouped in organic/inorganic clusters, with statistically higher frequency of a subgroup of elements in AML samples. The demonstration, for the first time, of an overload of nanoparticles linked to blood components in AML patients could be the basis for a possible, novel pathogenetic mechanism for AML development.",

      "# Title: Increased Outdoor PM2.5 Concentration Is Associated with Moderate/Severe Anemia in Children Aged 6-59 Months in Lima, Peru.\n# Abstract: Anemia affects 1.62 billion people worldwide. Although iron deficiency is the main cause of anemia, several other factors may explain its high prevalence. In this study, we sought to analyze the association between outdoor particulate matter PM2.5 levels with anemia prevalence in children aged 6-59 months residing in Lima, Peru (n = 139,368), one of the cities with the worst air pollution in Latin America. The study period was from 2012 to 2016. Anemia was defined according to the World Health Organization (Hb < 11 g/dL). PM2.5 values were estimated by a mathematical model that combined data observed from monitors, with satellite and meteorological data. PM2.5 was analyzed by quintiles. Multiple linear and logistic regressions were used to estimate the associations between hemoglobin concentration (beta) and anemia (odds ratio) with PM2.5, after adjusting by covariates. Prevalence of anemia was 39.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 39.3-39.9). Mild anemia was observed in 30.8% of children and moderate/severe in 8.84% of children. Anemic children compared with nonanemic children are mainly males, have low body weight, higher rate of stunting, and live in an environment with high PM2.5 concentration. A slight decrease in hemoglobin (4Q B: -0.03, 95% CI: -0.05 to -0.02; 5Q B: -0.04, 95% CI: -0.06 to -0.01) and an increase in the probability of moderate/severe anemia (4Q OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.10-1.27; 5Q OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.08-1.29) were observed with increased exposure to PM2.5. We conclude that outdoor PM2.5 levels were significantly associated with decreased hemoglobin values and an increase in prevalence of moderate/severe anemia in children under 5 years old.",

      "# Title: Residential Exposure to PM2.5 Components and Risk of Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in Denmark: A Nationwide Register-Based Case-Control Study.\n# Abstract: In a recent study, we observed an increased risk of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) associated with exposure to fine atmospheric particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon (BC). In this nationwide register-based case-control study, we focus on specific components of PM2.5 in relation to childhood NHL in Denmark (1981-2013) by identifying all incidents of childhood NHL cases in the Danish Cancer Registry (n = 170) and four (cancer-free) randomly selected controls matched by date of birth and sex. We applied PM2.5 concentrations and the following sub-components: secondary organic aerosols (SOA), secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA; i.e., NO3-, NH4+ and SO42-), BC, organic carbon (OC) and sea salt. We calculated a time-weighted exposure average from birth to index-date at all addresses. Odds ratios (ORs) were adjusted for register-based socio-demographic variables. We observed adjusted ORs and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of 2.05 (1.10, 3.83) per interquartile range (IQR, 4.83 µg/m3) PM2.5 and 1.73 (0.68, 4.41) per IQR (3.71 µg/m3) SIA, 0.95 (0.71, 1.29) per IQR (0.05 µg/m3) SOA, 1.22 (1.02, 1.46) per IQR (0.39 µg/m3) BC, 1.02 (0.83, 1.26) per IQR (0.56 µg/m3) OC and 1.01 (0.79, 1.30) per IQR (0.87 µg/m3) sea salt, respectively. The estimates were attenuated after adjustment for PM2.5, whereas the OR for PM2.5 remained increased regardless of adjustment for specific components. The findings indicate that the previously observed relation between PM2.5 and childhood NHL may be related to BC (as reported in our previous study) but also partly to SIA, but the role of specific chemical components of PM2.5 remains ambiguous."

      "# Title: Risk assessment of hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma development using liver stiffness measurement (FibroScan).\n# Abstract: Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using FibroScan accurately assesses the degree of liver fibrosis and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in patients with chronic hepatitis C. This study investigated the usefulness of LSM as a predictor of HCC development in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). A total of 1,130 patients with non-biopsy-proven CHB who underwent LSM between May 2005 and December 2007 were enrolled in this prospective study. After LSM was performed, patients attended regular follow-up as part of a surveillance program for the detection of HCC. The mean age of the patients (767 men, 363 women) was 50.2 years, and the median LSM was 7.7 kPa. Six hundred seventy-two (59.5%) patients received antiviral treatment before or after enrollment. During the follow-up period (median, 30.7 months; range, 24.0-50.9 months), HCC developed in 57 patients (2.0% per 1 person-year). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year cumulative incidence rates of HCC were 0.80%, 3.26%, and 5.98%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, together with old age, male sex, heavy alcohol consumption (>80 g/day), serum albumin, and hepatitis B e antigen positivity, patients with a higher LSM (>8 kPa) were at a significantly greater risk of HCC development, with the following hazard ratios: 3.07 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-9.31; P = 0.047) for LSM 8.1-13 kPa; 4.68 (95% CI, 1.40-15.64; P = 0.012) for LSM 13.1-18 kPa; 5.55 (95% CI, 1.53-20.04; P = 0.009) for LSM 18.1-23 kPa; and 6.60 (95% CI, 1.83-23.84; P = 0.004) for LSM >23 kPa.",

      "# Title: Risk assessment of clinical outcomes in Asian patients with chronic hepatitis B using enhanced liver fibrosis test.\n# Abstract: Serum fibrosis markers, such as the enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) test, have been suggested as alternatives for liver biopsy (LB) in assessing liver fibrosis. We investigated the efficacy of the ELF test in predicting development of liver-related events (LREs) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). A total of 170 patients (103 men; 60.6%) with CHB who underwent LB and serological tests for determining ELFs were enrolled. All patients were followed up to monitor LRE development, defined as hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and/or liver-related death. The mean age was 45.3 years. During the follow-up period (median, 41 months), 39 (22.9%) patients experienced LREs. In patients with LREs, age, proportion of male gender, ELF test results, age-spleen-platelet ratio (ASPRI), liver stiffness (LS) value, and proportion of histological cirrhosis were significantly higher than those in patients without LREs (all P < 0.05). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves to predict LRE development were 0.808 for the ELF test, 0.732 for LS value, 0.713 for histological fibrosis stages using Batts and Ludwig's scoring system, and 0.687 for ASPRI. On multivariate analysis, along with age, the ELF test was an independent predictor of LRE development (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.438; P < 0.001). When we applied a three-tier stratification of our study population using cut-off ELF values of 8.10 and 10.40, patients with low (P = 0.002; adjusted HR: 0.045; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.006-0.330) and intermediate (P < 0.001; adjusted HR: 0.239; 95% CI: 0.122-0.469) ELF range were found less likely to develop LREs, compared to those with high ELF range.",
      "# Title: Increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic hepatitis B patients with transient elastography-defined subclinical cirrhosis.\n# Abstract: Early detection of liver cirrhosis in its subclinical stage is of paramount importance to identify high-risk individuals for developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study investigated whether transient elastography (TE) can identify patients with subclinical cirrhosis (SCC) who are at increased risk of developing HCC among chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients without clinical evidence of cirrhosis. A total of 2,876 CHB patients without clinical cirrhosis who received TE examinations between April 2006 and December 2012 were enrolled in this prospective study. SCC was defined as a nonclinical cirrhosis, but with a liver stiffness (LS) value ≥13 kilopascals (kPa). Mean age of the study population was 46.1 years, and male gender was predominant (n = 1,775; 61.7%). Mean LS value was 7.9 kPa, and SCC was identified in 285 (9.9%) patients. During the median follow-up period of 48.9 months (range, 6.6-96.2), HCC developed in 16 patients (13.3 per 1,000 person-years) in the SCC group and 36 (3.4 per 1,000 person-years) in the non-SCC group. Cumulative incidence rate of HCC in the SCC group was significantly higher than that in the non-SCC group (P < 0.001, log-rank test). On multivariate analysis, SCC was independently associated with a risk of developing HCC, regardless of antiviral therapy (without antiviral therapy: hazard ratio [HR]: 4.680; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.187-18.441; P = 0.027; with antiviral therapy: HR, 3.344; 95% CI: 1.526-7.328; P = 0.003).",

We investigated whether the combined use of ultrasonography (US) and transient elastography (TE) to diagnose cirrhosis is beneficial for the risk assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver-related events in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). A total of 9300 patients with CHB who underwent US and TE in two institutions between 2006 and 2018 were enrolled. TE value ≥13 kPa was set to indicate cirrhosis. Patients were divided into four groups: US(+)TE(+) (cirrhosis by US and TE), US(+)TE(-) (cirrhosis by US, but not by TE), US(-)TE(+) (cirrhosis by TE, but not by US) and US(-)TE(-) (non-cirrhosis by US and TE).The patients were predominantly male (n = 5474, 58.9%) with a mean age of 47.5 years. The proportions of patients with cirrhosis diagnosed by US and TE were 17.2% (n = 1595) and 13.2% (n = 1225), respectively. The proportion of patients with discordant results in diagnosing cirrhosis by US and TE was 18.7% (n = 1740). During follow-up (median: 60.0 months), HCC and liver-related events developed in 481 (5.2%) and 759 (8.2%) patients, respectively. The cumulative incidence rates of HCC and liver-related events were highest in the US(+)TE(+) group, intermediate-high in the US(-)TE(+) group, intermediate-low in the US(+)TE(-) group and lowest in the US(-)TE(-) group (overall p < .001).

Data on outcomes in patients with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for CTO, however, are scarce. A total of 2,002 consecutive patients undergoing PCI for CTO from January 2005 to December 2013 were divided into patients with and without previous CABG, and outcomes were retrospectively assessed. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality. Median follow-up was 2.6 years (interquartile range 1.1 to 3.1). A total of 292 patients (15%) had previous CABG; they were older and had a greater prevalence of comorbidities. Procedural success was achieved in 75% and 84% of patients in the previous CABG and the non-CABG groups (p <0.001), respectively. All-cause mortality was 16% and 11% in the previous CABG and the non-CABG groups (p = 0.002), and differences were mitigated after adjustment for baseline characteristics (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86 to 1.74, p = 0.27). All-cause death was significantly reduced in patients with procedural success, both in the previous CABG (11% vs 32%, adjusted HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.77, p = 0.005) and the non-CABG groups (10% vs 20%, adjusted HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.86, p = 0.004), with similar mortality benefits associated with successful revascularization in both groups (interaction p = 0.24). In conclusion, the relative survival benefit of successful recanalization of CTO is independent of previous CABG. However, owing to a greater baseline risk, the absolute survival benefit of successful CTO procedures is more pronounced in patients with previous CABG than in non-CABG patients.",

      "conclusionB": "Based on the provided context, the primary concluding statement is:\n\n**Successful CTO PCI in patients with prior CABG improves angina symptoms and reduces the risk of myocardial infarction compared to medical management alone, although these patients remain at a substantial long-term risk for repeat revascularization and mortality due to the complexity of their underlying coronary disease.**"

    "referenceConclusion": "Pre-conditioning significantly reduced the severity of creatine kinase release, delayed-onset muscle soreness, loss of maximal voluntary contraction force and the range of motion decrease. Pre-conditioning may prevent severe EIMD and accelerate recovery of muscle force generation capacity. The current systematic review identified that pre-conditioning activities are effective in attenuating EIMD measures, CK, muscle soreness, ROM and maximal voluntary force production. These findings suggest the use of pre-conditioning activities prior to a strenuous bout of exercise does provide a significant protective effect when performed a minimum of 24 h prior to the damaging stimulus. Furthermore, the greater improvement in MVC suggests that the pre-conditioning activities may accelerate the recovery of muscle contractile properties following strenuous exercises. However, it is unclear if pre-conditioning would prevent EIMD from more complex exercises or to what extent EIMD prevention carries over into other modes of exercise.",

      "# Title: Muscle tenderness and peak torque changes after downhill running following a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: Unaccustomed exercise (usually of an eccentric nature) is often followed by delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Previous studies have found that prior eccentric activity produces a training effect which reduces DOMS and morphological changes. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a prior bout of maximal isokinetic eccentric exercise on DOMS, strength loss and plasma creatine kinase (CK) changes following a downhill run. Ten male subjects with a mean (+/- S.D.) age of 22.5 +/- 2.8 years, body mass of 62.67 +/- 0.05 kg and height of 176 +/- 3 cm were allocated to either a treatment group or a control group. The treatment group performed 100 maximal eccentric activations of the knee extensors in the dominant leg at 0.52 rad s-1. Two weeks later, the downhill run was performed on a motor-driven treadmill. This consisted of five bouts of 8 min at a gradient of -10% at a speed corresponding to 80% of the predicted maximal heart rate. The untrained group performed the downhill run as above but without the prior isokinetic session. Tenderness measurements, plasma CK activity and concentric and eccentric isokinetic peak torque measurements of the knee extensors at 0.52 and 2.83 rad s-1 were recorded prior to, immediately following and 2, 4 and 7 days after each protocol. The isokinetic protocol caused an increase (P < 0.01) in CK and tenderness and a decrease (P < 0.05) in concentric and eccentric torque at both speeds in the treatment group. Following the downhill run, a reduction in peak torque (P < 0.01) was observed in the eccentric and concentric modes at both isokinetic speeds in the control group. For the treatment group, the decrease in peak torque occurred only at the faster eccentric speed. With the exception of the faster eccentric speed, the decrement in peak torque was greater in the control group in all post-exercise isokinetic strength tests. There was less tenderness (P < 0.01) in the trained knee extensor muscle group. Peak torque also returned to pre-downhill values earlier for the trained group. Although plasma CK activity increased in both groups after downhill running, it was much lower (P < 0.01) in the trained group. The results suggest that a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric training reduces muscle damage, reduces the amount of strength loss and decreases the sensation of DOMS after downhill running.",
      "# Title: Exercise-induced skeletal muscle damage and adaptation following repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions.\n# Abstract: Repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions were used to examine indirect indices of exercise-induced muscle damage and adaptation in human skeletal muscle. Twenty-four subjects (18 females, 6 males) aged 20.0 +/- 1.4 years (mean +/- S.D.) performed an initial bout of either 10 (n = 7), 30 (n = 9) or 50 (n = 8) maximum voluntary eccentric contractions of the knee extensors, followed by a second bout of 50 contractions 3 weeks later using the same leg. Muscle soreness was elevated after all bouts (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon test), although the initial bout reduced the soreness associated with the second bout. Force loss and a decline in the 20:100 Hz percutaneous electrical myostimulation force ratio were observed after all exercise bouts (P < 0.01). Serum creatine kinase activity was elevated following the initial bouts of 30 and 50 repetitions (P < 0.01), but there was no increase following 10 repetitions. No increase in serum creatine kinase activity was observed in any group following the second bout of contractions (P > 0.05). We conclude that skeletal muscle adaptation can be brought about by a single bout of relatively few eccentric muscle contractions. Increasing the number of eccentric muscle repetitions did not result in an increased prophylactic effect on skeletal muscle.",
      "# Title: Influence of previous concentric exercise on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether a fatiguing concentric exercise performed immediately before eccentric exercise would exacerbate eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. One arm of nine female subjects (mean +/- s: 23.3 +/- 6.7 years) performed 12 maximal eccentric actions of the elbow flexors (ECC), and the other arm performed 100 repetitions of isokinetic concentric actions of the elbow flexors followed by the same eccentric exercise (CON-ECC). The two exercise regimens (ECC and CON-ECC) were separated by 2 weeks and presented in a counterbalanced order. Changes in muscle soreness level, maximal isometric force generation, relaxed and flexed elbow joint angle, upper arm circumference and plasma creatine kinase activity were compared between the ECC and CON-ECC conditions. All measures changed significantly after both ECC and CON-ECC; however, there were significant differences in the changes between the conditions. A lower level of soreness, a faster recovery of maximal isometric force generation, a smaller decrease in relaxed elbow joint angle and a smaller increase in upper arm circumference and creatine kinase activity were evident after the CON-ECC condition compared to the ECC condition. Thus, it would seem that muscle damage was attenuated by performance of previous concentric exercise. An additional experiment using a different group of subjects (n = 5) showed that warm-up exercise before the eccentric exercise also attenuated eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Acute adaptation to low volume eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: Many symptoms of eccentric muscle damage can be substantially reduced if a similar eccentric bout is repeated within several weeks of the initial bout. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a nondamaging, low repetition, low volume eccentric exercise bout could also provide a protective/adaptive effect.",
      "# Title: The repeated bout effect of reduced-load eccentric exercise on elbow flexor muscle damage.\n# Abstract: In this study we investigated the extent to which an initial eccentric exercise consisting of two (2ECC) or six maximal eccentric actions (6ECC) of the elbow flexors would produce a similar effect to 24 maximal eccentric actions (24ECC), on a second bout of 24ECC performed 2 weeks later. Male students (n = 34) were assigned to one of three groups, and with their non-dominant arm performed either 2ECC (n = 12), 6ECC (n = 10), or 24ECC (n = 12) as a first bout of exercise. Two weeks later all groups performed 24ECC. Maximal isometric strength, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration were assessed before, immediately after, and for 4 days after exercise. Changes in all variables were compared between the bouts and groups by a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance. All variables changed significantly (P< 0.05) after 2ECC, 6ECC, and 24ECC, but the amount of change after 2ECC and 6ECC was significantly smaller (P<0.05) than both 6ECC and 24ECC, and 24ECC, respectively. After the second bout, the 6ECC and 24ECC groups showed a profound repeated bout effect, and no significant differences were found between the groups. All variables except muscle soreness were significantly (P< 0.05) larger after the second bout for the 2ECC group, however the changes observed after 24ECC were significantly smaller (P < 0.01) than those observed after the first 24ECC of the 24ECC group. These results suggest that it is not necessary to conduct a high number of eccentric actions in the first bout to elicit a repeated bout effect in a subsequent bout performed some time later.",
      "# Title: Partial protection against muscle damage by eccentric actions at short muscle lengths.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that maximal eccentric actions at a short muscle length would fail to confer a protective effect against muscle damage induced by maximal eccentric exercise at a long muscle length.",
      "# Title: Intensity of eccentric exercise, shift of optimum angle, and the magnitude of repeated-bout effect.\n# Abstract: This study compared the effect of four different intensities of initial eccentric exercise (ECC1) on optimum angle shift and extent of muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise. Fifty-two male students were placed into 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% groups (n = 13 per group), performing 30 eccentric actions of the elbow flexors of 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% of maximal isometric strength [maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)] for ECC1, followed 2-3 wk later by a similar exercise (ECC2) that used 100% MVC load. MVC at six elbow joint angles, range of motion, upper arm circumference, serum creatine kinase activity, myoglobin concentration, and muscle soreness were measured before and for 5 days following ECC1 and ECC2. A rightward shift of optimum angle following ECC1 was significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 100% and 80% than for the 60% and 40% groups, and it decreased significantly (P < 0.05) from immediately to 5 days postexercise. By the time ECC2 was performed, only the 100% group kept a significant shift (4 degrees). Changes in most of the criterion measures following ECC1 were significantly greater for the 100% and 80% groups compared with the 60% and 40% groups. Changes in the criterion measures following ECC2 were significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 40% group compared with other groups. Although the magnitude of repeated bout effect following ECC2 was significantly (P < 0.05) smaller for the 40% and 60% groups, all groups showed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced changes in criterion measures following ECC2 compared with the ECC1 100% bout. We conclude that the repeated-bout effect was not dependent on the shift of optimum angle.",
      "# Title: Repeated bout effect after maximal eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: We hypothesized that a bout of high or low volume eccentric exercise would protect against muscle damage following a subsequent high volume bout and that adaptation would be attributable to neural changes, independent of the initial exercise volume. Sixteen males performed either 45 (ECC45) or 10 (ECC10) maximal eccentric contractions using the elbow flexors, followed by an ECC45 bout 2 weeks later. Damage markers were measured for the following 96 h; EMG and work done during the first 10 eccentric contractions were also recorded. CK, soreness, and decrements in MVC and range of motion (ROM) were greater in bout 1 than bout 2 (p < 0.01). Soreness, MVC and ROM were greater after the initial ECC45 bout compared to the initial ECC10 bout and the repeated bouts of ECC45 exercise in both groups (p < 0.01). Median frequency decreased from bout 1 to bout 2 (p < 0.001), no differences between groups were observed. An ECC45 bout of maximal eccentric exercise causes more initial damage than an ECC10 bout of maximal eccentric exercise, although both confer protection from subsequent ECC45 bouts of maximal eccentric contractions, which are attributable, at least in part, to a shift in the frequency content of EMG.",
      "# Title: A light load eccentric exercise confers protection against a subsequent bout of more demanding eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that a light eccentric exercise (ECC) that does not induce a loss of muscle function and delayed onset muscle soreness would confer a protective effect against a more strenuous ECC. Eighteen young men were randomly placed into two groups: 10-40% (n=9) and 40% (n=9). Subjects in the 10-40% group performed ECC of the elbow flexors (six sets of five reps) using a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (MVC) at an elbow joint angle of 90 degrees , followed 2 days later by ECC using a dumbbell weight of 40% MVC. Subjects in the 40% group performed the 40% ECC only. Changes in MVC, range of motion (ROM), upper arm circumference (CIR), plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and muscle soreness before, immediately after, 1-5 and 7 days following the 40% ECC were compared between groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any of the criterion measures were found immediately and 1-2 days after the 10% ECC. Following the 40% ECC, the 10-40% group showed significantly (P<0.05) smaller decreases in MVC and ROM, and smaller increases in muscle soreness compared with the 40% group, but no significant differences between groups were evident for CIR and plasma CK activity. These results suggest that the 10% ECC induced some protection against a subsequent bout of 40% ECC performed 2 days later. It appears that the light eccentric exercise preconditioned the muscles for exposure to the subsequent damaging eccentric exercise bout.",
      "# Title: Protection against muscle damage following fifty drop jumps conferred by ten drop jumps.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether 10 drop jumps (DJs) would confer protective effect against muscle damage and soreness in a subsequent bout of 50 DJs. Sixteen men were randomly placed into either a group performing 1 set of 10 DJs followed by 5 sets of 10 DJs (10-50, n = 8) or another group performing 2 bouts of 5 sets of 10 DJs (50-50, n = 8) separated by 2 weeks. The DJs were performed from a box height of 0.6 m, with a 10-second interval between jumps and a 1-minute rest between sets. Jump height, peak vertical ground reaction force, ground contact time, and heart rate during DJs were measured, and blood lactate concentration was assessed before and immediately after DJs. Changes in maximal isometric (ISO) and isokinetic concentric torque (CON), vertical jump, muscle soreness, and plasma creatine kinase activity before, immediately after, and at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours following exercise were compared between groups for the first and second bouts and between the bouts by a 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance. Changes in ISO, CON, vertical jump, and muscle soreness were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller for 10 DJs compared with 50 DJs; however, no significant differences in the measures between groups were evident following the second bout. The changes in the measures following 50 DJs in the 10-50 group were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller than those following the first bout of the 50-50 group. These results suggest that 10 DJs and 50 DJs conferred the same magnitude of protective effect against muscle damage by 50 DJs.",
      "# Title: Muscle damage protection by low-intensity eccentric contractions remains for 2 weeks but not 3 weeks.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that the protective effect conferred by a low-intensity eccentric exercise against maximal eccentric exercise would not last more than a week. Untrained men (21.3 ± 1.6 years) were allocated into either a control or one of four repeated bout groups (n = 13 per group). The repeated bout groups performed 30 low-intensity eccentric contractions (ECC) of the elbow flexors with a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (10%-ECC) either 2 days, 7 days (1 week), 14 days (2 weeks) or 21 days (3 weeks) before 30 maximal eccentric contractions (Max-ECC). The control group performed Max-ECC only. Changes in maximal voluntary contraction strength, optimum angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following 10%-ECC were analysed by a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Changes in the variables following Max-ECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. The 10%-ECC did not change any variables, showing no indication of muscle damage. The changes in all variables following Max-ECC were smaller (P < 0.05) for 2-day, 1- and 2-week groups than control group, without significant differences between 2-day and 1-week groups. The 2-week group showed greater (P < 0.05) changes in all variables compared with 2-day and 1-week groups. Changes in the variables were similar between 3-week and control groups, except for muscle soreness showing smaller (P < 0.05) changes for 3-week group. These results suggest that non-damaging eccentric exercise confers a protective effect against Max-Ecc, but the effect is attenuated between 1 and 2 weeks.",
      "# Title: Two maximal isometric contractions attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVC-ISO) would attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. Young untrained men were placed into one of the two experimental groups or one control group (n = 13 per group). Subjects in the experimental groups performed either two or 10 MVC-ISO of the elbow flexors at a long muscle length (20° flexion) 2 days prior to 30 maximal isokinetic eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors. Subjects in the control group performed the eccentric contractions without MVC-ISO. No significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction peak torque, peak torque angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and myoglobin concentration, muscle soreness, and ultrasound echo intensity were evident after MVC-ISO. Changes in the variables following eccentric contractions were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2 MVC-ISO group (e.g., peak torque loss at 5 days after exercise, 23% ± 3%; peak CK activity, 1964 ± 452 IU·L(-1); peak muscle soreness, 46 ± 4 mm) or the 10 MVC-ISO group (13% ± 3%, 877 ± 198 IU·L(-1), 30 ± 4 mm) compared with the control (34% ± 4%, 6192 ± 1747 IU·L(-1), 66 ± 5 mm). The 10 MVC-ISO group showed smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following eccentric contractions compared with the 2 MVC-ISO group. Therefore, two MVC-ISO conferred potent protective effects against muscle damage, whereas greater protective effect was induced by 10 MVC-ISO, which can be used as a strategy to minimize muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Attenuation of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage by preconditioning exercises.\n# Abstract: This study compared the effect of an initial exercise consisting of either low-intensity eccentric or maximal isometric contractions (ISOs) on protective effect against maximal eccentric contraction (MaxECC)-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions attenuate muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise of the knee extensors in the elderly.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors would attenuate the magnitude of muscle damage induced by maximal eccentric exercise of the same muscle performed 7 days later using elderly individuals. Healthy older men (66.4 ± 4.6 years) were assigned to control or experimental (Exp) group (n = 13 per group). The control group performed six sets of ten maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC) of the knee extensors of non-dominant leg. The Exp group performed six sets of ten low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors on a leg extension machine by lowering a weight of 10 % maximal voluntary isometric knee extension strength (10 %ECC) 7 days prior to MaxECC. Changes in maximal voluntary isokinetic concentric torque (MVC-CON), angle at peak torque, range of motion (ROM), upper thigh circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin (Mb) concentration and B-mode ultrasound echo-intensity before and for 5 days after MaxECC were compared between groups by a mixed factor ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were observed following 10 %ECC. Following MaxECC, all variables changed significantly, and changes in all variables except for angle at peak torque were significantly different between groups. MVC-CON and ROM decreased smaller and recovered faster (P < 0.05) for Exp than control group, and changes in other variables were smaller (P < 0.05) for Exp group compared with control group. These results suggest that preconditioning knee extensor muscles with low-intensity eccentric contractions was effective for attenuating muscle damage induced by subsequent MaxECC of the knee extensors for elderly individuals.",
      "# Title: Effect of two maximal isometric contractions on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the elbow flexors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the time wise protective effect conferred by two maximal voluntary isometric contractions (2MVCs) at 20° elbow flexion on muscle damage induced by 30 maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors (MaxECC). Sixty-five young untrained men were randomly assigned to a control group that did not perform 2MVCs, or one of four experimental groups (n = 13 per group) who performed 2MVCs either immediately (0d), 2 (2d), 4 (4d) or 7 days (7d) before MaxECC. Changes in maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) concentric torque (MVC-CON), optimum angle (OA), range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following MaxECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were evident following 2MVCs. The 2d and 4d groups showed 16-62 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following MaxECC than the control, 0d and 7d groups. The 2d group showed 14-34 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables except for OA compared with the 4d group. The changes in the variables were similar among the control, 0d and 7d groups. These results show that 2MVCs that were performed between 2 and 4 days before MaxECC attenuated the magnitude of muscle damage, but no such effect was evident if the 2MVCs were performed immediately or 7 days before MaxECC. It is concluded that the protective effect conferred by 2MVCs is relatively short-lived, and there is a window for the effect to be conferred.",
      "# Title: Effect of a prior bout of preconditioning exercise on muscle damage from downhill walking.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether reduced-duration downhill walking (DW) would confer a protective effect against muscle damage induced by a subsequent bout of longer duration DW performed 1 week or 4 weeks later. Healthy young adults were allocated to a control or one of the preconditioning exercise (PRE-1wk or PRE-4wk) groups (10 men and 4 women per group). PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups performed 20-min DW (-28% slope, 5 km/h, 10% body mass added to a backpack) 1 week and 4 weeks before 40-min DW, respectively, and the control group performed 40-min DW only. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) knee extension torque, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity, and muscle soreness (100-mm visual analog scale) were measured before, immediately after, and 24, 48, and 72 h after DW, and the changes in these variables were compared among groups. The control group showed symptoms of muscle damage (e.g., prolonged decrease in MVC: -14% ± 10% at 48 h post-DW) after 40-min DW. Changes in all variables after 40-min DW of PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups were 54%-61% smaller (P < 0.05) than the control group, without significant differences between PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups for MVC and plasma CK activity. Importantly, changes after the preconditioning exercise (20-min DW) were 67%-69% smaller (P < 0.05) than those after the 40-min DW of the control group. These findings suggest that 20-min DW resulting in minor muscle damage conferred a protective effect against subsequent 40-min DW, and its effect could last for more than 4 weeks.",
      "# Title: Lower-volume muscle-damaging exercise protects against high-volume muscle-damaging exercise and the detrimental effects on endurance performance.\n# Abstract: This study examined whether lower-volume exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) performed 2 weeks before high-volume muscle-damaging exercise protects against its detrimental effect on running performance.",
      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors and flexors protect against muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the magnitude and duration of the protective effect of low-intensity eccentric contractions (LowEC) against damage induced by maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) of the knee flexors (KF) and extensors (KE). Young men were assigned to 8 experimental groups and 2 control groups (n = 13/group); the experimental groups performed LowEC of KF or KE 2 days (2d), 1 week (1wk), 2 weeks (2wk), or 3 weeks (3wk) before MaxEC, while the control groups performed MaxEC of KF or KE without LowEC. The 2d, 1wk, 2wk, and 3wk groups performed 30 LowEC of KF or 60 LowEC of KE with a load of 10% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction strength on a resistance-training machine, and all groups performed 30 MaxEC of KF or 60 MaxEC of KE on an isokinetic dynamometer. Several muscle damage markers were measured from before to 2 days after exercise (LowEC) or from before to 5 days after exercise (MaxEC). No significant changes in any variables were evident after LowEC. The changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2d and 1wk groups (e.g., peak creatine kinase activity: 1002 ± 501 IU/L; peak muscle soreness: 13 ± 5 mm) than for the control group (peak creatine kinase activity: 3005 ± 983 IU/L; peak muscle soreness 28 ± 6 mm) for both KE and KF. There were no significant differences between the 2d and 1wk groups or among the 2wk, 3wk, and control groups. These results show that LowEC provided 30%-66% protection against damage induced by MaxEC of KF and KE, and the protective effect lasted 1 week.",
      "# Title: Protective effect by maximal isometric contractions against maximal eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the knee extensors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) performed before maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) would attenuate muscle damage of the knee extensors. Untrained men were placed to an experimental group that performed 6 sets of 10 MVIC at 90° knee flexion 2 weeks before 6 sets of 10 MaxEC or a control group that performed MaxEC only (n = 13/group). Changes in muscle damage markers were assessed before to 5 days after each exercise. Small but significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction torque, range of motion (ROM) and plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity were evident at immediately to 2 days post-MVIC (p < 0.05), but other variables (e.g. thigh girth, myoglobin concentration, B-mode echo intensity) did not change significantly. Changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (p < 0.05) by 45% (soreness)-67% (CK) for the experimental than the control group. These results suggest that MVIC conferred potent protective effect against MaxEC-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Prevention of downhill walking-induced muscle damage by non-damaging downhill walking.\n# Abstract: Mountain trekking involves level, uphill, and downhill walking (DW). Prolonged DW induces damage to leg muscles, reducing force generating ability and muscle coordination. These increase risks for more serious injuries and accidents in mountain trekking, thus a strategy to minimize muscle damage is warranted. It has been shown that low-intensity eccentric contractions confer protective effect on muscle damage induced by high-intensity eccentric contractions. This study tested the hypothesis that 5-min non-damaging DW would attenuate muscle damage induced by 40-min DW, but 5-min level walking (LW) would not.",
      "# Title: Isometric pre-conditioning blunts exercise-induced muscle damage but does not attenuate changes in running economy following downhill running.\n# Abstract: Running economy (RE) is impaired following unaccustomed eccentric-biased exercises that induce muscle damage. It is also known that muscle damage is reduced when maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) are performed at a long muscle length 2-4 days prior to maximal eccentric exercise with the same muscle, a phenomenon that can be described as isometric pre-conditioning (IPC). We tested the hypothesis that IPC could attenuate muscle damage and changes in RE following downhill running. Thirty untrained men were randomly assigned into experimental or control groups and ran downhill on a treadmill (-15%) for 30 min. Participants in the experimental group completed 10 MVIC in a leg press machine two days prior to downhill running, while participants in the control group did not perform IPC. The magnitude of changes in muscle soreness determined 48 h after downhill running was greater for the control group (122 ± 28 mm) than for the experimental group (92 ± 38 mm). Isometric peak torque recovered faster in the experimental group compared with the control group (3 days vs. no full recovery, respectively). No significant effect of IPC was found for countermovement jump height, serum creatine kinase activity or any parameters associated with RE. These results supported the hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in markers of muscle damage. The hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in RE was not supported by our data. It appears that the mechanisms involved in changes in markers of muscle damage and parameters associated with RE following downhill running are not completely shared.",
      "# Title: Damage protective effects conferred by low-intensity eccentric contractions on arm, leg and trunk muscles.\n# Abstract: Low-intensity eccentric contractions with a load corresponding to 10% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction strength (10% EC) attenuate muscle damage in a subsequent bout of higher-intensity eccentric contractions performed within 2 weeks for the elbow flexors, knee flexors and knee extensors. However, it is not known whether this strategy could be applied to other muscles. This study investigated whether 10% EC would confer damage protective effect on high-intensity eccentric contractions (80% EC) for nine different muscle groups.",
      "# Title: Protective Effect Conferred by Isometric Preconditioning Against Slow- and Fast-Velocity Eccentric Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage.\n# Abstract: We investigated if the same isometric preconditioning protocol (IPP) attenuates the magnitude of muscle damage induced by different maximal eccentric exercise protocols in the elbow flexors. Sixty-four untrained men were assigned to either two experimental or two control groups. Participants in the experimental groups performed an IPP prior to either slow (60°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-S) or fast (180°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-F) maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC). Subjects in the control groups performed slow (ECC-S) or fast (ECC-F) MaxECC without IPP. Maximal isokinetic concentric torque (MVC), muscle soreness (SOR), and muscle thickness (MT) were assessed before, immediately after, and 1-4 days following the MaxECC. Significant (p < 0.05) group vs. time interactions were found for MVC (F = 4,517), SOR (F = 6,318), and MT (F = 1,863). The ECC-S group presented faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and MT and less (p < 0.05) SOR at 96 h post-MaxECC compared with ECC-F group. No significant differences in MVC and MT were found between ECC-S and ECC-F groups following MaxECC. The ISO + ECC-S group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and SOR compared to the ECC-S group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ECC-S in any variable. The ISO + ECC-F group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of all assessed variables compared with the ECC-F group. MVC was greater (p < 0.05) at 48-72 h, and SOR was less (p < 0.05) at 48-96 h in the ISO + ECC-F compared to the ECC-F group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ISO + ECC-F for any variable. These results show that the IPP accelerated recovery of MVC and SOR for the slow-eccentric exercise condition and attenuated strength loss and SOR in addition to faster recovery of all assessed variables for the fast-eccentric exercise condition. Therefore, the IPP can be used as a strategy to attenuate and accelerate recovery of muscle damage induced by different-velocity eccentric exercises, resulting in greater protection against muscle damage induced by faster velocity."

      "conclusionA": "Performing a prior bout of low-to-moderate volume eccentric or isometric exercise—even as little as two maximal isometric contractions or 10-50 eccentric actions—significantly attenuates subsequent exercise-induced muscle damage, typically within a window of 1-2 weeks, regardless of exercise modality (downhill walking, elbow flexors, knee extensors) or contraction velocity; however, this protective effect is not sustained beyond 2-3 weeks.",
      "conclusionB": "Performing a non-damaging, low-intensity bout of eccentric exercise, or even isometric contractions, performed between 2 and 4 days prior to a subsequent maximal eccentric exercise bout significantly attenuates markers of muscle damage, such as reduced soreness, smaller decrements in strength, and lower creatine kinase activity, demonstrating a protective effect that can last for at least 1-2 weeks."

    "referenceConclusion": "The evidence is robust for a strongly elevated risk of tuberculosis with radiological silicosis, with a low disease severity threshold. The effect estimate is more uncertain for silica exposure without radiological silicosis. Research is needed, particularly cohort studies measuring silica exposure in different settings, to characterise the effect more accurately as well as the silica exposure threshold that could be used to prevent excess tuberculosis risk. The study provides to our knowledge the first systematic review of the epidemiological evidence for an association identified at least a century ago, viz. that occupational inhalation of silica dust increases the risk of pulmonary tuberculosis in co-exposed populations. In the current era, even with less severe forms of silicosis in traditional dusty industries, the evidence remains strong for a substantially elevated risk of tuberculosis in those with radiologically diagnosed disease. While there is evidence for an elevated risk of tuberculosis in those who have not been radiologically diagnosed with silicosis, the effect size is subject to uncertainty. Further studies are needed to characterise this effect, and particularly the exposure threshold that would avoid an excess risk of tuberculosis.",

The present study defines the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis among 5424 nonsilicotic and 155 silicotic male foundry workers observed between 1967 and 1986. For the 18-year follow-up period, the following groups had statistically significant increased standard incidence rates (SIR) for pulmonary tuberculosis: silicotics, SIR = 1000 (95% CI = 272 to 2561, P less than .01); nonsilicotics employed at least 25 years, SIR = 353 (95% CI = 130 to 768, P less than .01); and for the entire cohort, SIR = 201 (95% CI = 125 to 397, P = .01).

      "# Title: Silicosis and risk of lung cancer or lung tuberculosis: a cohort study.\n# Abstract: This is a study of cancer mortality, cancer incidence, and incidence of lung tuberculosis among cases of silicosis reported to the National Swedish Pneumoconiosis Register during 1959-1977. Two occupational categories were extracted--\"mining, tunneling, and quarrying\" (n = 284) and \"iron and steel foundries\" (n = 428), respectively. Control groups were drawn from a national register of persons undergoing periodic health examinations with regard to silicosis risk. The controls were matched for occupation, age, and time of first exposure. The follow-up was performed through record-linkage operations to computerized information in Swedish Death Statistics, Swedish Cancer Register, and the Swedish Tuberculosis Index. End of follow-up was set at December 31, 1980. In cases drawn from mining, quarrying, and tunneling workers seven deaths in lung cancer were observed and two among the controls. Among iron and steel foundry workers the corresponding numbers were 10 and 6. The values for expected numbers, based on general population statistics, were 1.3 and 2.6, respectively, for these two occupational groups. When cancer incidence statistics were used, the case/control ratio for lung cancer was 2.1 for \"mining, quarrying, and tunneling\" and 0.6 for \"iron and steel foundries.\" There were 29 cases of lung tuberculosis registered among the silicosis cases during the follow-up period. Only one tuberculosis case was observed among the controls. The results demonstrate that persons with silicosis contracted in the mining, quarrying, and tunneling occupations are subject to an increased risk of lung cancer. The risk is observed when both the general population and a closely matched control population from the same occupations are used for values of reference. The results also demonstrate the high risk of persons with silicosis to contract lung tuberculosis.",
      "# Title: The epidemiology of tuberculosis in gold miners with silicosis.\n# Abstract: The elevated risk of tuberculosis in subjects with silicosis is widely accepted but has not been quantified in a population with a high prevalence of tuberculosis. In this study, a cohort of 1,153 older gold miners with and without silicosis who had not had tuberculosis have been followed for 7 yr by a routine mine surveillance program for detection of tuberculosis. One hundred seventy-eight of the men developed tuberculosis. The annual incidence of tuberculosis was 981/100,000 in the 335 men without silicosis and 2,707/100,000 in the 818 men with silicosis. The relative risk for tuberculosis was 2.8 (95% CI, 1.9 to 4.1) for men with silicosis compared with that in the men without silicosis. The incidence of tuberculosis increased from 1% per annum (pa) for the men without silicosis to 2.2% pa for the men with silicosis with Category 1 nodule profusion, 2.9% pa for those with Category 2, and 6.3% pa for those with Category 3 silicosis. This study has confirmed and quantified the high risk of pulmonary and of extrapulmonary tuberculosis in men with silicosis. The incidence of tuberculosis during this 7-yr study suggests that one quarter of these men with silicosis will have developed tuberculosis by 60 yr of age.",

      "# Title: Risk factors for pulmonary mycobacterial disease in South African gold miners. A case-control study.\n# Abstract: Pulmonary mycobacterial disease is common in miners. Risk factors for nontuberculous pulmonary mycobacterial (NTM) disease and tuberculosis (TB) in gold miners were identified in a retrospective case-control study that included 206 NTM patients and 381 TB patients of known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status diagnosed between 1993 and 1996. A total of 180 HIV-tested trauma/surgical inpatients were selected as control patients. Both HIV infection (odds ratio [OR] 3.6 for NTM and 4.5 for TB patients) and higher grades of silicosis (OR 5.0 for NTM and 4.9 for TB patients) were significantly more common in NTM and TB patients than in control patients. HIV prevalence rose in the control and both case groups during the study period. The overall HIV prevalence was 13.1% in NTM patients, 14.2% in TB patients, and 5.6% in control patients. Previous TB (OR 9.6), premorbid focal radiological scarring (OR 7.4) and a dusty job at diagnosis (OR 2.4) were additional significant risk factors for NTM disease. These findings suggest that the historically high incidence of NTM disease in miners is largely attributable to chronic chest disease from silica dust inhalation and prior TB. HIV infection has recently become an additional risk factor for mycobacterial disease in miners and is likely to become increasingly important as the HIV epidemic progresses.",

In addition, there is no reliable information on the MTB infection rate of patients undergoing different types of renal replacement therapy (RRT). We used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database to conduct a 9-year nationwide longitudinal study. Among 49 983 ESRD patients who received three renal replacement modalities, there were 562 cases of MTB infection, corresponding to an incidence rate of 3.0 per 1000 patient-years. The risk of MTB infection relative to the general population was 4.5. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the independent risk factors for MTB infection in ESRD patients are old age (hazard ratio (HR) 1.17 per 10 years, p <0.001), male gender (HR 1.37, p <0.001), silicosis (HR 5.82, p <0.001), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 1.68, p 0.012). Hyperlipidaemia (HR 0.71, p <0.001) and hypertension (HR 0.81, p 0.05) are associated with a lower infection rate. There was no effect of RRT modality on MTB infection rate.",

      "# Title: Risk assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related events using ultrasonography and transient elastography in patients with chronic hepatitis B.\n# Abstract: Cirrhosis has prognostic value. We investigated whether the combined use of ultrasonography (US) and transient elastography (TE) to diagnose cirrhosis is beneficial for the risk assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver-related events in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). A total of 9300 patients with CHB who underwent US and TE in two institutions between 2006 and 2018 were enrolled. TE value ≥13 kPa was set to indicate cirrhosis. Patients were divided into four groups: US(+)TE(+) (cirrhosis by US and TE), US(+)TE(-) (cirrhosis by US, but not by TE), US(-)TE(+) (cirrhosis by TE, but not by US) and US(-)TE(-) (non-cirrhosis by US and TE).The patients were predominantly male (n = 5474, 58.9%) with a mean age of 47.5 years. The proportions of patients with cirrhosis diagnosed by US and TE were 17.2% (n = 1595) and 13.2% (n = 1225), respectively. The proportion of patients with discordant results in diagnosing cirrhosis by US and TE was 18.7% (n = 1740). During follow-up (median: 60.0 months), HCC and liver-related events developed in 481 (5.2%) and 759 (8.2%) patients, respectively. The cumulative incidence rates of HCC and liver-related events were highest in the US(+)TE(+) group, intermediate-high in the US(-)TE(+) group, intermediate-low in the US(+)TE(-) group and lowest in the US(-)TE(-) group (overall p < .001). Cirrhosis assessed using US and TE was a major predictor of HCC and liver-related event development in patients with CHB. Cirrhosis assessed using TE seemed better in predicting HCC or liver-related events than using US, when cirrhosis diagnosis was discordant by US and TE.",

      "# Title: Lymph node metastasis is mediated by suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 in gastric cancer.\n# Abstract: Suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3), a multifunctional cytokine, is able to inhibit cell growth and migration by blocking the Janus kinase signal transducers and activators of transcription signaling (JAK/STAT) activation in oncogenesis. Although the STAT-3 expression was associated with lymph node metastasis from gastric cancer (GC), the implication of SOCS-3 expression in GC is not clearly elucidated. In this study, SOCS-3, STAT-3, and pSTAT-3 were evaluated in GC tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues of 107 patients who underwent curative surgery by immunohistochemistry. Further, SOCS-3 and STAT-3 mRNA levels were also detected simultaneously. In addition, survival analysis was performed between clinicopathologic variables and prognosis of GC patients. Finally, correlative analysis was adopted for demonstration the best predicator of the survival independent factor. From the results, we demonstrated that only the lymph node metastasis was the independent predictor of the overall survival (OS) of GC patients, although SOCS-3, STAT-3, and other variables were significantly relative to OS. With multivariate logistical regression analysis, SOCS-3, STAT-3, and the status of extragastric nodal metastasis were identified to be the independent factors of the lymph node metastasis from GC. Ultimately, the SOCS-3 was the best predicator of lymph node metastasis from GC identified with the nominal regression analysis. Therefore, SOCS-3 should be considered as a potential indicator for prediction the lymph node metastasis from GC.",

Although tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3, also known as A20) can decrease SOCS3 expression and is involved in the regulation of tumorigenesis in certain malignancies, its role in CCA remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression of SOCS3 and A20 in human CCA tissues to assess the prognostic significance of these proteins. The expression of SOCS3 and A20 was initially detected by western blot in 22 cases of freshly frozen CCA tumors with corresponding peritumoral tissues and 22 control normal bile duct tissues. Then, these proteins were investigated in 86 CCA patients by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and were evaluated for their association with clinicopathological parameters in human CCA. The results indicated that SOCS3 expression was significantly lower in CCA tumor tissues than in corresponding peritumoral biliary tissues and normal bile duct tissues. Conversely, A20 was overexpressed in CCA tissues. Thus, an inverse correlation between the expression of SOCS3 and A20 was discovered. Furthermore, patients with low SOCS3 expression or high A20 expression showed a dramatically lower overall survival rate. These proteins were both associated with CCA lymph node metastasis, postoperative recurrence and overall survival rate. However, only A20 showed a significant association with the tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage, while SOCS3 showed a significant association with tumor differentiation. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that SOCS3 and A20 were independent prognostic indicators for overall survival in CCA. Thus, our study demonstrated that SOCS3 and A20 represent novel prognostic factors for human CCA.",

      "# Title: The prognostic role of BORIS and SOCS3 in human hepatocellular carcinoma.\n# Abstract: Brother of regulator of imprinted sites (BORIS) is a DNA-binding protein that is normally expressed in the testes. However, aberrant expression of BORIS is observed in various carcinomas, indicating a malignant role for this protein. Furthermore, abolishment or reduction of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) expression directed by promoter methylation is considered significant in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) carcinogenesis. This study aims to investigate BORIS and SOCS3 expression in HCC specimens and assess the prognostic significance of these proteins.BORIS and SOCS3 expression was examined using immunohistochemistry in HCC tissues, along with corresponding paracarcinomatous, cirrhosis, hepatitis, and normal liver tissues. The expression levels of these 2 proteins in HCC were evaluated for their association with clinicopathological parameters. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves, the log-rank test, and multivariate Cox regression analysis.BORIS expression was significantly higher in HCC tissues than in normal liver tissues. In contrast, SOCS3 expression was dramatically lower in HCC tissues. BORIS expression was associated with tumor size, differentiation grade, satellite lesions, and recurrence while SOCS3 expression correlated with differentiation grade, vascular invasion, and recurrence. A significant negative correlation between BORIS and SOCS3 was observed. Patients with high BORIS expression and/or low SOCS3 expression had poorer postoperative survival. Patients with both these characteristics had the poorest prognostic outcome.BORIS and SOCS3 are promising as valuable indicators for predicting HCC prognosis.",

      "# Title: Prognostic significance of SOCS3 and its biological function in colorectal cancer.\n# Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignant tumor, in which the inflammatory microenvironment plays an important role. STAT3 signaling pathway is regarded as the \"bridge\" between inflammation and cancer, and involved in the development of CRC. SOCS3 is a key negative feedback regulator of JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Studies about SOCS3 gene in CRC are rarely reported. The purpose of this study is to determine the expression of SOCS3 in CRC tissue and its correlation with the clinical pathological characteristics and prognosis of colorectal cancers. The effects of SOCS3 on biological behavior such as apoptosis, proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor formation in nude mice were studied. We observed that SOCS3 expression was down-regulated in CRC tissues, while IL-6, pSTAT3 were up-regulated. Inflammatory cytokines IL-6 can promote the expression of STAT3 signaling pathways while inhibit the expression of SOCS3 by promoting hypermethylation of SOCS3 gene promoters. 5-Aza-cdR treatment can reverse IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway mediated down-regulation of SOCS3 in colorectal cancer cells. Low expression of SOCS3 was correlated with lymph node metastasis and advanced clinical stage. Patients with high expression of SOCS3 in colorectal cancers often indicated a relatively good prognosis. Overexpression of SOCS3 inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion and tumorigenic ability of CRC cells while increased cell apoptosis. This study demonstrated that IL-6/STAT3 signaling activation negatively regulated SOCS3 expression, which led to imbalance and sustained activation of STAT3 signaling pathway. Reduced expression of SOCS3 promoted the growth and metastasis of colorectal cancer. Thus, targeting IL-6/STAT3/SOCS3 signaling pathway may become an important treatment strategy of colorectal cancer.",

Methods: We assessed the expression of PD-L1, CD276, SOCS3, CD4 and CD8 by immunohistochemistry in tumor tissue from 74 HCC patients who underwent curative hepatectomy. Results: High expression of PD-L1 was significantly associated with high Edmondson grade (p<0.01) and elevated enzyme (p=0.037); high expression of CD276 was significantly correlated with high Edmondson grade (p=0.021); high expression of SOCS3 was significantly associated with age (p=0.026) and tumor size (p=0.041), while PD-L1 showed no significant correlation. The expression of PD-L1, CD276, SOCS3 protein and other clinicopathological factors (sex, vascular invasion, tumor number, tumor capsule, pT stage, liver cirrhosis, HBsAg, TBiL, AFP) showed no significant correlation (p>0.05). High expression of CD8 was respectively significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS) (p=0.002). There was no significantly difference between CD4 and CD8 high-expression and overall survival (OS) (p=0.100). Both high expression of PD-L1 (p=0.003) and low expression of SOCS3 (p=0.015) was significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS). But CD276 only had a trendency (p=0.166). Additionally, multivariate Cox regression models implied that PD-L1, SOCS3, as well as both CD4 and CD8 was an independent prognostic factor for OS (p<0.05). Furthermore, HCC patients with PD-L1 low-expression and SOCS3 high-expression had a better prognostic according to the different pT stages (p<0.05). Conclusions: We for the first time demonstrated that PD-L1 and SOCS3 were independent prognostic factor for HCC patients. Co-expression of low PD-L1 and high SOCS3 could be a better predictive marker for HCC patients."

A total of 80 patients with acute cerebral infarction who were treated at our hospital were randomly selected. They were divided into groups A and B. The two groups were treated with intravenous thrombolysis, while group B received sub-hypothermia treatment. Prior to treatment and at 7 days after treatment, 5 ml of venous blood was collected and stored in a freezer at -80˚C. IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 levels were detected by ELISA and compared between the groups and time-points. The results were as follows: i) At 7 days after treatment, the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in group B were significantly decreased compared with those in group A (P<0.05), while there was no significant difference of these levels between group A and B before treatment (P>0.05).

The aim of this study was to compare clinical outcome in liver transplant patients with and without iron overload. We also sought to determine the prevalence of HFE mutations in liver transplant patients with iron overload. Of 456 consecutive liver transplants, 41 explants had an hepatic iron index (HII) greater than 1.9, and these cases were compared to 41 matched liver transplant recipients without increased hepatic iron. Posttransplantation complications, along with patient and graft survival were monitored. HFE gene testing was performed using DNA-based techniques. Kaplan-Meier 5-year patient survival after LTx was significantly lower in cases with hepatic iron overload compared to matched controls without iron excess (48% vs. 77%; P =.045). Fatal infections (especially fungal) were more common in patients with iron overload (24% vs. 7%; P =.03). Of the 41 patients with a liver explant HII greater than 1.9, only 4 were C282Y homozygotes. Patients with severe hepatic explant iron overload undergoing LTx have a reduced survival compared to liver transplant recipients without explant iron excess. The reduced survival was attributable mainly to fatal bacterial and fungal infections. Despite the iron overload, HFE gene mutations were uncommon in patients with hepatic explant hemosiderosis.",

Iron overload has already been associated with increased risk of fungal infections, but it has not yet been assessed as a risk factor in liver transplantation. We retrospectively studied a cohort of 153 consecutive patients who underwent their first liver transplantation at a single center and who survived at least 7 days after transplantation. The association between various pretransplant patient characteristics, including hepatic explant iron and risk of invasive fungal infections, was analyzed by univariate and multivariate models. Iron in the hepatic explant was assessed by Perl's Prussian blue stain by a pathologist blinded to clinical outcome. During the first year after transplantation, 28 of 153 patients developed a total of 31 invasive fungal infections, of which 21 (68%) were caused by Candida, 7 (23%) by Aspergillus, 2 (6%) by Cryptococcus, and 1 (3%) by Saccharomyces. Stainable iron in the hepatic explant was found in 48 patients (31%). Stainable iron in the hepatic explant was found to be strongly and independently associated with posttransplantation fungal infections in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 3.09; 95% confidence interval 1.45-6.56; P = 0.003). Hepatic iron overload is strongly and independently associated with posttransplantation invasive fungal infections.

Serum ferritin concentration is a marker of varied pathophysiological events and is elevated with increased liver iron concentration, hepatic necroinflammation, and systemic illness, all of which may cause a deterioration in liver function and clinical status. The aim of this study was to determine whether serum ferritin concentration is an independent prognostic factor in subjects awaiting OLT. This is a dual-center retrospective study. The study cohort consisted of 191 consecutive adults with cirrhosis accepted by the Queensland (Australia) Liver Transplant Service between January 2000 and June 2006 and a validation cohort of 131 patients from University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Transplant Center. In the study cohort, baseline serum ferritin greater than 200 microg/L was an independent factor predicting increased 180-day and 1-year waiting list mortality. This effect was independent of model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), hepatocellular carcinoma, age, and sex. Subjects with higher serum ferritin had increased frequency of liver-related clinical events. The relationship between serum ferritin and waiting list mortality was confirmed in the UCLA cohort; all deceased patients had serum ferritin greater than 400 microg/L. Serum ferritin greater than 500 microg/L and MELD were independent risk factors for death.",

It has been described as a marker to identify high-risk patients awaiting liver transplantation (LT) but is also elevated in systemic immune-mediated diseases, metabolic syndrome, and in hemodialysis where it is associated with an inferior prognosis. This study analyzed whether SF is not only a predictor of liver-related mortality prior to LT but also an independent marker of survival following LT. In a dual-center, retrospective study, a cohort of 328 consecutive first-LT patients from Hannover Medical School, Germany (2003-2008, follow-up 1260 days), and 82 consecutive LT patients from Regensburg University Hospital, Germany (2003-2007, follow-up 1355 days) as validation cohort were analyzed.

Multivariate analyses identified SF ≥365 μg/L combined with transferrin saturation (TFS) <55%, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the survival after LT (SALT) score as independent risk factors for death. In patients with SF concentrations ≥365 μg/L and TFS <55%, overall survival was 54% versus 74.8% in the remaining group (P = 0.003).

Iron deposition in the liver tissue was assessed using a semi-quantitative grading system. Median age was 54 (18-82) years and 67% were male. Seventeen per cent had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Median Model for End-stage Liver Disease MELD score was 14 (6-40), ferritin was 174 μg/l (4-4597) with 36.5% had a SF ≥ μg/l. Age (OR = 1.028) and MELD score (OR = 1.158) were independently associated with WL mortality (P < 0.001), whilst SF was not (P = NS). Age (OR = 1.018), HCC (OR = 1.542) and cold ischemia time (CIT) ≥ 10 h (OR = 1.418) were independently associated with post-LT survival (P < 0.05). Explant siderosis grade <2 was seen in 376 (71.7%) patients. Patients with explant siderosis grade ≥ 2 had inferior 12-month post-LT survival (P = 0.030). Presence of graft siderosis (15.8% of patients) was not associated with survival. In conclusion, we found a limited role for SF as a prognostic indicator for pre- or post-transplant survival.",
      "# Title: Iron-related markers are associated with infection after liver transplantation.\n# Abstract: Though serum iron has been known to be associated with an increased risk of infection, hepcidin, the major regulator of iron metabolism, has never been systematically explored in this setting. Finding early biomarkers of infection, such as hepcidin, could help identify patients in whom early empiric antimicrobial therapy would be beneficial. We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients (n = 128) undergoing first-time, single-organ orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) without known iron overload disorders at 2 academic hospitals in Boston from August 2009 to November 2012. Cox regression compared the associations between different iron markers and the development of first infection at least 1 week after OLT; 47 (37%) patients developed a primary outcome of infection at least 1 week after OLT and 1 patient died. After adjusting for perioperative bleeding complications, number of hospital days, and hepatic artery thrombosis, changes in iron markers were associated with the development of infection post-OLT including increasing ferritin (hazard ratio [HR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-2.05), rising ferritin slope (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.17), and increasing hepcidin (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.05-1.93). A decreasing iron (HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.20-2.57) and a decreasing iron slope (HR, 4.21; 95% CI, 2.51-7.06) were also associated with subsequent infections. In conclusion, hepcidin and other serum iron markers and their slope patterns or their combination are associated with infection in vulnerable patient populations.

      "# Title: Iron metabolism imbalance at the time of listing increases overall and infectious mortality after liver transplantation.\n# Abstract: Liver transplantation (LT) is the best treatment for patients with liver cancer or end stage cirrhosis, but it is still associated with a significant mortality. Therefore identifying factors associated with mortality could help improve patient management. The impact of iron metabolism, which could be a relevant therapeutic target, yield discrepant results in this setting. Previous studies suggest that increased serum ferritin is associated with higher mortality. Surprisingly iron deficiency which is a well described risk factor in critically ill patients has not been considered."

      "conclusionA": "**Primary Concluding Statement:**\n\nEvidence indicates a positive association between iron overload, measured by markers like ferritin, transferrin saturation, and hepatic iron concentration, and an increased risk of infectious complications following liver transplantation, particularly in the early post-transplant period and potentially more strongly for bacterial and fungal infections. This relationship is complex, influenced by the timing of iron overload (pre- vs. post-transplant), interaction with other risk factors like immunosuppression and underlying liver disease, and the specific type of infection. While managing iron overload is crucial for overall post-transplant outcomes, including long-term graft health, definitive evidence demonstrating that standard interventions like phlebotomy or chelation therapy specifically reduce the *incidence* of infectious complications as a primary outcome is limited, though controlling iron burden is considered vital for mitigating overall risk.",
      "conclusionB": "**Primary Concluding Statement:**\n\nHepatic iron overload, assessed by hepatic iron index (HII) or stainable iron in the explant, is independently associated with significantly reduced post-liver transplant survival, primarily due to an increased risk of fatal fungal and bacterial infections, even in the absence of common HFE gene mutations."

    "referenceConclusion": "High PM 2.5 exposure is one of the most important avoidable hazards to human health. The effects on hematological systems have been less well-studied. There were fewer than 20 available entries in the web search according to the Cochrane recommendation as the damages are not easily analyzed and are mostly unnoticed. All available studies found harmful effects of long-term exposure to PM 2.5 to the hematopoietic system. Hematological parameter changes in people exposed to medium to high PM 2.5 concentrations for more than a year are summarized in Table 2 . The pathophysiology of PM 2.5 pollution may be from increased inflammatory responses affecting each hematological component. For the public, avoidance of exposure and reduction in PM 2.5 pollution should be encouraged. Interventions should be focused on the high-risk groups including the elderly with cardiovascular diseases, young children, and pregnant women. Personal facemasks can minimize inhaled small particles and reduce pollution exposure time. Air purifiers also lessen indoor pollution concentrations. Improving air quality has to be addressed for the general population. Decreasing PM 2.5 pollution is essential to prevent hematological adverse events. Further studies are needed to determine whether reducing PM 2.5 exposure can decrease these disorders. Pathophysiology of PM 2.5 effects on individual hematologic parameters and the high-risk groups.

      "# Title: Particulate matter air pollution and cardiovascular disease: An update to the scientific statement from the American Heart Association.\n# Abstract: In 2004, the first American Heart Association scientific statement on \"Air Pollution and Cardiovascular Disease\" concluded that exposure to particulate matter (PM) air pollution contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In the interim, numerous studies have expanded our understanding of this association and further elucidated the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved. The main objective of this updated American Heart Association scientific statement is to provide a comprehensive review of the new evidence linking PM exposure with cardiovascular disease, with a specific focus on highlighting the clinical implications for researchers and healthcare providers. The writing group also sought to provide expert consensus opinions on many aspects of the current state of science and updated suggestions for areas of future research. On the basis of the findings of this review, several new conclusions were reached, including the following: Exposure to PM <2.5 microm in diameter (PM(2.5)) over a few hours to weeks can trigger cardiovascular disease-related mortality and nonfatal events; longer-term exposure (eg, a few years) increases the risk for cardiovascular mortality to an even greater extent than exposures over a few days and reduces life expectancy within more highly exposed segments of the population by several months to a few years; reductions in PM levels are associated with decreases in cardiovascular mortality within a time frame as short as a few years; and many credible pathological mechanisms have been elucidated that lend biological plausibility to these findings. It is the opinion of the writing group that the overall evidence is consistent with a causal relationship between PM(2.5) exposure and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This body of evidence has grown and been strengthened substantially since the first American Heart Association scientific statement was published. Finally, PM(2.5) exposure is deemed a modifiable factor that contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.",

      "# Title: Effects of particulate matter exposure on blood 5-hydroxymethylation: results from the Beijing truck driver air pollution study.\n# Abstract: Previous studies have reported epigenetic changes induced by environmental exposures. However, previous investigations did not distinguish 5-methylcytosine (5mC) from a similar oxidative form with opposite functions, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Here, we measured blood DNA global 5mC and 5hmC by ELISA and used adjusted mixed-effects regression models to evaluate the effects of ambient PM10 and personal PM2.5 and its elemental components-black carbon (BC), aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), iron (Fe), sulfur (S), silicon (Si), titanium (Ti), and zinc (Zn)-on blood global 5mC and 5hmC levels. The study was conducted in 60 truck drivers and 60 office workers in Beijing, China from The Beijing Truck Driver Air Pollution Study at 2 exams separated by one to 2 weeks. Blood 5hmC level (0.08%) was ∼83-fold lower than 5mC (6.61%). An inter-quartile range (IQR) increase in same-day PM10 was associated with increases in 5hmC of 26.1% in office workers (P = 0.004), 20.2% in truck drivers (P = 0.014), and 21.9% in all participants combined (P < 0.001). PM10 effects on 5hmC were increasingly stronger when averaged over 4, 7, and 14 d preceding assessment (up to 132.6% for the 14-d average in all participants, P < 0.001). PM10 effects were also significant after controlling for multiple testing (family-wise error rate; FWER < 0.05). 5hmC was not correlated with personal measures of PM2.5 and elemental components (FWER > 0.05). 5mC showed no correlations with PM10, PM2.5, and elemental components measures (FWER > 0.05). Our study suggests that exposure to ambient PM10 affects 5hmC over time, but not 5mC. This finding demonstrates the need to differentiate 5hmC and 5mC in environmental studies of DNA methylation.",
      "# Title: Environmental nanoparticles are significantly over-expressed in acute myeloid leukemia.\n# Abstract: The increase in the incidence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) may suggest a possible environmental etiology. PM2.5 was declared by IARC a Class I carcinogen. No report has focused on particulate environmental pollution together with AML. The study investigated the presence and composition of particulate matter in blood with a Scanning Electron Microscope coupled with an Energy Dispersive Spectroscope, a sensor capable of identifying the composition of foreign bodies. 38 peripheral blood samples, 19 AML cases and 19 healthy controls, were analyzed. A significant overload of particulate matter-derived nanoparticles linked or aggregated to blood components was found in AML patients, while almost absent in matched healthy controls. Two-tailed Student's t-test, MANOVA and Principal Component Analysis indicated that the total numbers of aggregates and particles were statistically different between cases and controls (MANOVA, P<0.001 and P=0.009 respectively). The particles detected showed to contain highly-reactive, non-biocompatible and non-biodegradable metals; in particular, micro- and nano-sized particles grouped in organic/inorganic clusters, with statistically higher frequency of a subgroup of elements in AML samples. The demonstration, for the first time, of an overload of nanoparticles linked to blood components in AML patients could be the basis for a possible, novel pathogenetic mechanism for AML development.",

      "# Title: Increased Outdoor PM2.5 Concentration Is Associated with Moderate/Severe Anemia in Children Aged 6-59 Months in Lima, Peru.\n# Abstract: Anemia affects 1.62 billion people worldwide. Although iron deficiency is the main cause of anemia, several other factors may explain its high prevalence. In this study, we sought to analyze the association between outdoor particulate matter PM2.5 levels with anemia prevalence in children aged 6-59 months residing in Lima, Peru (n = 139,368), one of the cities with the worst air pollution in Latin America. The study period was from 2012 to 2016. Anemia was defined according to the World Health Organization (Hb < 11 g/dL). PM2.5 values were estimated by a mathematical model that combined data observed from monitors, with satellite and meteorological data. PM2.5 was analyzed by quintiles. Multiple linear and logistic regressions were used to estimate the associations between hemoglobin concentration (beta) and anemia (odds ratio) with PM2.5, after adjusting by covariates. Prevalence of anemia was 39.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 39.3-39.9). Mild anemia was observed in 30.8% of children and moderate/severe in 8.84% of children. Anemic children compared with nonanemic children are mainly males, have low body weight, higher rate of stunting, and live in an environment with high PM2.5 concentration. A slight decrease in hemoglobin (4Q B: -0.03, 95% CI: -0.05 to -0.02; 5Q B: -0.04, 95% CI: -0.06 to -0.01) and an increase in the probability of moderate/severe anemia (4Q OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.10-1.27; 5Q OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.08-1.29) were observed with increased exposure to PM2.5. We conclude that outdoor PM2.5 levels were significantly associated with decreased hemoglobin values and an increase in prevalence of moderate/severe anemia in children under 5 years old.",

In this nationwide register-based case-control study, we focus on specific components of PM2.5 in relation to childhood NHL in Denmark (1981-2013) by identifying all incidents of childhood NHL cases in the Danish Cancer Registry (n = 170) and four (cancer-free) randomly selected controls matched by date of birth and sex. We applied PM2.5 concentrations and the following sub-components: secondary organic aerosols (SOA), secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA; i.e., NO3-, NH4+ and SO42-), BC, organic carbon (OC) and sea salt. We calculated a time-weighted exposure average from birth to index-date at all addresses. Odds ratios (ORs) were adjusted for register-based socio-demographic variables. We observed adjusted ORs and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of 2.05 (1.10, 3.83) per interquartile range (IQR, 4.83 µg/m3) PM2.5 and 1.73 (0.68, 4.41) per IQR (3.71 µg/m3) SIA, 0.95 (0.71, 1.29) per IQR (0.05 µg/m3) SOA, 1.22 (1.02, 1.46) per IQR (0.39 µg/m3) BC, 1.02 (0.83, 1.26) per IQR (0.56 µg/m3) OC and 1.01 (0.79, 1.30) per IQR (0.87 µg/m3) sea salt, respectively. The estimates were attenuated after adjustment for PM2.5, whereas the OR for PM2.5 remained increased regardless of adjustment for specific components. The findings indicate that the previously observed relation between PM2.5 and childhood NHL may be related to BC (as reported in our previous study) but also partly to SIA, but the role of specific chemical components of PM2.5 remains ambiguous."

      "# Title: Lymph node metastasis is mediated by suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 in gastric cancer.\n# Abstract: Suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3), a multifunctional cytokine, is able to inhibit cell growth and migration by blocking the Janus kinase signal transducers and activators of transcription signaling (JAK/STAT) activation in oncogenesis. Although the STAT-3 expression was associated with lymph node metastasis from gastric cancer (GC), the implication of SOCS-3 expression in GC is not clearly elucidated. In this study, SOCS-3, STAT-3, and pSTAT-3 were evaluated in GC tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues of 107 patients who underwent curative surgery by immunohistochemistry. Further, SOCS-3 and STAT-3 mRNA levels were also detected simultaneously. In addition, survival analysis was performed between clinicopathologic variables and prognosis of GC patients. Finally, correlative analysis was adopted for demonstration the best predicator of the survival independent factor. From the results, we demonstrated that only the lymph node metastasis was the independent predictor of the overall survival (OS) of GC patients, although SOCS-3, STAT-3, and other variables were significantly relative to OS. With multivariate logistical regression analysis, SOCS-3, STAT-3, and the status of extragastric nodal metastasis were identified to be the independent factors of the lymph node metastasis from GC. Ultimately, the SOCS-3 was the best predicator of lymph node metastasis from GC identified with the nominal regression analysis. Therefore, SOCS-3 should be considered as a potential indicator for prediction the lymph node metastasis from GC.",

Although tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3, also known as A20) can decrease SOCS3 expression and is involved in the regulation of tumorigenesis in certain malignancies, its role in CCA remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression of SOCS3 and A20 in human CCA tissues to assess the prognostic significance of these proteins. The expression of SOCS3 and A20 was initially detected by western blot in 22 cases of freshly frozen CCA tumors with corresponding peritumoral tissues and 22 control normal bile duct tissues. Then, these proteins were investigated in 86 CCA patients by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and were evaluated for their association with clinicopathological parameters in human CCA. The results indicated that SOCS3 expression was significantly lower in CCA tumor tissues than in corresponding peritumoral biliary tissues and normal bile duct tissues. Conversely, A20 was overexpressed in CCA tissues. Thus, an inverse correlation between the expression of SOCS3 and A20 was discovered. Furthermore, patients with low SOCS3 expression or high A20 expression showed a dramatically lower overall survival rate. These proteins were both associated with CCA lymph node metastasis, postoperative recurrence and overall survival rate. However, only A20 showed a significant association with the tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage, while SOCS3 showed a significant association with tumor differentiation. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that SOCS3 and A20 were independent prognostic indicators for overall survival in CCA. Thus, our study demonstrated that SOCS3 and A20 represent novel prognostic factors for human CCA.",

However, aberrant expression of BORIS is observed in various carcinomas, indicating a malignant role for this protein. Furthermore, abolishment or reduction of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) expression directed by promoter methylation is considered significant in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) carcinogenesis. This study aims to investigate BORIS and SOCS3 expression in HCC specimens and assess the prognostic significance of these proteins.BORIS and SOCS3 expression was examined using immunohistochemistry in HCC tissues, along with corresponding paracarcinomatous, cirrhosis, hepatitis, and normal liver tissues. The expression levels of these 2 proteins in HCC were evaluated for their association with clinicopathological parameters. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves, the log-rank test, and multivariate Cox regression analysis.BORIS expression was significantly higher in HCC tissues than in normal liver tissues. In contrast, SOCS3 expression was dramatically lower in HCC tissues. BORIS expression was associated with tumor size, differentiation grade, satellite lesions, and recurrence while SOCS3 expression correlated with differentiation grade, vascular invasion, and recurrence. A significant negative correlation between BORIS and SOCS3 was observed. Patients with high BORIS expression and/or low SOCS3 expression had poorer postoperative survival. Patients with both these characteristics had the poorest prognostic outcome.BORIS and SOCS3 are promising as valuable indicators for predicting HCC prognosis.",

      "# Title: Prognostic significance of SOCS3 and its biological function in colorectal cancer.\n# Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignant tumor, in which the inflammatory microenvironment plays an important role. STAT3 signaling pathway is regarded as the \"bridge\" between inflammation and cancer, and involved in the development of CRC. SOCS3 is a key negative feedback regulator of JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Studies about SOCS3 gene in CRC are rarely reported. The purpose of this study is to determine the expression of SOCS3 in CRC tissue and its correlation with the clinical pathological characteristics and prognosis of colorectal cancers. The effects of SOCS3 on biological behavior such as apoptosis, proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor formation in nude mice were studied. We observed that SOCS3 expression was down-regulated in CRC tissues, while IL-6, pSTAT3 were up-regulated. Inflammatory cytokines IL-6 can promote the expression of STAT3 signaling pathways while inhibit the expression of SOCS3 by promoting hypermethylation of SOCS3 gene promoters. 5-Aza-cdR treatment can reverse IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway mediated down-regulation of SOCS3 in colorectal cancer cells. Low expression of SOCS3 was correlated with lymph node metastasis and advanced clinical stage. Patients with high expression of SOCS3 in colorectal cancers often indicated a relatively good prognosis. Overexpression of SOCS3 inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion and tumorigenic ability of CRC cells while increased cell apoptosis. This study demonstrated that IL-6/STAT3 signaling activation negatively regulated SOCS3 expression, which led to imbalance and sustained activation of STAT3 signaling pathway. Reduced expression of SOCS3 promoted the growth and metastasis of colorectal cancer. Thus, targeting IL-6/STAT3/SOCS3 signaling pathway may become an important treatment strategy of colorectal cancer.",

Methods: We assessed the expression of PD-L1, CD276, SOCS3, CD4 and CD8 by immunohistochemistry in tumor tissue from 74 HCC patients who underwent curative hepatectomy. Results: High expression of PD-L1 was significantly associated with high Edmondson grade (p<0.01) and elevated enzyme (p=0.037); high expression of CD276 was significantly correlated with high Edmondson grade (p=0.021); high expression of SOCS3 was significantly associated with age (p=0.026) and tumor size (p=0.041), while PD-L1 showed no significant correlation. The expression of PD-L1, CD276, SOCS3 protein and other clinicopathological factors (sex, vascular invasion, tumor number, tumor capsule, pT stage, liver cirrhosis, HBsAg, TBiL, AFP) showed no significant correlation (p>0.05). High expression of CD8 was respectively significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS) (p=0.002). There was no significantly difference between CD4 and CD8 high-expression and overall survival (OS) (p=0.100). Both high expression of PD-L1 (p=0.003) and low expression of SOCS3 (p=0.015) was significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS). But CD276 only had a trendency (p=0.166). Additionally, multivariate Cox regression models implied that PD-L1, SOCS3, as well as both CD4 and CD8 was an independent prognostic factor for OS (p<0.05). Furthermore, HCC patients with PD-L1 low-expression and SOCS3 high-expression had a better prognostic according to the different pT stages (p<0.05). Conclusions: We for the first time demonstrated that PD-L1 and SOCS3 were independent prognostic factor for HCC patients. Co-expression of low PD-L1 and high SOCS3 could be a better predictive marker for HCC patients."

      "conclusionB": "Loss of SOCS3 expression is significantly associated with poorer overall survival across multiple solid tumor types—including breast, gastric, cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocellular, and colorectal cancers—and, in some cases, predicts increased lymph node metastasis and tumor recurrence, functioning as an independent prognostic indicator alongside other established factors."

    "referenceConclusion": "Increased frailty was associated with increased odds of any Clavien–Dindo 1-4 complication. Frailty measurements may be used as an integral component of risk-assessment strategies to improve the quality and value of neurosurgical care for patients undergoing craniotomy surgery. These findings suggest that preoperative frailty assessments could assist in risk-stratifying patients undergoing open cranial surgery. Increased odds of complications in frail patients can assist decision-makers in perioperative pathway planning and with informed consent. Increased odds of complications were a statistically robust outcome across a number of subgroups and sensitivity analyses.",

      "# Title: The modified frailty index and 30-day adverse events in oncologic neurosurgery.\n# Abstract: The modified frailty index (mFI) is emerging as a leading measure for preoperative risk assessment using routinely available medical record data. Our objective was to determine if mFI predicts morbidity and mortality in the diverse national cohort of patients undergoing neurosurgery for intracranial neoplasms. We identified patients in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program who underwent oncologic neurosurgery procedures between 2008 and 2012. The mFI, ranging from 0 to 1, was calculated as the proportion of 11 possible risk factors present. We assessed the associations between mFI and 30-day mortality, neurologic and medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge in univariate and multivariable analyses and compare the index to established risk stratification techniques. A total of 9149 patients were identified. Mortality, severe medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge increased incrementally with increasing levels of frailty. Severe neurologic complications were highest in those with low frailty. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, increased frailty increased the odds of all adverse outcomes, including neurologic complications. The mFI increased the ability to predict all outcomes beyond available indices and was the most reliable predictor of neurologic complications. The mFI can be calculated from routinely collected medical record data and is predictive of 30-day adverse outcomes in a wide variety of neurosurgical oncology patients. The index may be a useful component of preoperative risk assessment with implications for shared decision-making, perioperative planning, and risk adjusted outcomes measurement in national quality registries.",

      "# Title: Frailty and outcomes after craniotomy for brain tumor.\n# Abstract: Frailty has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in a variety of surgical disciplines. Few data exist regarding the relationship of frailty with adverse outcomes in craniotomy for brain tumor resection. We assessed the relationship between frailty and the incidence of major post-operative complication, discharge destination other than home, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality after elective craniotomy for brain tumor resection. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 20,333 adult patients undergoing elective craniotomy for tumor resection in the 2012-2018 ACS-NSQIP Participant Use File. Multivariate logistic regression was performed using all covariates deemed eligible through clinical and statistical significance. 6,249 patients (30.7%) were low-frailty and 2,148 patients (10.6%) were medium-to-high frailty. In multivariate logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, BMI, ASA classification, smoking status, dyspnea, significant pre-operative weight loss, chronic steroid use, bleeding disorder, tumor type, and operative time, low frailty was associated with increased adjusted odds ratio of major complication (1.41, 95% CI: 1.23-1.60, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.32, 95% CI: 1.20-1.46, p < 0.001), 30-day readmission (1.29, 95% CI: 1.15-1.44, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (1.87, 95% CI: 1.41-2.47, p < 0.001). Moderate-to-high frailty was also associated with increased adjusted odds of major complication (1.61, 95% CI: 1.35-1.92, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.80, 95% CI: 1.58-2.05), 30-day readmission (1.39, 95% CI: 1.19-1.62, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (2.42, 95% CI: 1.74-3.38, p < 0.001).

In the interim, numerous studies have expanded our understanding of this association and further elucidated the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved. The main objective of this updated American Heart Association scientific statement is to provide a comprehensive review of the new evidence linking PM exposure with cardiovascular disease, with a specific focus on highlighting the clinical implications for researchers and healthcare providers. The writing group also sought to provide expert consensus opinions on many aspects of the current state of science and updated suggestions for areas of future research. On the basis of the findings of this review, several new conclusions were reached, including the following: Exposure to PM <2.5 microm in diameter (PM(2.5)) over a few hours to weeks can trigger cardiovascular disease-related mortality and nonfatal events; longer-term exposure (eg, a few years) increases the risk for cardiovascular mortality to an even greater extent than exposures over a few days and reduces life expectancy within more highly exposed segments of the population by several months to a few years; reductions in PM levels are associated with decreases in cardiovascular mortality within a time frame as short as a few years; and many credible pathological mechanisms have been elucidated that lend biological plausibility to these findings. It is the opinion of the writing group that the overall evidence is consistent with a causal relationship between PM(2.5) exposure and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

However, previous investigations did not distinguish 5-methylcytosine (5mC) from a similar oxidative form with opposite functions, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Here, we measured blood DNA global 5mC and 5hmC by ELISA and used adjusted mixed-effects regression models to evaluate the effects of ambient PM10 and personal PM2.5 and its elemental components-black carbon (BC), aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), iron (Fe), sulfur (S), silicon (Si), titanium (Ti), and zinc (Zn)-on blood global 5mC and 5hmC levels. The study was conducted in 60 truck drivers and 60 office workers in Beijing, China from The Beijing Truck Driver Air Pollution Study at 2 exams separated by one to 2 weeks. Blood 5hmC level (0.08%) was ∼83-fold lower than 5mC (6.61%). An inter-quartile range (IQR) increase in same-day PM10 was associated with increases in 5hmC of 26.1% in office workers (P = 0.004), 20.2% in truck drivers (P = 0.014), and 21.9% in all participants combined (P < 0.001). PM10 effects on 5hmC were increasingly stronger when averaged over 4, 7, and 14 d preceding assessment (up to 132.6% for the 14-d average in all participants, P < 0.001). PM10 effects were also significant after controlling for multiple testing (family-wise error rate; FWER < 0.05). 5hmC was not correlated with personal measures of PM2.5 and elemental components (FWER > 0.05). 5mC showed no correlations with PM10, PM2.5, and elemental components measures (FWER > 0.05).

The study investigated the presence and composition of particulate matter in blood with a Scanning Electron Microscope coupled with an Energy Dispersive Spectroscope, a sensor capable of identifying the composition of foreign bodies. 38 peripheral blood samples, 19 AML cases and 19 healthy controls, were analyzed. A significant overload of particulate matter-derived nanoparticles linked or aggregated to blood components was found in AML patients, while almost absent in matched healthy controls. Two-tailed Student's t-test, MANOVA and Principal Component Analysis indicated that the total numbers of aggregates and particles were statistically different between cases and controls (MANOVA, P<0.001 and P=0.009 respectively). The particles detected showed to contain highly-reactive, non-biocompatible and non-biodegradable metals; in particular, micro- and nano-sized particles grouped in organic/inorganic clusters, with statistically higher frequency of a subgroup of elements in AML samples.

      "# Title: Increased Outdoor PM2.5 Concentration Is Associated with Moderate/Severe Anemia in Children Aged 6-59 Months in Lima, Peru.\n# Abstract: Anemia affects 1.62 billion people worldwide. Although iron deficiency is the main cause of anemia, several other factors may explain its high prevalence. In this study, we sought to analyze the association between outdoor particulate matter PM2.5 levels with anemia prevalence in children aged 6-59 months residing in Lima, Peru (n = 139,368), one of the cities with the worst air pollution in Latin America. The study period was from 2012 to 2016. Anemia was defined according to the World Health Organization (Hb < 11 g/dL). PM2.5 values were estimated by a mathematical model that combined data observed from monitors, with satellite and meteorological data. PM2.5 was analyzed by quintiles. Multiple linear and logistic regressions were used to estimate the associations between hemoglobin concentration (beta) and anemia (odds ratio) with PM2.5, after adjusting by covariates. Prevalence of anemia was 39.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 39.3-39.9). Mild anemia was observed in 30.8% of children and moderate/severe in 8.84% of children. Anemic children compared with nonanemic children are mainly males, have low body weight, higher rate of stunting, and live in an environment with high PM2.5 concentration. A slight decrease in hemoglobin (4Q B: -0.03, 95% CI: -0.05 to -0.02; 5Q B: -0.04, 95% CI: -0.06 to -0.01) and an increase in the probability of moderate/severe anemia (4Q OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.10-1.27; 5Q OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.08-1.29) were observed with increased exposure to PM2.5. We conclude that outdoor PM2.5 levels were significantly associated with decreased hemoglobin values and an increase in prevalence of moderate/severe anemia in children under 5 years old.",

In this nationwide register-based case-control study, we focus on specific components of PM2.5 in relation to childhood NHL in Denmark (1981-2013) by identifying all incidents of childhood NHL cases in the Danish Cancer Registry (n = 170) and four (cancer-free) randomly selected controls matched by date of birth and sex. We applied PM2.5 concentrations and the following sub-components: secondary organic aerosols (SOA), secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA; i.e., NO3-, NH4+ and SO42-), BC, organic carbon (OC) and sea salt. We calculated a time-weighted exposure average from birth to index-date at all addresses. Odds ratios (ORs) were adjusted for register-based socio-demographic variables. We observed adjusted ORs and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of 2.05 (1.10, 3.83) per interquartile range (IQR, 4.83 µg/m3) PM2.5 and 1.73 (0.68, 4.41) per IQR (3.71 µg/m3) SIA, 0.95 (0.71, 1.29) per IQR (0.05 µg/m3) SOA, 1.22 (1.02, 1.46) per IQR (0.39 µg/m3) BC, 1.02 (0.83, 1.26) per IQR (0.56 µg/m3) OC and 1.01 (0.79, 1.30) per IQR (0.87 µg/m3) sea salt, respectively. The estimates were attenuated after adjustment for PM2.5, whereas the OR for PM2.5 remained increased regardless of adjustment for specific components. The findings indicate that the previously observed relation between PM2.5 and childhood NHL may be related to BC (as reported in our previous study) but also partly to SIA, but the role of specific chemical components of PM2.5 remains ambiguous."

      "# Title: Increased Outdoor PM2.5 Concentration Is Associated with Moderate/Severe Anemia in Children Aged 6-59 Months in Lima, Peru.\n# Abstract: Anemia affects 1.62 billion people worldwide. Although iron deficiency is the main cause of anemia, several other factors may explain its high prevalence. In this study, we sought to analyze the association between outdoor particulate matter PM2.5 levels with anemia prevalence in children aged 6-59 months residing in Lima, Peru (n = 139,368), one of the cities with the worst air pollution in Latin America. The study period was from 2012 to 2016. Anemia was defined according to the World Health Organization (Hb < 11 g/dL). PM2.5 values were estimated by a mathematical model that combined data observed from monitors, with satellite and meteorological data. PM2.5 was analyzed by quintiles. Multiple linear and logistic regressions were used to estimate the associations between hemoglobin concentration (beta) and anemia (odds ratio) with PM2.5, after adjusting by covariates. Prevalence of anemia was 39.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 39.3-39.9). Mild anemia was observed in 30.8% of children and moderate/severe in 8.84% of children. Anemic children compared with nonanemic children are mainly males, have low body weight, higher rate of stunting, and live in an environment with high PM2.5 concentration. A slight decrease in hemoglobin (4Q B: -0.03, 95% CI: -0.05 to -0.02; 5Q B: -0.04, 95% CI: -0.06 to -0.01) and an increase in the probability of moderate/severe anemia (4Q OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.10-1.27; 5Q OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.08-1.29) were observed with increased exposure to PM2.5. We conclude that outdoor PM2.5 levels were significantly associated with decreased hemoglobin values and an increase in prevalence of moderate/severe anemia in children under 5 years old.",

      "# Title: Residential Exposure to PM2.5 Components and Risk of Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in Denmark: A Nationwide Register-Based Case-Control Study.\n# Abstract: In a recent study, we observed an increased risk of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) associated with exposure to fine atmospheric particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon (BC). In this nationwide register-based case-control study, we focus on specific components of PM2.5 in relation to childhood NHL in Denmark (1981-2013) by identifying all incidents of childhood NHL cases in the Danish Cancer Registry (n = 170) and four (cancer-free) randomly selected controls matched by date of birth and sex. We applied PM2.5 concentrations and the following sub-components: secondary organic aerosols (SOA), secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA; i.e., NO3-, NH4+ and SO42-), BC, organic carbon (OC) and sea salt. We calculated a time-weighted exposure average from birth to index-date at all addresses. Odds ratios (ORs) were adjusted for register-based socio-demographic variables. We observed adjusted ORs and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of 2.05 (1.10, 3.83) per interquartile range (IQR, 4.83 µg/m3) PM2.5 and 1.73 (0.68, 4.41) per IQR (3.71 µg/m3) SIA, 0.95 (0.71, 1.29) per IQR (0.05 µg/m3) SOA, 1.22 (1.02, 1.46) per IQR (0.39 µg/m3) BC, 1.02 (0.83, 1.26) per IQR (0.56 µg/m3) OC and 1.01 (0.79, 1.30) per IQR (0.87 µg/m3) sea salt, respectively. The estimates were attenuated after adjustment for PM2.5, whereas the OR for PM2.5 remained increased regardless of adjustment for specific components. The findings indicate that the previously observed relation between PM2.5 and childhood NHL may be related to BC (as reported in our previous study) but also partly to SIA, but the role of specific chemical components of PM2.5 remains ambiguous."

Our objective was to determine if mFI predicts morbidity and mortality in the diverse national cohort of patients undergoing neurosurgery for intracranial neoplasms. We identified patients in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program who underwent oncologic neurosurgery procedures between 2008 and 2012. The mFI, ranging from 0 to 1, was calculated as the proportion of 11 possible risk factors present. We assessed the associations between mFI and 30-day mortality, neurologic and medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge in univariate and multivariable analyses and compare the index to established risk stratification techniques. A total of 9149 patients were identified. Mortality, severe medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge increased incrementally with increasing levels of frailty. Severe neurologic complications were highest in those with low frailty. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, increased frailty increased the odds of all adverse outcomes, including neurologic complications. The mFI increased the ability to predict all outcomes beyond available indices and was the most reliable predictor of neurologic complications. The mFI can be calculated from routinely collected medical record data and is predictive of 30-day adverse outcomes in a wide variety of neurosurgical oncology patients. The index may be a useful component of preoperative risk assessment with implications for shared decision-making, perioperative planning, and risk adjusted outcomes measurement in national quality registries.",

Few data exist regarding the relationship of frailty with adverse outcomes in craniotomy for brain tumor resection. We assessed the relationship between frailty and the incidence of major post-operative complication, discharge destination other than home, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality after elective craniotomy for brain tumor resection. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 20,333 adult patients undergoing elective craniotomy for tumor resection in the 2012-2018 ACS-NSQIP Participant Use File. Multivariate logistic regression was performed using all covariates deemed eligible through clinical and statistical significance. 6,249 patients (30.7%) were low-frailty and 2,148 patients (10.6%) were medium-to-high frailty. In multivariate logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, BMI, ASA classification, smoking status, dyspnea, significant pre-operative weight loss, chronic steroid use, bleeding disorder, tumor type, and operative time, low frailty was associated with increased adjusted odds ratio of major complication (1.41, 95% CI: 1.23-1.60, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.32, 95% CI: 1.20-1.46, p < 0.001), 30-day readmission (1.29, 95% CI: 1.15-1.44, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (1.87, 95% CI: 1.41-2.47, p < 0.001). Moderate-to-high frailty was also associated with increased adjusted odds of major complication (1.61, 95% CI: 1.35-1.92, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.80, 95% CI: 1.58-2.05), 30-day readmission (1.39, 95% CI: 1.19-1.62, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (2.42, 95% CI: 1.74-3.38, p < 0.001).

We show that, beyond the first 30 d after infection, individuals with COVID-19 are at increased risk of incident cardiovascular disease spanning several categories, including cerebrovascular disorders, dysrhythmias, ischemic and non-ischemic heart disease, pericarditis, myocarditis, heart failure and thromboembolic disease. These risks and burdens were evident even among individuals who were not hospitalized during the acute phase of the infection and increased in a graded fashion according to the care setting during the acute phase (non-hospitalized, hospitalized and admitted to intensive care). Our results provide evidence that the risk and 1-year burden of cardiovascular disease in survivors of acute COVID-19 are substantial.

We undertook a retrospective matched cohort study using a UK-based primary care database, Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum, to determine symptoms that are associated with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection beyond 12 weeks in non-hospitalized adults and the risk factors associated with developing persistent symptoms. We selected 486,149 adults with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 1,944,580 propensity score-matched adults with no recorded evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Outcomes included 115 individual symptoms, as well as long COVID, defined as a composite outcome of 33 symptoms by the World Health Organization clinical case definition. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for the outcomes. A total of 62 symptoms were significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection after 12 weeks. The largest aHRs were for anosmia (aHR 6.49, 95% CI 5.02-8.39), hair loss (3.99, 3.63-4.39), sneezing (2.77, 1.40-5.50), ejaculation difficulty (2.63, 1.61-4.28) and reduced libido (2.36, 1.61-3.47).

      "# Title: Accuracy of real-time shear wave elastography for assessing liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C: a pilot study.\n# Abstract: Real-time shear wave elastography (SWE) is a novel, noninvasive method to assess liver fibrosis by measuring liver stiffness. This single-center study was conducted to assess the accuracy of SWE in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), in comparison with transient elastography (TE), by using liver biopsy (LB) as the reference standard. Consecutive patients with CHC scheduled for LB by referring physicians were studied. One hundred and twenty-one patients met inclusion criteria. On the same day, real-time SWE using the ultrasound (US) system, Aixplorer (SuperSonic Imagine S.A., Aix-en-Provence, France), TE using FibroScan (Echosens, Paris, France), and US-assisted LB were consecutively performed. Fibrosis was staged according to the METAVIR scoring system. Analyses of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were performed to calculate optimal area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for F0-F1 versus F2-F4, F0- F2 versus F3-F4, and F0-F3 versus F4 for both real-time SWE and TE. Liver stiffness values increased in parallel with degree of liver fibrosis, both with SWE and TE. AUROCs were 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-0.96) for SWE and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.76-0.90) for TE (P = 0.002), 0.98 (95% CI: 0.94-1.00) for SWE and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.90-0.99) for TE (P = 0.14), and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.93-1.00) for SWE and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.91-0.99) for TE (P = 0.48), when comparing F0-F1 versus F2- F4, F0- F2 versus F3-F4, and F0 -F3 versus F4, respectively.",

      "# Title: Inter- and intra-operator reliability and repeatability of shear wave elastography in the liver: a study in healthy volunteers.\n# Abstract: This study assessed the reproducibility of shear wave elastography (SWE) in the liver of healthy volunteers. Intra- and inter-operator reliability and repeatability were quantified in three different liver segments in a sample of 15 subjects, scanned during four independent sessions (two scans on day 1, two scans 1 wk later) by two operators. A total of 1440 measurements were made. Reproducibility was assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and a repeated measures analysis of variance. The shear wave speed was measured and used to estimate Young's modulus using the Supersonics Imagine Aixplorer. The median Young's modulus measured through the inter-costal space was 5.55 ± 0.74 kPa. The intra-operator reliability was better for same-day evaluations (ICC = 0.91) than the inter-operator reliability (ICC = 0.78). Intra-observer agreement decreased when scans were repeated on a different day. Inter-session repeatability was between 3.3% and 9.9% for intra-day repeated scans, compared with to 6.5%-12% for inter-day repeated scans. No significant difference was observed in subjects with a body mass index greater or less than 25 kg/m(2).",

For that purpose, a confidence index based on temporal stability and SWE filling was defined to provide an automatic estimation of each scan quality: high (HG) or low (LG) grade. With this index, the intra-observer acquisition variability assessed by comparing consecutive scans of the same patient was 17% and 32% for HG and LG clips, respectively. The measurement quantification variability assessed by comparing the measurements of a radiologist with those of a trained operator and of two automatic measurements on a same clip averaged 13% and 22% for HG and LG exams, respectively. It was found that SWE measurements depend greatly on the quality of the acquired data.

The rate of reliable liver stiffness measurements was significantly higher with 2-D SWE than with TE: 99.2% versus 74.8%, p < 0.0001 (different reliability criteria used, according to current recommendations). In univariate analysis, liver stiffness measured with 2-D SWE correlated best with fibrosis stage estimated with TE (r = 0.699, p < 0.0001), followed by Forns score (r = 0.534, p < 0.0001) and King's score (r = 0.512, p < 0.0001). However, in multivariate analysis, only 2-D SWE-measured values remained correlated with fibrosis stage (p < 0.0001). The optimal 2-D SWE cutoff values for predicting significant fibrosis were 8.03 kPa for fibrosis stage ≥2 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.832) and 13.1 kPa for fibrosis stage 4 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.915), respectively. In conclusion, 2-D SWE can be used to obtain reliable liver stiffness measurements in almost all patients and performs very well in predicting the presence of liver cirrhosis.",
      "# Title: Assessment of liver fibrosis with 2-D shear wave elastography in comparison to transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse imaging in patients with chronic liver disease.\n# Abstract: Two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2-D SWE) is an ultrasound-based elastography method integrated into a conventional ultrasound machine. It can evaluate larger regions of interest and, therefore, might be better at determining the overall fibrosis distribution. The aim of this prospective study was to compare 2-D SWE with the two best evaluated liver elastography methods, transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse (point SWE using acoustic radiation force impulse) imaging, in the same population group. The study included 132 patients with chronic hepatopathies, in which liver stiffness was evaluated using transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging and 2-D SWE. The reference methods were liver biopsy for the assessment of liver fibrosis (n = 101) and magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography for the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis (n = 31). No significant difference in diagnostic accuracy, assessed as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), was found between the three elastography methods (2-D SWE, transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging) for the diagnosis of significant and advanced fibrosis and liver cirrhosis in the \"per protocol\" (AUROCs for fibrosis stages ≥2: 0.90, 0.95 and 0.91; for fibrosis stage [F] ≥3: 0.93, 0.95 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.92, 0.96 and 0.92) and \"intention to diagnose\" cohort (AUROCs for F ≥2: 0.87, 0.92 and 0.91; for F ≥3: 0.91, 0.93 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.88, 0.90 and 0.89). Therefore, 2-D SWE, ARFI imaging and transient elastography seem to be comparably good methods for non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis.",

      "# Title: Liver stiffness in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: A comparison of supersonic shear imaging, FibroScan, and ARFI with liver biopsy.\n# Abstract: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a major public health issue. The goal of this study was to assess the clinical use of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) evaluated by supersonic shear imaging (SSI), FibroScan, and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) in a cohort of NAFLD patients who underwent liver biopsy. A total of 291 NAFLD patients were prospectively enrolled from November 2011 to February 2015 at 2 French university hospitals. LSM was assessed by SSI, FibroScan (M probe), and ARFI within two weeks prior to liver biopsy. Calculations of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) were performed and compared for the staging of liver fibrosis. AUROC for SSI, FibroScan, and ARFI were 0.86, 0.82, and 0.77 for diagnoses of ≥F2; 0.89, 0.86, and 0.84 for ≥F3; and 0.88, 0.87, and 0.84 for F4, respectively. SSI had a higher accuracy than ARFI for diagnoses of significant fibrosis (≥F2) (P = 0.004). Clinical factors related to obesity such as body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2) , waist circumference ≥102 cm or increased parietal wall thickness were associated with LSM failures when using SSI or FibroScan and with unreliable results when using ARFI. In univariate analysis, FibroScan values were slightly correlated with NAFLD activity score and steatosis (R = 0.28 and 0.22, respectively), whereas SSI and ARFI were not; however, these components of NAFLD did not affect LSM results in multivariate analysis. The cutoff values for SSI and FibroScan for staging fibrosis with a sensitivity ≥90% were very close: 6.3/6.2 kPa for ≥F2, 8.3/8.2 kPa for ≥F3, and 10.5/9.5 kPa for F4.",

Our prospective study included 115 consecutive patients with suspected or alleged chronic hepatitis. Patients underwent SWE by two different operators and TE by sonographers on the same day. The correlation coefficient of the intra-class correlation test between an experienced radiologist and a third-year radiology resident was 0.878. There was a moderate correlation between SWE and TE (r = 0.511) in the diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis. The best cutoff values predicting significant hepatic fibrosis and liver cirrhosis by SWE were >1.78 m/s (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] = 0.777) and >2.24 m/s (AUROC = 0.935), respectively.

Patients with CHB infection who underwent liver biopsy were consecutively included. After exclusions, 257 patients were analyzed. Two-dimensional SWE resulted in a significantly higher rate of reliable measurements (98.1%, 252/257) than TE (93.0%, 239/257) (p = 0.011). Liver stiffness measurements of the two examinations exhibited a strong correlation (r = 0.835, p < 0.001). In patients given a confirmed histologic diagnosis, Spearman's rank coefficients were 0.520 in stage F0 (p < 0.001), 0.684 in stage F1 (p < 0.001), 0.777 in stage F2 (p < 0.001), 0.672 in stage F3 (p < 0.001) and 0.755 in stage F4 (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of 2-D SWE and TE for liver fibrosis staging (all p values > 0.05). Two-dimensional SWE had diagnostic accuracy comparable to that of TE for liver fibrosis staging. The measurements that the two techniques provide are not interchangeable.",

The purpose of this study was to perform an intra-individual comparison between 2-D shear wave elastography (2-D-SWE with a GE system) and Virtual Touch Tissue Quantification (VTTQ with a Siemens system) to assess whether these can be used interchangeably to grade fibrosis. Ninety-three patients (51 men, 42 women; mean age, 54 y) with liver disease of various etiologies (hepatitis B virus = 47, hepatitis C virus = 22; alcohol = 6, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis = 5, other = 13) were included. Using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values, liver fibrosis was classified into clinically non-significant (F0/F1) and significant (≥F2) fibrosis. Results indicated that intra-modality repeatability was excellent for both techniques (GE 2-D-SWE: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.89 [0.84-0.93]; VTTQ: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.90 [0.86-0.93]). Intra-modality classification agreement for fibrosis grading was good to excellent (GE 2-D-SWE: κ = 0.65, VTTQ: κ = 0.82). However, inter-modality agreement for fibrosis grading was only fair (κ = 0.31) using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values of fibrosis. In conclusion, although both GE 2-D-SWE and Siemens VTTQ exhibit good to excellent intra-modality repeatability, inter-modality agreement is only fair, suggesting that these should not be used interchangeably.",

    "referenceConclusion": "The evidence is robust for a strongly elevated risk of tuberculosis with radiological silicosis, with a low disease severity threshold. The effect estimate is more uncertain for silica exposure without radiological silicosis. Research is needed, particularly cohort studies measuring silica exposure in different settings, to characterise the effect more accurately as well as the silica exposure threshold that could be used to prevent excess tuberculosis risk. The study provides to our knowledge the first systematic review of the epidemiological evidence for an association identified at least a century ago, viz. that occupational inhalation of silica dust increases the risk of pulmonary tuberculosis in co-exposed populations. In the current era, even with less severe forms of silicosis in traditional dusty industries, the evidence remains strong for a substantially elevated risk of tuberculosis in those with radiologically diagnosed disease. While there is evidence for an elevated risk of tuberculosis in those who have not been radiologically diagnosed with silicosis, the effect size is subject to uncertainty. Further studies are needed to characterise this effect, and particularly the exposure threshold that would avoid an excess risk of tuberculosis.",

Two occupational categories were extracted--\"mining, tunneling, and quarrying\" (n = 284) and \"iron and steel foundries\" (n = 428), respectively. Control groups were drawn from a national register of persons undergoing periodic health examinations with regard to silicosis risk. The controls were matched for occupation, age, and time of first exposure. The follow-up was performed through record-linkage operations to computerized information in Swedish Death Statistics, Swedish Cancer Register, and the Swedish Tuberculosis Index. End of follow-up was set at December 31, 1980. In cases drawn from mining, quarrying, and tunneling workers seven deaths in lung cancer were observed and two among the controls. Among iron and steel foundry workers the corresponding numbers were 10 and 6. The values for expected numbers, based on general population statistics, were 1.3 and 2.6, respectively, for these two occupational groups. When cancer incidence statistics were used, the case/control ratio for lung cancer was 2.1 for \"mining, quarrying, and tunneling\" and 0.6 for \"iron and steel foundries.\" There were 29 cases of lung tuberculosis registered among the silicosis cases during the follow-up period. Only one tuberculosis case was observed among the controls. The results demonstrate that persons with silicosis contracted in the mining, quarrying, and tunneling occupations are subject to an increased risk of lung cancer. The risk is observed when both the general population and a closely matched control population from the same occupations are used for values of reference. The results also demonstrate the high risk of persons with silicosis to contract lung tuberculosis.",

In this study, a cohort of 1,153 older gold miners with and without silicosis who had not had tuberculosis have been followed for 7 yr by a routine mine surveillance program for detection of tuberculosis. One hundred seventy-eight of the men developed tuberculosis. The annual incidence of tuberculosis was 981/100,000 in the 335 men without silicosis and 2,707/100,000 in the 818 men with silicosis. The relative risk for tuberculosis was 2.8 (95% CI, 1.9 to 4.1) for men with silicosis compared with that in the men without silicosis. The incidence of tuberculosis increased from 1% per annum (pa) for the men without silicosis to 2.2% pa for the men with silicosis with Category 1 nodule profusion, 2.9% pa for those with Category 2, and 6.3% pa for those with Category 3 silicosis. This study has confirmed and quantified the high risk of pulmonary and of extrapulmonary tuberculosis in men with silicosis. The incidence of tuberculosis during this 7-yr study suggests that one quarter of these men with silicosis will have developed tuberculosis by 60 yr of age.",

      "# Title: Risk factors for pulmonary mycobacterial disease in South African gold miners. A case-control study.\n# Abstract: Pulmonary mycobacterial disease is common in miners. Risk factors for nontuberculous pulmonary mycobacterial (NTM) disease and tuberculosis (TB) in gold miners were identified in a retrospective case-control study that included 206 NTM patients and 381 TB patients of known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status diagnosed between 1993 and 1996. A total of 180 HIV-tested trauma/surgical inpatients were selected as control patients. Both HIV infection (odds ratio [OR] 3.6 for NTM and 4.5 for TB patients) and higher grades of silicosis (OR 5.0 for NTM and 4.9 for TB patients) were significantly more common in NTM and TB patients than in control patients. HIV prevalence rose in the control and both case groups during the study period. The overall HIV prevalence was 13.1% in NTM patients, 14.2% in TB patients, and 5.6% in control patients. Previous TB (OR 9.6), premorbid focal radiological scarring (OR 7.4) and a dusty job at diagnosis (OR 2.4) were additional significant risk factors for NTM disease. These findings suggest that the historically high incidence of NTM disease in miners is largely attributable to chronic chest disease from silica dust inhalation and prior TB.

In addition, there is no reliable information on the MTB infection rate of patients undergoing different types of renal replacement therapy (RRT). We used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database to conduct a 9-year nationwide longitudinal study. Among 49 983 ESRD patients who received three renal replacement modalities, there were 562 cases of MTB infection, corresponding to an incidence rate of 3.0 per 1000 patient-years. The risk of MTB infection relative to the general population was 4.5. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the independent risk factors for MTB infection in ESRD patients are old age (hazard ratio (HR) 1.17 per 10 years, p <0.001), male gender (HR 1.37, p <0.001), silicosis (HR 5.82, p <0.001), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 1.68, p 0.012).

This study investigated the usefulness of LSM as a predictor of HCC development in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). A total of 1,130 patients with non-biopsy-proven CHB who underwent LSM between May 2005 and December 2007 were enrolled in this prospective study. After LSM was performed, patients attended regular follow-up as part of a surveillance program for the detection of HCC. The mean age of the patients (767 men, 363 women) was 50.2 years, and the median LSM was 7.7 kPa. Six hundred seventy-two (59.5%) patients received antiviral treatment before or after enrollment. During the follow-up period (median, 30.7 months; range, 24.0-50.9 months), HCC developed in 57 patients (2.0% per 1 person-year).

We investigated the efficacy of the ELF test in predicting development of liver-related events (LREs) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). A total of 170 patients (103 men; 60.6%) with CHB who underwent LB and serological tests for determining ELFs were enrolled. All patients were followed up to monitor LRE development, defined as hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and/or liver-related death. The mean age was 45.3 years. During the follow-up period (median, 41 months), 39 (22.9%) patients experienced LREs. In patients with LREs, age, proportion of male gender, ELF test results, age-spleen-platelet ratio (ASPRI), liver stiffness (LS) value, and proportion of histological cirrhosis were significantly higher than those in patients without LREs (all P < 0.05). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves to predict LRE development were 0.808 for the ELF test, 0.732 for LS value, 0.713 for histological fibrosis stages using Batts and Ludwig's scoring system, and 0.687 for ASPRI. On multivariate analysis, along with age, the ELF test was an independent predictor of LRE development (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.438; P < 0.001). When we applied a three-tier stratification of our study population using cut-off ELF values of 8.10 and 10.40, patients with low (P = 0.002; adjusted HR: 0.045; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.006-0.330) and intermediate (P < 0.001; adjusted HR: 0.239; 95% CI: 0.122-0.469) ELF range were found less likely to develop LREs, compared to those with high ELF range.",

This study investigated whether transient elastography (TE) can identify patients with subclinical cirrhosis (SCC) who are at increased risk of developing HCC among chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients without clinical evidence of cirrhosis. A total of 2,876 CHB patients without clinical cirrhosis who received TE examinations between April 2006 and December 2012 were enrolled in this prospective study. SCC was defined as a nonclinical cirrhosis, but with a liver stiffness (LS) value ≥13 kilopascals (kPa). Mean age of the study population was 46.1 years, and male gender was predominant (n = 1,775; 61.7%). Mean LS value was 7.9 kPa, and SCC was identified in 285 (9.9%) patients. During the median follow-up period of 48.9 months (range, 6.6-96.2), HCC developed in 16 patients (13.3 per 1,000 person-years) in the SCC group and 36 (3.4 per 1,000 person-years) in the non-SCC group. Cumulative incidence rate of HCC in the SCC group was significantly higher than that in the non-SCC group (P < 0.001, log-rank test).

A total of 9300 patients with CHB who underwent US and TE in two institutions between 2006 and 2018 were enrolled. TE value ≥13 kPa was set to indicate cirrhosis. Patients were divided into four groups: US(+)TE(+) (cirrhosis by US and TE), US(+)TE(-) (cirrhosis by US, but not by TE), US(-)TE(+) (cirrhosis by TE, but not by US) and US(-)TE(-) (non-cirrhosis by US and TE).The patients were predominantly male (n = 5474, 58.9%) with a mean age of 47.5 years. The proportions of patients with cirrhosis diagnosed by US and TE were 17.2% (n = 1595) and 13.2% (n = 1225), respectively. The proportion of patients with discordant results in diagnosing cirrhosis by US and TE was 18.7% (n = 1740).

    "referenceConclusion": "Pre-conditioning significantly reduced the severity of creatine kinase release, delayed-onset muscle soreness, loss of maximal voluntary contraction force and the range of motion decrease. Pre-conditioning may prevent severe EIMD and accelerate recovery of muscle force generation capacity. The current systematic review identified that pre-conditioning activities are effective in attenuating EIMD measures, CK, muscle soreness, ROM and maximal voluntary force production. These findings suggest the use of pre-conditioning activities prior to a strenuous bout of exercise does provide a significant protective effect when performed a minimum of 24 h prior to the damaging stimulus. Furthermore, the greater improvement in MVC suggests that the pre-conditioning activities may accelerate the recovery of muscle contractile properties following strenuous exercises. However, it is unclear if pre-conditioning would prevent EIMD from more complex exercises or to what extent EIMD prevention carries over into other modes of exercise.",

      "# Title: Muscle tenderness and peak torque changes after downhill running following a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: Unaccustomed exercise (usually of an eccentric nature) is often followed by delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Previous studies have found that prior eccentric activity produces a training effect which reduces DOMS and morphological changes. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a prior bout of maximal isokinetic eccentric exercise on DOMS, strength loss and plasma creatine kinase (CK) changes following a downhill run. Ten male subjects with a mean (+/- S.D.) age of 22.5 +/- 2.8 years, body mass of 62.67 +/- 0.05 kg and height of 176 +/- 3 cm were allocated to either a treatment group or a control group. The treatment group performed 100 maximal eccentric activations of the knee extensors in the dominant leg at 0.52 rad s-1. Two weeks later, the downhill run was performed on a motor-driven treadmill. This consisted of five bouts of 8 min at a gradient of -10% at a speed corresponding to 80% of the predicted maximal heart rate. The untrained group performed the downhill run as above but without the prior isokinetic session. Tenderness measurements, plasma CK activity and concentric and eccentric isokinetic peak torque measurements of the knee extensors at 0.52 and 2.83 rad s-1 were recorded prior to, immediately following and 2, 4 and 7 days after each protocol. The isokinetic protocol caused an increase (P < 0.01) in CK and tenderness and a decrease (P < 0.05) in concentric and eccentric torque at both speeds in the treatment group. Following the downhill run, a reduction in peak torque (P < 0.01) was observed in the eccentric and concentric modes at both isokinetic speeds in the control group. For the treatment group, the decrease in peak torque occurred only at the faster eccentric speed. With the exception of the faster eccentric speed, the decrement in peak torque was greater in the control group in all post-exercise isokinetic strength tests. There was less tenderness (P < 0.01) in the trained knee extensor muscle group. Peak torque also returned to pre-downhill values earlier for the trained group. Although plasma CK activity increased in both groups after downhill running, it was much lower (P < 0.01) in the trained group. The results suggest that a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric training reduces muscle damage, reduces the amount of strength loss and decreases the sensation of DOMS after downhill running.",
      "# Title: Exercise-induced skeletal muscle damage and adaptation following repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions.\n# Abstract: Repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions were used to examine indirect indices of exercise-induced muscle damage and adaptation in human skeletal muscle. Twenty-four subjects (18 females, 6 males) aged 20.0 +/- 1.4 years (mean +/- S.D.) performed an initial bout of either 10 (n = 7), 30 (n = 9) or 50 (n = 8) maximum voluntary eccentric contractions of the knee extensors, followed by a second bout of 50 contractions 3 weeks later using the same leg. Muscle soreness was elevated after all bouts (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon test), although the initial bout reduced the soreness associated with the second bout. Force loss and a decline in the 20:100 Hz percutaneous electrical myostimulation force ratio were observed after all exercise bouts (P < 0.01). Serum creatine kinase activity was elevated following the initial bouts of 30 and 50 repetitions (P < 0.01), but there was no increase following 10 repetitions. No increase in serum creatine kinase activity was observed in any group following the second bout of contractions (P > 0.05). We conclude that skeletal muscle adaptation can be brought about by a single bout of relatively few eccentric muscle contractions. Increasing the number of eccentric muscle repetitions did not result in an increased prophylactic effect on skeletal muscle.",
      "# Title: Influence of previous concentric exercise on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether a fatiguing concentric exercise performed immediately before eccentric exercise would exacerbate eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. One arm of nine female subjects (mean +/- s: 23.3 +/- 6.7 years) performed 12 maximal eccentric actions of the elbow flexors (ECC), and the other arm performed 100 repetitions of isokinetic concentric actions of the elbow flexors followed by the same eccentric exercise (CON-ECC). The two exercise regimens (ECC and CON-ECC) were separated by 2 weeks and presented in a counterbalanced order. Changes in muscle soreness level, maximal isometric force generation, relaxed and flexed elbow joint angle, upper arm circumference and plasma creatine kinase activity were compared between the ECC and CON-ECC conditions. All measures changed significantly after both ECC and CON-ECC; however, there were significant differences in the changes between the conditions. A lower level of soreness, a faster recovery of maximal isometric force generation, a smaller decrease in relaxed elbow joint angle and a smaller increase in upper arm circumference and creatine kinase activity were evident after the CON-ECC condition compared to the ECC condition. Thus, it would seem that muscle damage was attenuated by performance of previous concentric exercise. An additional experiment using a different group of subjects (n = 5) showed that warm-up exercise before the eccentric exercise also attenuated eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.",

Male students (n = 34) were assigned to one of three groups, and with their non-dominant arm performed either 2ECC (n = 12), 6ECC (n = 10), or 24ECC (n = 12) as a first bout of exercise. Two weeks later all groups performed 24ECC. Maximal isometric strength, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration were assessed before, immediately after, and for 4 days after exercise. Changes in all variables were compared between the bouts and groups by a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance. All variables changed significantly (P< 0.05) after 2ECC, 6ECC, and 24ECC, but the amount of change after 2ECC and 6ECC was significantly smaller (P<0.05) than both 6ECC and 24ECC, and 24ECC, respectively. After the second bout, the 6ECC and 24ECC groups showed a profound repeated bout effect, and no significant differences were found between the groups. All variables except muscle soreness were significantly (P< 0.05) larger after the second bout for the 2ECC group, however the changes observed after 24ECC were significantly smaller (P < 0.01) than those observed after the first 24ECC of the 24ECC group. These results suggest that it is not necessary to conduct a high number of eccentric actions in the first bout to elicit a repeated bout effect in a subsequent bout performed some time later.",

      "# Title: Intensity of eccentric exercise, shift of optimum angle, and the magnitude of repeated-bout effect.\n# Abstract: This study compared the effect of four different intensities of initial eccentric exercise (ECC1) on optimum angle shift and extent of muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise. Fifty-two male students were placed into 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% groups (n = 13 per group), performing 30 eccentric actions of the elbow flexors of 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% of maximal isometric strength [maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)] for ECC1, followed 2-3 wk later by a similar exercise (ECC2) that used 100% MVC load. MVC at six elbow joint angles, range of motion, upper arm circumference, serum creatine kinase activity, myoglobin concentration, and muscle soreness were measured before and for 5 days following ECC1 and ECC2. A rightward shift of optimum angle following ECC1 was significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 100% and 80% than for the 60% and 40% groups, and it decreased significantly (P < 0.05) from immediately to 5 days postexercise. By the time ECC2 was performed, only the 100% group kept a significant shift (4 degrees). Changes in most of the criterion measures following ECC1 were significantly greater for the 100% and 80% groups compared with the 60% and 40% groups. Changes in the criterion measures following ECC2 were significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 40% group compared with other groups. Although the magnitude of repeated bout effect following ECC2 was significantly (P < 0.05) smaller for the 40% and 60% groups, all groups showed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced changes in criterion measures following ECC2 compared with the ECC1 100% bout. We conclude that the repeated-bout effect was not dependent on the shift of optimum angle.",
      "# Title: Repeated bout effect after maximal eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: We hypothesized that a bout of high or low volume eccentric exercise would protect against muscle damage following a subsequent high volume bout and that adaptation would be attributable to neural changes, independent of the initial exercise volume. Sixteen males performed either 45 (ECC45) or 10 (ECC10) maximal eccentric contractions using the elbow flexors, followed by an ECC45 bout 2 weeks later. Damage markers were measured for the following 96 h; EMG and work done during the first 10 eccentric contractions were also recorded. CK, soreness, and decrements in MVC and range of motion (ROM) were greater in bout 1 than bout 2 (p < 0.01). Soreness, MVC and ROM were greater after the initial ECC45 bout compared to the initial ECC10 bout and the repeated bouts of ECC45 exercise in both groups (p < 0.01). Median frequency decreased from bout 1 to bout 2 (p < 0.001), no differences between groups were observed. An ECC45 bout of maximal eccentric exercise causes more initial damage than an ECC10 bout of maximal eccentric exercise, although both confer protection from subsequent ECC45 bouts of maximal eccentric contractions, which are attributable, at least in part, to a shift in the frequency content of EMG.",
      "# Title: A light load eccentric exercise confers protection against a subsequent bout of more demanding eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that a light eccentric exercise (ECC) that does not induce a loss of muscle function and delayed onset muscle soreness would confer a protective effect against a more strenuous ECC. Eighteen young men were randomly placed into two groups: 10-40% (n=9) and 40% (n=9). Subjects in the 10-40% group performed ECC of the elbow flexors (six sets of five reps) using a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (MVC) at an elbow joint angle of 90 degrees , followed 2 days later by ECC using a dumbbell weight of 40% MVC. Subjects in the 40% group performed the 40% ECC only. Changes in MVC, range of motion (ROM), upper arm circumference (CIR), plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and muscle soreness before, immediately after, 1-5 and 7 days following the 40% ECC were compared between groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any of the criterion measures were found immediately and 1-2 days after the 10% ECC. Following the 40% ECC, the 10-40% group showed significantly (P<0.05) smaller decreases in MVC and ROM, and smaller increases in muscle soreness compared with the 40% group, but no significant differences between groups were evident for CIR and plasma CK activity. These results suggest that the 10% ECC induced some protection against a subsequent bout of 40% ECC performed 2 days later. It appears that the light eccentric exercise preconditioned the muscles for exposure to the subsequent damaging eccentric exercise bout.",
      "# Title: Protection against muscle damage following fifty drop jumps conferred by ten drop jumps.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether 10 drop jumps (DJs) would confer protective effect against muscle damage and soreness in a subsequent bout of 50 DJs. Sixteen men were randomly placed into either a group performing 1 set of 10 DJs followed by 5 sets of 10 DJs (10-50, n = 8) or another group performing 2 bouts of 5 sets of 10 DJs (50-50, n = 8) separated by 2 weeks. The DJs were performed from a box height of 0.6 m, with a 10-second interval between jumps and a 1-minute rest between sets. Jump height, peak vertical ground reaction force, ground contact time, and heart rate during DJs were measured, and blood lactate concentration was assessed before and immediately after DJs. Changes in maximal isometric (ISO) and isokinetic concentric torque (CON), vertical jump, muscle soreness, and plasma creatine kinase activity before, immediately after, and at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours following exercise were compared between groups for the first and second bouts and between the bouts by a 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance. Changes in ISO, CON, vertical jump, and muscle soreness were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller for 10 DJs compared with 50 DJs; however, no significant differences in the measures between groups were evident following the second bout. The changes in the measures following 50 DJs in the 10-50 group were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller than those following the first bout of the 50-50 group. These results suggest that 10 DJs and 50 DJs conferred the same magnitude of protective effect against muscle damage by 50 DJs.",
      "# Title: Muscle damage protection by low-intensity eccentric contractions remains for 2 weeks but not 3 weeks.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that the protective effect conferred by a low-intensity eccentric exercise against maximal eccentric exercise would not last more than a week. Untrained men (21.3 ± 1.6 years) were allocated into either a control or one of four repeated bout groups (n = 13 per group). The repeated bout groups performed 30 low-intensity eccentric contractions (ECC) of the elbow flexors with a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (10%-ECC) either 2 days, 7 days (1 week), 14 days (2 weeks) or 21 days (3 weeks) before 30 maximal eccentric contractions (Max-ECC). The control group performed Max-ECC only. Changes in maximal voluntary contraction strength, optimum angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following 10%-ECC were analysed by a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Changes in the variables following Max-ECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. The 10%-ECC did not change any variables, showing no indication of muscle damage. The changes in all variables following Max-ECC were smaller (P < 0.05) for 2-day, 1- and 2-week groups than control group, without significant differences between 2-day and 1-week groups. The 2-week group showed greater (P < 0.05) changes in all variables compared with 2-day and 1-week groups. Changes in the variables were similar between 3-week and control groups, except for muscle soreness showing smaller (P < 0.05) changes for 3-week group. These results suggest that non-damaging eccentric exercise confers a protective effect against Max-Ecc, but the effect is attenuated between 1 and 2 weeks.",
      "# Title: Two maximal isometric contractions attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVC-ISO) would attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. Young untrained men were placed into one of the two experimental groups or one control group (n = 13 per group). Subjects in the experimental groups performed either two or 10 MVC-ISO of the elbow flexors at a long muscle length (20° flexion) 2 days prior to 30 maximal isokinetic eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors. Subjects in the control group performed the eccentric contractions without MVC-ISO. No significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction peak torque, peak torque angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and myoglobin concentration, muscle soreness, and ultrasound echo intensity were evident after MVC-ISO. Changes in the variables following eccentric contractions were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2 MVC-ISO group (e.g., peak torque loss at 5 days after exercise, 23% ± 3%; peak CK activity, 1964 ± 452 IU·L(-1); peak muscle soreness, 46 ± 4 mm) or the 10 MVC-ISO group (13% ± 3%, 877 ± 198 IU·L(-1), 30 ± 4 mm) compared with the control (34% ± 4%, 6192 ± 1747 IU·L(-1), 66 ± 5 mm). The 10 MVC-ISO group showed smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following eccentric contractions compared with the 2 MVC-ISO group. Therefore, two MVC-ISO conferred potent protective effects against muscle damage, whereas greater protective effect was induced by 10 MVC-ISO, which can be used as a strategy to minimize muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Attenuation of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage by preconditioning exercises.\n# Abstract: This study compared the effect of an initial exercise consisting of either low-intensity eccentric or maximal isometric contractions (ISOs) on protective effect against maximal eccentric contraction (MaxECC)-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions attenuate muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise of the knee extensors in the elderly.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors would attenuate the magnitude of muscle damage induced by maximal eccentric exercise of the same muscle performed 7 days later using elderly individuals. Healthy older men (66.4 ± 4.6 years) were assigned to control or experimental (Exp) group (n = 13 per group). The control group performed six sets of ten maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC) of the knee extensors of non-dominant leg. The Exp group performed six sets of ten low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors on a leg extension machine by lowering a weight of 10 % maximal voluntary isometric knee extension strength (10 %ECC) 7 days prior to MaxECC. Changes in maximal voluntary isokinetic concentric torque (MVC-CON), angle at peak torque, range of motion (ROM), upper thigh circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin (Mb) concentration and B-mode ultrasound echo-intensity before and for 5 days after MaxECC were compared between groups by a mixed factor ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were observed following 10 %ECC. Following MaxECC, all variables changed significantly, and changes in all variables except for angle at peak torque were significantly different between groups. MVC-CON and ROM decreased smaller and recovered faster (P < 0.05) for Exp than control group, and changes in other variables were smaller (P < 0.05) for Exp group compared with control group. These results suggest that preconditioning knee extensor muscles with low-intensity eccentric contractions was effective for attenuating muscle damage induced by subsequent MaxECC of the knee extensors for elderly individuals.",
      "# Title: Effect of two maximal isometric contractions on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the elbow flexors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the time wise protective effect conferred by two maximal voluntary isometric contractions (2MVCs) at 20° elbow flexion on muscle damage induced by 30 maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors (MaxECC). Sixty-five young untrained men were randomly assigned to a control group that did not perform 2MVCs, or one of four experimental groups (n = 13 per group) who performed 2MVCs either immediately (0d), 2 (2d), 4 (4d) or 7 days (7d) before MaxECC. Changes in maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) concentric torque (MVC-CON), optimum angle (OA), range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following MaxECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were evident following 2MVCs. The 2d and 4d groups showed 16-62 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following MaxECC than the control, 0d and 7d groups. The 2d group showed 14-34 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables except for OA compared with the 4d group. The changes in the variables were similar among the control, 0d and 7d groups. These results show that 2MVCs that were performed between 2 and 4 days before MaxECC attenuated the magnitude of muscle damage, but no such effect was evident if the 2MVCs were performed immediately or 7 days before MaxECC. It is concluded that the protective effect conferred by 2MVCs is relatively short-lived, and there is a window for the effect to be conferred.",
      "# Title: Effect of a prior bout of preconditioning exercise on muscle damage from downhill walking.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether reduced-duration downhill walking (DW) would confer a protective effect against muscle damage induced by a subsequent bout of longer duration DW performed 1 week or 4 weeks later. Healthy young adults were allocated to a control or one of the preconditioning exercise (PRE-1wk or PRE-4wk) groups (10 men and 4 women per group). PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups performed 20-min DW (-28% slope, 5 km/h, 10% body mass added to a backpack) 1 week and 4 weeks before 40-min DW, respectively, and the control group performed 40-min DW only. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) knee extension torque, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity, and muscle soreness (100-mm visual analog scale) were measured before, immediately after, and 24, 48, and 72 h after DW, and the changes in these variables were compared among groups. The control group showed symptoms of muscle damage (e.g., prolonged decrease in MVC: -14% ± 10% at 48 h post-DW) after 40-min DW. Changes in all variables after 40-min DW of PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups were 54%-61% smaller (P < 0.05) than the control group, without significant differences between PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups for MVC and plasma CK activity. Importantly, changes after the preconditioning exercise (20-min DW) were 67%-69% smaller (P < 0.05) than those after the 40-min DW of the control group. These findings suggest that 20-min DW resulting in minor muscle damage conferred a protective effect against subsequent 40-min DW, and its effect could last for more than 4 weeks.",

      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors and flexors protect against muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the magnitude and duration of the protective effect of low-intensity eccentric contractions (LowEC) against damage induced by maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) of the knee flexors (KF) and extensors (KE). Young men were assigned to 8 experimental groups and 2 control groups (n = 13/group); the experimental groups performed LowEC of KF or KE 2 days (2d), 1 week (1wk), 2 weeks (2wk), or 3 weeks (3wk) before MaxEC, while the control groups performed MaxEC of KF or KE without LowEC. The 2d, 1wk, 2wk, and 3wk groups performed 30 LowEC of KF or 60 LowEC of KE with a load of 10% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction strength on a resistance-training machine, and all groups performed 30 MaxEC of KF or 60 MaxEC of KE on an isokinetic dynamometer. Several muscle damage markers were measured from before to 2 days after exercise (LowEC) or from before to 5 days after exercise (MaxEC). No significant changes in any variables were evident after LowEC. The changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2d and 1wk groups (e.g., peak creatine kinase activity: 1002 ± 501 IU/L; peak muscle soreness: 13 ± 5 mm) than for the control group (peak creatine kinase activity: 3005 ± 983 IU/L; peak muscle soreness 28 ± 6 mm) for both KE and KF. There were no significant differences between the 2d and 1wk groups or among the 2wk, 3wk, and control groups. These results show that LowEC provided 30%-66% protection against damage induced by MaxEC of KF and KE, and the protective effect lasted 1 week.",
      "# Title: Protective effect by maximal isometric contractions against maximal eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the knee extensors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) performed before maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) would attenuate muscle damage of the knee extensors. Untrained men were placed to an experimental group that performed 6 sets of 10 MVIC at 90° knee flexion 2 weeks before 6 sets of 10 MaxEC or a control group that performed MaxEC only (n = 13/group). Changes in muscle damage markers were assessed before to 5 days after each exercise. Small but significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction torque, range of motion (ROM) and plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity were evident at immediately to 2 days post-MVIC (p < 0.05), but other variables (e.g. thigh girth, myoglobin concentration, B-mode echo intensity) did not change significantly. Changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (p < 0.05) by 45% (soreness)-67% (CK) for the experimental than the control group. These results suggest that MVIC conferred potent protective effect against MaxEC-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Prevention of downhill walking-induced muscle damage by non-damaging downhill walking.\n# Abstract: Mountain trekking involves level, uphill, and downhill walking (DW). Prolonged DW induces damage to leg muscles, reducing force generating ability and muscle coordination. These increase risks for more serious injuries and accidents in mountain trekking, thus a strategy to minimize muscle damage is warranted. It has been shown that low-intensity eccentric contractions confer protective effect on muscle damage induced by high-intensity eccentric contractions. This study tested the hypothesis that 5-min non-damaging DW would attenuate muscle damage induced by 40-min DW, but 5-min level walking (LW) would not.",
      "# Title: Isometric pre-conditioning blunts exercise-induced muscle damage but does not attenuate changes in running economy following downhill running.\n# Abstract: Running economy (RE) is impaired following unaccustomed eccentric-biased exercises that induce muscle damage. It is also known that muscle damage is reduced when maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) are performed at a long muscle length 2-4 days prior to maximal eccentric exercise with the same muscle, a phenomenon that can be described as isometric pre-conditioning (IPC). We tested the hypothesis that IPC could attenuate muscle damage and changes in RE following downhill running. Thirty untrained men were randomly assigned into experimental or control groups and ran downhill on a treadmill (-15%) for 30 min. Participants in the experimental group completed 10 MVIC in a leg press machine two days prior to downhill running, while participants in the control group did not perform IPC. The magnitude of changes in muscle soreness determined 48 h after downhill running was greater for the control group (122 ± 28 mm) than for the experimental group (92 ± 38 mm). Isometric peak torque recovered faster in the experimental group compared with the control group (3 days vs. no full recovery, respectively). No significant effect of IPC was found for countermovement jump height, serum creatine kinase activity or any parameters associated with RE. These results supported the hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in markers of muscle damage. The hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in RE was not supported by our data. It appears that the mechanisms involved in changes in markers of muscle damage and parameters associated with RE following downhill running are not completely shared.",

However, it is not known whether this strategy could be applied to other muscles. This study investigated whether 10% EC would confer damage protective effect on high-intensity eccentric contractions (80% EC) for nine different muscle groups.",
      "# Title: Protective Effect Conferred by Isometric Preconditioning Against Slow- and Fast-Velocity Eccentric Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage.\n# Abstract: We investigated if the same isometric preconditioning protocol (IPP) attenuates the magnitude of muscle damage induced by different maximal eccentric exercise protocols in the elbow flexors. Sixty-four untrained men were assigned to either two experimental or two control groups. Participants in the experimental groups performed an IPP prior to either slow (60°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-S) or fast (180°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-F) maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC). Subjects in the control groups performed slow (ECC-S) or fast (ECC-F) MaxECC without IPP. Maximal isokinetic concentric torque (MVC), muscle soreness (SOR), and muscle thickness (MT) were assessed before, immediately after, and 1-4 days following the MaxECC. Significant (p < 0.05) group vs. time interactions were found for MVC (F = 4,517), SOR (F = 6,318), and MT (F = 1,863). The ECC-S group presented faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and MT and less (p < 0.05) SOR at 96 h post-MaxECC compared with ECC-F group. No significant differences in MVC and MT were found between ECC-S and ECC-F groups following MaxECC. The ISO + ECC-S group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and SOR compared to the ECC-S group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ECC-S in any variable. The ISO + ECC-F group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of all assessed variables compared with the ECC-F group. MVC was greater (p < 0.05) at 48-72 h, and SOR was less (p < 0.05) at 48-96 h in the ISO + ECC-F compared to the ECC-F group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ISO + ECC-F for any variable. These results show that the IPP accelerated recovery of MVC and SOR for the slow-eccentric exercise condition and attenuated strength loss and SOR in addition to faster recovery of all assessed variables for the fast-eccentric exercise condition. Therefore, the IPP can be used as a strategy to attenuate and accelerate recovery of muscle damage induced by different-velocity eccentric exercises, resulting in greater protection against muscle damage induced by faster velocity."

      "# Title: Serum Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2-binding protein for patients with chronic hepatitis B and C: a comparative study.\n# Abstract: We compared Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2-binding protein (WFA+ -M2BP) levels between patients with chronic hepatitis B (n=249) and chronic hepatitis C (n=386) based on the degree of liver fibrosis. We examined WFA+ -M2BP levels in patients with F4 (cirrhosis), F3 or more (advanced fibrosis) and F2 or more (significant fibrosis) in the two groups. We further examined the relationship between five fibrosis markers and the degree of fibrosis. The WFA+ -M2BP values ranged from 0.25 cut-off index (COI) to 12.9 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 0.34-20.0 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P<.0001). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F4 in the two groups were 2.83 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 5.03 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P=.0046). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F3 or more in the two groups were 1.79 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 3.79 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P<.0001). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F2 or more in the two groups were 1.49 COI in the hepatitis B cohort and 3.19 COI in the hepatitis C group (P<.0001). Among five liver fibrosis markers, WFA+ -M2BP had the highest correlation coefficient (rs =.629) in terms of correlation with the degree of fibrosis in the patients with hepatitis C and had the second highest rs value (.415) in the hepatitis B group. Although WFA+ -M2BP could be a useful indicator of liver fibrosis, WFA+ -M2BP levels in the two groups significantly differed even in the same degree of fibrosis. Individual cut-off values in each aetiology for the degree of fibrosis should be determined.",
      "# Title: Serum Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n# Abstract: Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein (WFA+-M2BP) has been suggested to be useful for the assessment of disease severity in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Consecutive adult NAFLD patients who had a liver biopsy were included. Serum WFA+-M2BP level was measured using a lectin-antibody sandwich immunoassay using a chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay machine (HISCL-5000, Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). The measured levels were indexed using the following equation: Cut-off index (COI) = ([WFA+-M2BP]sample-[WFA+-M2BP]NC) / ([WFA+-M2BP]PC-[WFA+-M2BP]NC), where PC = positive control and NC = negative control. Histopathological examination of liver biopsy specimen was reported according to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Clinical Research Network Scoring System. Data for 220 cases were analyzed. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of NASH was 0.65. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of steatosis grade ≥2 and 3 was 0.64 and 0.53, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of lobular inflammation grade ≥1, ≥2 and 3 was 0.57, 0.68 and 0.59, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of hepatocyte ballooning grade ≥1 and 2 was 0.64 and 0.65, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of fibrosis stage ≥1, ≥2, ≥3 and 4 was 0.61, 0.71, 0.74 and 0.84, respectively. Out of the 220 cases, 152 cases were the same 76 patients who had a repeat liver biopsy after 48 weeks of intervention. The AUROC of the change in the COI to detect improvement in steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning and fibrosis was 0.57, 0.54, 0.59 and 0.52, respectively. In conclusion, serum WFA+-M2BP was most useful for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in NAFLD patients. However, it was less useful for differentiating NASH from non-NASH, and for diagnosis and follow-up of the individual histopathological components of NASH.",
      "# Title: Serum Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2-binding protein expression predicts disease severity in chronic hepatitis C patients.\n# Abstract: Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein (WFA+-M2BP) has recently been developed as a promising liver fibrosis glyco biomarker. We assessed its efficacy in evaluating liver disease severity in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in Taiwan. The association between WFA+-M2BP and histological features was evaluated among those CHC patients underwent liver biopsy. We also aimed to clarify the factors determining the performance of WFA+-M2BP in CHC. A total of 229 CHC patients were consecutively recruited. The mean value of WFA+-M2BP in patients from F0 to F4 was 1.68, 2.23, 3.45, 3.48, 3.77 respectively (linear trend P = 0.008). Linear regression analysis revealed that alanine aminotransferase (odds ratio [OR]: 0.03, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.02-0.05, P < 0.001), AST (OR: -0.1, 95% CI: -0.02 to -0.01, P < 0.001), and liver fibrosis (OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.01-0.59, P = 0.043) were the independent factors correlated to serum WFA+-M2BP level. The optimal cutoff values of WFA+-M2BP for fibrosis stages F1, F2, F3, and F4 were 1.42, 1.61, 1.42, and 2.67, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the platelet count (OR/CI: -0.009/0.986-0.996, P = <0.001), r-glutamyl transferase (OR/CI: 0.007/1.000-1.013, P = 0.036), and WFA+-M2BP (OR/CI: 0.187/1.057-1.374, P = 0.005). We concluded that WFA+-M2BP is a competent noninvasive marker for liver fibrosis assessment in CHC patients.",

      "# Title: Comparison of serum fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B.\n# Abstract: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The diagnosis of liver fibrosis has a key role in selecting patients with CHB for antiviral treatment. However, serum biomarkers demonstrate limited diagnostic utility. The present study aimed to compare the performances of fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB and to identify the most appropriate biomarker for these patients. The current study included 96 antiviral-naïve patients with CHB who underwent liver biopsy. METAVIR scoring system was used to assess liver fibrosis and necroinflammation. The diagnostic performances were evaluated of the platelet (PLT) count; the levels of hyaluronan, serum 7S domain of type 4 collagen, procollagen type III N-terminal peptide, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1, Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) and N-terminal type III collagen propeptide (Pro-C3); the fibrosis index based on four factors; the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index; and enhanced liver fibrosis score for identifying significant liver fibrosis [≥fibrosis stage 2 (F2)]. All fibrosis biomarkers, except the Pro-C3 level, correlated with the fibrosis stage. M2BPGi was better than other biomarkers for diagnosing ≥F2, with the highest area under the curve of 0.902. M2BPGi demonstrated a higher diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis than mild/severe fibrosis or cirrhosis. However, no significant correlation was observed between the M2BPGi level and fibrosis stage in patients with CHB having significant liver necroinflammation defined as ≥ necroinflammatory activity 2. The M2BPGi level and PLT count were exclusively correlated with the fibrosis stage in 73 patients without significant liver necroinflammation. M2BPGi demonstrated the highest diagnostic performance for significant fibrosis in patients having significant liver fibrosis with no significant liver necroinflammation. In conclusion, the M2BPGi level can accurately diagnose significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB.",

      "# Title: Serum Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2-binding protein expression predicts disease severity in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients.\n# Abstract: The role of Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein (WFA+ -M2BP) in the prediction of disease severity in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains elusive. This study evaluated the performance of WFA+ -M2BP in predicting fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. A total of 80 patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) were enrolled. Serum WFA+ -M2BP levels were measured using standard methods. The fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index was also measured. The mean values of WFA+ -M2BP were 1.0, 1.0, 0.8, and 2.2 in Metavir fibrosis stage F0, F1, F2, and F3-4, respectively (linear trend p = 0.005). The optimal cut-off value of WFA+ -M2BP in predicting advanced fibrosis (F3-4) was 1.37 cut-off index (COI), yielding the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, and accuracy of 75.0, 79.4, 39.1, 94.7, and 78.7%, respectively (p < 0.001). Combining WFA+ -M2BP with FIB-4 significantly increased the diagnostic performance for advanced fibrosis, yielding specificity, PPV, and accuracy of 100, 100, and 93%, respectively. The significant factors predicting advanced liver fibrosis in the multivariate regression analysis were WFA+ -M2BP ≥ 1.37 COI (OR/confidence interval [CI]: 9.49/1.63-55.21, p = 0.01) and FIB-4 ≥ 2.80 (OR/CI: 38.18/4.89-297.93, p = 0.001). Monitoring WFA+ -M2BP is suitable for noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis in NASH patients, particularly in combination with FIB-4."

      "# Title: Prospective and randomized evaluation of ACL reconstruction with three techniques: a clinical and radiographic evaluation at 5 years follow-up.\n# Abstract: A variety of graft sources have been used for ACL reconstruction to improve functions and kinematics in ACL deficient knees. The two most commonly used autogenous grafts are the central third of the patellar tendon and the hamstring tendon constructs. The choice of different grafts and different construct influence the final clinical outcome of ACL reconstruction. The 3 groups, of 25 patients each, were generated by choosing the technique (PT tendon, 4 strand hamstring, and single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty) to utilize and followed for 5 years, with an alternate systematic sampling. Our comparison has shown significant kneeling pain in the patellar tendon with respect to the groups with hamstrings techniques. Single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty achieved subjective score significantly higher with respect to the other two groups as well as for the time to resume sport. The study confirms that patellar tendon and hamstring can be equivalent options for ACL reconstruction. This study demonstrated that a superior outcome as far as subjective clinical findings were concerned, was obtained in group III. Patients in the latter group were also able to return to sports sooner than those in the bone-patellar tendon graft group and the four-strand hamstring group.",
      "# Title: ST/G ACL reconstruction: double strand plus extra-articular sling vs double bundle, randomized study at 3-year follow-up.\n# Abstract: Several investigators have reported the presence of biomechanical, kinematic, anatomic, fiber orientation patterns and biological differences between the anteromedial bundle and the posterolateral bundle of ACL. The purpose of this prospective randomized study was to compare the clinical, instrumental and X-ray outcome of two ACL reconstruction techniques with hamstring tendons: one with a single intra-articular bundle associated to an extra-articular sling, the second with a more anatomic double-bundle technique that reproduces better the native ACL function. From an initial group of 100 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction, 72 patients (35 single bundle plus lateral plasty and 37 double bundle) were evaluated with IKDC, Tegner score, KT2000 arthrometer, Activity Rating Scale, Psychovitality Questionnaire and Ahlback radiographic score at a mean 3 years follow-up. Double-bundle group showed significantly better results regarding IKDC, ROM, Activity Rating Scale and time to return to sport. Also KT 2000 showed significant differences in objective stability. The double-bundle technique for ACL reconstruction described in this paper has demonstrated significantly better subjective, objective and functional results compared with a double-stranded hamstrings plus extra-articular sling at a minimum 3-year follow-up.",

We prospectively evaluated a series of 100 consecutive patients who underwent ACL reconstruction between 2001 and 2002. A clinical and radiological follow-up was performed at a minimum of 6 years. After 6 years, the International Knee Documentation Committee score demonstrated good-to-excellent results (A and B) in 98% of patients. However, arthrometric results using the KT-1000 demonstrated that 6/80 patients (7.5%) had >5 mm manual maximum side-to-side difference. The median Tegner activity score was 5 (range 1-9); the median Lysholm score was 96 (range 81-100); and the median subjective IKDC score was 94 (range 66-100). We reported 6/80 failures as revealed by a 2+ or 3+ pivot-shift test result and/or KT-1000 side-to-side difference of more than 5 mm.

Fifty patients who underwent ACLR with versus without ALLR were analyzed at four different time points (preoperatively and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively). For the functional outcomes, muscle strength and acceleration time (AT) were measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. Proprioception was evaluated using joint position sense and dynamic postural stability. Patient-reported outcomes were measured using the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK-11) scores. Functional performance was assessed using single-leg hop distance (SLHD) and Limb Symmetry Index. In the operated knees, quadriceps (at 6 months postoperatively, p = 0.003) and hamstring (at 6 and 12 months postoperatively, p < 0.001) strength were significantly higher in the combined ACLR and ALLR group than the isolated ACLR group.

      "conclusionB": "While LET/LER can improve rotational stability, particularly in select patient populations, its addition to ACL reconstruction is not universally beneficial; the most substantial improvements are observed in younger, active individuals with demonstrable rotational instability—especially those undergoing revision ACL reconstruction—and those without significant pre-existing osteoarthritis or untreated concomitant ligamentous injuries like PLC deficiencies."

    "referenceConclusion": "The evidence is robust for a strongly elevated risk of tuberculosis with radiological silicosis, with a low disease severity threshold. The effect estimate is more uncertain for silica exposure without radiological silicosis. Research is needed, particularly cohort studies measuring silica exposure in different settings, to characterise the effect more accurately as well as the silica exposure threshold that could be used to prevent excess tuberculosis risk. The study provides to our knowledge the first systematic review of the epidemiological evidence for an association identified at least a century ago, viz. that occupational inhalation of silica dust increases the risk of pulmonary tuberculosis in co-exposed populations. In the current era, even with less severe forms of silicosis in traditional dusty industries, the evidence remains strong for a substantially elevated risk of tuberculosis in those with radiologically diagnosed disease. While there is evidence for an elevated risk of tuberculosis in those who have not been radiologically diagnosed with silicosis, the effect size is subject to uncertainty. Further studies are needed to characterise this effect, and particularly the exposure threshold that would avoid an excess risk of tuberculosis.",

For the 18-year follow-up period, the following groups had statistically significant increased standard incidence rates (SIR) for pulmonary tuberculosis: silicotics, SIR = 1000 (95% CI = 272 to 2561, P less than .01); nonsilicotics employed at least 25 years, SIR = 353 (95% CI = 130 to 768, P less than .01); and for the entire cohort, SIR = 201 (95% CI = 125 to 397, P = .01).

      "# Title: Silicosis and risk of lung cancer or lung tuberculosis: a cohort study.\n# Abstract: This is a study of cancer mortality, cancer incidence, and incidence of lung tuberculosis among cases of silicosis reported to the National Swedish Pneumoconiosis Register during 1959-1977. Two occupational categories were extracted--\"mining, tunneling, and quarrying\" (n = 284) and \"iron and steel foundries\" (n = 428), respectively. Control groups were drawn from a national register of persons undergoing periodic health examinations with regard to silicosis risk. The controls were matched for occupation, age, and time of first exposure. The follow-up was performed through record-linkage operations to computerized information in Swedish Death Statistics, Swedish Cancer Register, and the Swedish Tuberculosis Index. End of follow-up was set at December 31, 1980. In cases drawn from mining, quarrying, and tunneling workers seven deaths in lung cancer were observed and two among the controls. Among iron and steel foundry workers the corresponding numbers were 10 and 6. The values for expected numbers, based on general population statistics, were 1.3 and 2.6, respectively, for these two occupational groups. When cancer incidence statistics were used, the case/control ratio for lung cancer was 2.1 for \"mining, quarrying, and tunneling\" and 0.6 for \"iron and steel foundries.\" There were 29 cases of lung tuberculosis registered among the silicosis cases during the follow-up period. Only one tuberculosis case was observed among the controls. The results demonstrate that persons with silicosis contracted in the mining, quarrying, and tunneling occupations are subject to an increased risk of lung cancer. The risk is observed when both the general population and a closely matched control population from the same occupations are used for values of reference. The results also demonstrate the high risk of persons with silicosis to contract lung tuberculosis.",
      "# Title: The epidemiology of tuberculosis in gold miners with silicosis.\n# Abstract: The elevated risk of tuberculosis in subjects with silicosis is widely accepted but has not been quantified in a population with a high prevalence of tuberculosis. In this study, a cohort of 1,153 older gold miners with and without silicosis who had not had tuberculosis have been followed for 7 yr by a routine mine surveillance program for detection of tuberculosis. One hundred seventy-eight of the men developed tuberculosis. The annual incidence of tuberculosis was 981/100,000 in the 335 men without silicosis and 2,707/100,000 in the 818 men with silicosis. The relative risk for tuberculosis was 2.8 (95% CI, 1.9 to 4.1) for men with silicosis compared with that in the men without silicosis. The incidence of tuberculosis increased from 1% per annum (pa) for the men without silicosis to 2.2% pa for the men with silicosis with Category 1 nodule profusion, 2.9% pa for those with Category 2, and 6.3% pa for those with Category 3 silicosis. This study has confirmed and quantified the high risk of pulmonary and of extrapulmonary tuberculosis in men with silicosis. The incidence of tuberculosis during this 7-yr study suggests that one quarter of these men with silicosis will have developed tuberculosis by 60 yr of age.",

      "# Title: Risk factors for pulmonary mycobacterial disease in South African gold miners. A case-control study.\n# Abstract: Pulmonary mycobacterial disease is common in miners. Risk factors for nontuberculous pulmonary mycobacterial (NTM) disease and tuberculosis (TB) in gold miners were identified in a retrospective case-control study that included 206 NTM patients and 381 TB patients of known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status diagnosed between 1993 and 1996. A total of 180 HIV-tested trauma/surgical inpatients were selected as control patients. Both HIV infection (odds ratio [OR] 3.6 for NTM and 4.5 for TB patients) and higher grades of silicosis (OR 5.0 for NTM and 4.9 for TB patients) were significantly more common in NTM and TB patients than in control patients. HIV prevalence rose in the control and both case groups during the study period. The overall HIV prevalence was 13.1% in NTM patients, 14.2% in TB patients, and 5.6% in control patients. Previous TB (OR 9.6), premorbid focal radiological scarring (OR 7.4) and a dusty job at diagnosis (OR 2.4) were additional significant risk factors for NTM disease. These findings suggest that the historically high incidence of NTM disease in miners is largely attributable to chronic chest disease from silica dust inhalation and prior TB. HIV infection has recently become an additional risk factor for mycobacterial disease in miners and is likely to become increasingly important as the HIV epidemic progresses.",

In addition, there is no reliable information on the MTB infection rate of patients undergoing different types of renal replacement therapy (RRT). We used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database to conduct a 9-year nationwide longitudinal study. Among 49 983 ESRD patients who received three renal replacement modalities, there were 562 cases of MTB infection, corresponding to an incidence rate of 3.0 per 1000 patient-years. The risk of MTB infection relative to the general population was 4.5. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the independent risk factors for MTB infection in ESRD patients are old age (hazard ratio (HR) 1.17 per 10 years, p <0.001), male gender (HR 1.37, p <0.001), silicosis (HR 5.82, p <0.001), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 1.68, p 0.012).

Data on outcomes in patients with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for CTO, however, are scarce. A total of 2,002 consecutive patients undergoing PCI for CTO from January 2005 to December 2013 were divided into patients with and without previous CABG, and outcomes were retrospectively assessed. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality. Median follow-up was 2.6 years (interquartile range 1.1 to 3.1). A total of 292 patients (15%) had previous CABG; they were older and had a greater prevalence of comorbidities. Procedural success was achieved in 75% and 84% of patients in the previous CABG and the non-CABG groups (p <0.001), respectively. All-cause mortality was 16% and 11% in the previous CABG and the non-CABG groups (p = 0.002), and differences were mitigated after adjustment for baseline characteristics (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86 to 1.74, p = 0.27).

All-cause death was significantly reduced in patients with procedural success, both in the previous CABG (11% vs 32%, adjusted HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.77, p = 0.005) and the non-CABG groups (10% vs 20%, adjusted HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.86, p = 0.004), with similar mortality benefits associated with successful revascularization in both groups (interaction p = 0.24). In conclusion, the relative survival benefit of successful recanalization of CTO is independent of previous CABG. However, owing to a greater baseline risk, the absolute survival benefit of successful CTO procedures is more pronounced in patients with previous CABG than in non-CABG patients.",

This study investigated the usefulness of LSM as a predictor of HCC development in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). A total of 1,130 patients with non-biopsy-proven CHB who underwent LSM between May 2005 and December 2007 were enrolled in this prospective study. After LSM was performed, patients attended regular follow-up as part of a surveillance program for the detection of HCC. The mean age of the patients (767 men, 363 women) was 50.2 years, and the median LSM was 7.7 kPa. Six hundred seventy-two (59.5%) patients received antiviral treatment before or after enrollment. During the follow-up period (median, 30.7 months; range, 24.0-50.9 months), HCC developed in 57 patients (2.0% per 1 person-year).

We investigated the efficacy of the ELF test in predicting development of liver-related events (LREs) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). A total of 170 patients (103 men; 60.6%) with CHB who underwent LB and serological tests for determining ELFs were enrolled. All patients were followed up to monitor LRE development, defined as hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and/or liver-related death. The mean age was 45.3 years. During the follow-up period (median, 41 months), 39 (22.9%) patients experienced LREs. In patients with LREs, age, proportion of male gender, ELF test results, age-spleen-platelet ratio (ASPRI), liver stiffness (LS) value, and proportion of histological cirrhosis were significantly higher than those in patients without LREs (all P < 0.05). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves to predict LRE development were 0.808 for the ELF test, 0.732 for LS value, 0.713 for histological fibrosis stages using Batts and Ludwig's scoring system, and 0.687 for ASPRI. On multivariate analysis, along with age, the ELF test was an independent predictor of LRE development (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.438; P < 0.001).

This study investigated whether transient elastography (TE) can identify patients with subclinical cirrhosis (SCC) who are at increased risk of developing HCC among chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients without clinical evidence of cirrhosis. A total of 2,876 CHB patients without clinical cirrhosis who received TE examinations between April 2006 and December 2012 were enrolled in this prospective study. SCC was defined as a nonclinical cirrhosis, but with a liver stiffness (LS) value ≥13 kilopascals (kPa). Mean age of the study population was 46.1 years, and male gender was predominant (n = 1,775; 61.7%). Mean LS value was 7.9 kPa, and SCC was identified in 285 (9.9%) patients. During the median follow-up period of 48.9 months (range, 6.6-96.2), HCC developed in 16 patients (13.3 per 1,000 person-years) in the SCC group and 36 (3.4 per 1,000 person-years) in the non-SCC group. Cumulative incidence rate of HCC in the SCC group was significantly higher than that in the non-SCC group (P < 0.001, log-rank test).

A total of 9300 patients with CHB who underwent US and TE in two institutions between 2006 and 2018 were enrolled. TE value ≥13 kPa was set to indicate cirrhosis. Patients were divided into four groups: US(+)TE(+) (cirrhosis by US and TE), US(+)TE(-) (cirrhosis by US, but not by TE), US(-)TE(+) (cirrhosis by TE, but not by US) and US(-)TE(-) (non-cirrhosis by US and TE).The patients were predominantly male (n = 5474, 58.9%) with a mean age of 47.5 years. The proportions of patients with cirrhosis diagnosed by US and TE were 17.2% (n = 1595) and 13.2% (n = 1225), respectively. The proportion of patients with discordant results in diagnosing cirrhosis by US and TE was 18.7% (n = 1740).

      "# Title: Lymph node metastasis is mediated by suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 in gastric cancer.\n# Abstract: Suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3), a multifunctional cytokine, is able to inhibit cell growth and migration by blocking the Janus kinase signal transducers and activators of transcription signaling (JAK/STAT) activation in oncogenesis. Although the STAT-3 expression was associated with lymph node metastasis from gastric cancer (GC), the implication of SOCS-3 expression in GC is not clearly elucidated. In this study, SOCS-3, STAT-3, and pSTAT-3 were evaluated in GC tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues of 107 patients who underwent curative surgery by immunohistochemistry. Further, SOCS-3 and STAT-3 mRNA levels were also detected simultaneously. In addition, survival analysis was performed between clinicopathologic variables and prognosis of GC patients. Finally, correlative analysis was adopted for demonstration the best predicator of the survival independent factor. From the results, we demonstrated that only the lymph node metastasis was the independent predictor of the overall survival (OS) of GC patients, although SOCS-3, STAT-3, and other variables were significantly relative to OS. With multivariate logistical regression analysis, SOCS-3, STAT-3, and the status of extragastric nodal metastasis were identified to be the independent factors of the lymph node metastasis from GC. Ultimately, the SOCS-3 was the best predicator of lymph node metastasis from GC identified with the nominal regression analysis. Therefore, SOCS-3 should be considered as a potential indicator for prediction the lymph node metastasis from GC.",

Although tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3, also known as A20) can decrease SOCS3 expression and is involved in the regulation of tumorigenesis in certain malignancies, its role in CCA remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression of SOCS3 and A20 in human CCA tissues to assess the prognostic significance of these proteins. The expression of SOCS3 and A20 was initially detected by western blot in 22 cases of freshly frozen CCA tumors with corresponding peritumoral tissues and 22 control normal bile duct tissues. Then, these proteins were investigated in 86 CCA patients by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and were evaluated for their association with clinicopathological parameters in human CCA. The results indicated that SOCS3 expression was significantly lower in CCA tumor tissues than in corresponding peritumoral biliary tissues and normal bile duct tissues. Conversely, A20 was overexpressed in CCA tissues. Thus, an inverse correlation between the expression of SOCS3 and A20 was discovered. Furthermore, patients with low SOCS3 expression or high A20 expression showed a dramatically lower overall survival rate. These proteins were both associated with CCA lymph node metastasis, postoperative recurrence and overall survival rate. However, only A20 showed a significant association with the tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage, while SOCS3 showed a significant association with tumor differentiation. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that SOCS3 and A20 were independent prognostic indicators for overall survival in CCA. Thus, our study demonstrated that SOCS3 and A20 represent novel prognostic factors for human CCA.",

However, aberrant expression of BORIS is observed in various carcinomas, indicating a malignant role for this protein. Furthermore, abolishment or reduction of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) expression directed by promoter methylation is considered significant in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) carcinogenesis. This study aims to investigate BORIS and SOCS3 expression in HCC specimens and assess the prognostic significance of these proteins.BORIS and SOCS3 expression was examined using immunohistochemistry in HCC tissues, along with corresponding paracarcinomatous, cirrhosis, hepatitis, and normal liver tissues. The expression levels of these 2 proteins in HCC were evaluated for their association with clinicopathological parameters. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves, the log-rank test, and multivariate Cox regression analysis.BORIS expression was significantly higher in HCC tissues than in normal liver tissues. In contrast, SOCS3 expression was dramatically lower in HCC tissues. BORIS expression was associated with tumor size, differentiation grade, satellite lesions, and recurrence while SOCS3 expression correlated with differentiation grade, vascular invasion, and recurrence. A significant negative correlation between BORIS and SOCS3 was observed. Patients with high BORIS expression and/or low SOCS3 expression had poorer postoperative survival. Patients with both these characteristics had the poorest prognostic outcome.BORIS and SOCS3 are promising as valuable indicators for predicting HCC prognosis.",

      "# Title: Prognostic significance of SOCS3 and its biological function in colorectal cancer.\n# Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignant tumor, in which the inflammatory microenvironment plays an important role. STAT3 signaling pathway is regarded as the \"bridge\" between inflammation and cancer, and involved in the development of CRC. SOCS3 is a key negative feedback regulator of JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Studies about SOCS3 gene in CRC are rarely reported. The purpose of this study is to determine the expression of SOCS3 in CRC tissue and its correlation with the clinical pathological characteristics and prognosis of colorectal cancers. The effects of SOCS3 on biological behavior such as apoptosis, proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor formation in nude mice were studied. We observed that SOCS3 expression was down-regulated in CRC tissues, while IL-6, pSTAT3 were up-regulated. Inflammatory cytokines IL-6 can promote the expression of STAT3 signaling pathways while inhibit the expression of SOCS3 by promoting hypermethylation of SOCS3 gene promoters. 5-Aza-cdR treatment can reverse IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway mediated down-regulation of SOCS3 in colorectal cancer cells. Low expression of SOCS3 was correlated with lymph node metastasis and advanced clinical stage. Patients with high expression of SOCS3 in colorectal cancers often indicated a relatively good prognosis. Overexpression of SOCS3 inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion and tumorigenic ability of CRC cells while increased cell apoptosis. This study demonstrated that IL-6/STAT3 signaling activation negatively regulated SOCS3 expression, which led to imbalance and sustained activation of STAT3 signaling pathway. Reduced expression of SOCS3 promoted the growth and metastasis of colorectal cancer. Thus, targeting IL-6/STAT3/SOCS3 signaling pathway may become an important treatment strategy of colorectal cancer.",

Methods: We assessed the expression of PD-L1, CD276, SOCS3, CD4 and CD8 by immunohistochemistry in tumor tissue from 74 HCC patients who underwent curative hepatectomy. Results: High expression of PD-L1 was significantly associated with high Edmondson grade (p<0.01) and elevated enzyme (p=0.037); high expression of CD276 was significantly correlated with high Edmondson grade (p=0.021); high expression of SOCS3 was significantly associated with age (p=0.026) and tumor size (p=0.041), while PD-L1 showed no significant correlation. The expression of PD-L1, CD276, SOCS3 protein and other clinicopathological factors (sex, vascular invasion, tumor number, tumor capsule, pT stage, liver cirrhosis, HBsAg, TBiL, AFP) showed no significant correlation (p>0.05). High expression of CD8 was respectively significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS) (p=0.002). There was no significantly difference between CD4 and CD8 high-expression and overall survival (OS) (p=0.100). Both high expression of PD-L1 (p=0.003) and low expression of SOCS3 (p=0.015) was significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS). But CD276 only had a trendency (p=0.166). Additionally, multivariate Cox regression models implied that PD-L1, SOCS3, as well as both CD4 and CD8 was an independent prognostic factor for OS (p<0.05). Furthermore, HCC patients with PD-L1 low-expression and SOCS3 high-expression had a better prognostic according to the different pT stages (p<0.05). Conclusions: We for the first time demonstrated that PD-L1 and SOCS3 were independent prognostic factor for HCC patients. Co-expression of low PD-L1 and high SOCS3 could be a better predictive marker for HCC patients."

Among five liver fibrosis markers, WFA+ -M2BP had the highest correlation coefficient (rs =.629) in terms of correlation with the degree of fibrosis in the patients with hepatitis C and had the second highest rs value (.415) in the hepatitis B group. Although WFA+ -M2BP could be a useful indicator of liver fibrosis, WFA+ -M2BP levels in the two groups significantly differed even in the same degree of fibrosis. Individual cut-off values in each aetiology for the degree of fibrosis should be determined.",
      "# Title: Serum Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n# Abstract: Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein (WFA+-M2BP) has been suggested to be useful for the assessment of disease severity in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Consecutive adult NAFLD patients who had a liver biopsy were included. Serum WFA+-M2BP level was measured using a lectin-antibody sandwich immunoassay using a chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay machine (HISCL-5000, Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). The measured levels were indexed using the following equation: Cut-off index (COI) = ([WFA+-M2BP]sample-[WFA+-M2BP]NC) / ([WFA+-M2BP]PC-[WFA+-M2BP]NC), where PC = positive control and NC = negative control. Histopathological examination of liver biopsy specimen was reported according to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Clinical Research Network Scoring System. Data for 220 cases were analyzed. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of NASH was 0.65. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of steatosis grade ≥2 and 3 was 0.64 and 0.53, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of lobular inflammation grade ≥1, ≥2 and 3 was 0.57, 0.68 and 0.59, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of hepatocyte ballooning grade ≥1 and 2 was 0.64 and 0.65, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of fibrosis stage ≥1, ≥2, ≥3 and 4 was 0.61, 0.71, 0.74 and 0.84, respectively. Out of the 220 cases, 152 cases were the same 76 patients who had a repeat liver biopsy after 48 weeks of intervention. The AUROC of the change in the COI to detect improvement in steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning and fibrosis was 0.57, 0.54, 0.59 and 0.52, respectively. In conclusion, serum WFA+-M2BP was most useful for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in NAFLD patients. However, it was less useful for differentiating NASH from non-NASH, and for diagnosis and follow-up of the individual histopathological components of NASH.",
      "# Title: Serum Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2-binding protein expression predicts disease severity in chronic hepatitis C patients.\n# Abstract: Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein (WFA+-M2BP) has recently been developed as a promising liver fibrosis glyco biomarker. We assessed its efficacy in evaluating liver disease severity in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in Taiwan. The association between WFA+-M2BP and histological features was evaluated among those CHC patients underwent liver biopsy. We also aimed to clarify the factors determining the performance of WFA+-M2BP in CHC. A total of 229 CHC patients were consecutively recruited. The mean value of WFA+-M2BP in patients from F0 to F4 was 1.68, 2.23, 3.45, 3.48, 3.77 respectively (linear trend P = 0.008). Linear regression analysis revealed that alanine aminotransferase (odds ratio [OR]: 0.03, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.02-0.05, P < 0.001), AST (OR: -0.1, 95% CI: -0.02 to -0.01, P < 0.001), and liver fibrosis (OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.01-0.59, P = 0.043) were the independent factors correlated to serum WFA+-M2BP level. The optimal cutoff values of WFA+-M2BP for fibrosis stages F1, F2, F3, and F4 were 1.42, 1.61, 1.42, and 2.67, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the platelet count (OR/CI: -0.009/0.986-0.996, P = <0.001), r-glutamyl transferase (OR/CI: 0.007/1.000-1.013, P = 0.036), and WFA+-M2BP (OR/CI: 0.187/1.057-1.374, P = 0.005). We concluded that WFA+-M2BP is a competent noninvasive marker for liver fibrosis assessment in CHC patients.",

      "# Title: Comparison of serum fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B.\n# Abstract: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The diagnosis of liver fibrosis has a key role in selecting patients with CHB for antiviral treatment. However, serum biomarkers demonstrate limited diagnostic utility. The present study aimed to compare the performances of fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB and to identify the most appropriate biomarker for these patients. The current study included 96 antiviral-naïve patients with CHB who underwent liver biopsy. METAVIR scoring system was used to assess liver fibrosis and necroinflammation. The diagnostic performances were evaluated of the platelet (PLT) count; the levels of hyaluronan, serum 7S domain of type 4 collagen, procollagen type III N-terminal peptide, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1, Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) and N-terminal type III collagen propeptide (Pro-C3); the fibrosis index based on four factors; the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index; and enhanced liver fibrosis score for identifying significant liver fibrosis [≥fibrosis stage 2 (F2)]. All fibrosis biomarkers, except the Pro-C3 level, correlated with the fibrosis stage. M2BPGi was better than other biomarkers for diagnosing ≥F2, with the highest area under the curve of 0.902. M2BPGi demonstrated a higher diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis than mild/severe fibrosis or cirrhosis. However, no significant correlation was observed between the M2BPGi level and fibrosis stage in patients with CHB having significant liver necroinflammation defined as ≥ necroinflammatory activity 2. The M2BPGi level and PLT count were exclusively correlated with the fibrosis stage in 73 patients without significant liver necroinflammation. M2BPGi demonstrated the highest diagnostic performance for significant fibrosis in patients having significant liver fibrosis with no significant liver necroinflammation. In conclusion, the M2BPGi level can accurately diagnose significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB.",

This study evaluated the performance of WFA+ -M2BP in predicting fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. A total of 80 patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) were enrolled. Serum WFA+ -M2BP levels were measured using standard methods. The fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index was also measured. The mean values of WFA+ -M2BP were 1.0, 1.0, 0.8, and 2.2 in Metavir fibrosis stage F0, F1, F2, and F3-4, respectively (linear trend p = 0.005). The optimal cut-off value of WFA+ -M2BP in predicting advanced fibrosis (F3-4) was 1.37 cut-off index (COI), yielding the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, and accuracy of 75.0, 79.4, 39.1, 94.7, and 78.7%, respectively (p < 0.001). Combining WFA+ -M2BP with FIB-4 significantly increased the diagnostic performance for advanced fibrosis, yielding specificity, PPV, and accuracy of 100, 100, and 93%, respectively. The significant factors predicting advanced liver fibrosis in the multivariate regression analysis were WFA+ -M2BP ≥ 1.37 COI (OR/confidence interval [CI]: 9.49/1.63-55.21, p = 0.01) and FIB-4 ≥ 2.80 (OR/CI: 38.18/4.89-297.93, p = 0.001).

Although the STAT-3 expression was associated with lymph node metastasis from gastric cancer (GC), the implication of SOCS-3 expression in GC is not clearly elucidated. In this study, SOCS-3, STAT-3, and pSTAT-3 were evaluated in GC tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues of 107 patients who underwent curative surgery by immunohistochemistry. Further, SOCS-3 and STAT-3 mRNA levels were also detected simultaneously. In addition, survival analysis was performed between clinicopathologic variables and prognosis of GC patients. Finally, correlative analysis was adopted for demonstration the best predicator of the survival independent factor. From the results, we demonstrated that only the lymph node metastasis was the independent predictor of the overall survival (OS) of GC patients, although SOCS-3, STAT-3, and other variables were significantly relative to OS. With multivariate logistical regression analysis, SOCS-3, STAT-3, and the status of extragastric nodal metastasis were identified to be the independent factors of the lymph node metastasis from GC. Ultimately, the SOCS-3 was the best predicator of lymph node metastasis from GC identified with the nominal regression analysis.

Although tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3, also known as A20) can decrease SOCS3 expression and is involved in the regulation of tumorigenesis in certain malignancies, its role in CCA remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression of SOCS3 and A20 in human CCA tissues to assess the prognostic significance of these proteins. The expression of SOCS3 and A20 was initially detected by western blot in 22 cases of freshly frozen CCA tumors with corresponding peritumoral tissues and 22 control normal bile duct tissues. Then, these proteins were investigated in 86 CCA patients by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and were evaluated for their association with clinicopathological parameters in human CCA. The results indicated that SOCS3 expression was significantly lower in CCA tumor tissues than in corresponding peritumoral biliary tissues and normal bile duct tissues. Conversely, A20 was overexpressed in CCA tissues. Thus, an inverse correlation between the expression of SOCS3 and A20 was discovered. Furthermore, patients with low SOCS3 expression or high A20 expression showed a dramatically lower overall survival rate. These proteins were both associated with CCA lymph node metastasis, postoperative recurrence and overall survival rate. However, only A20 showed a significant association with the tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage, while SOCS3 showed a significant association with tumor differentiation. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that SOCS3 and A20 were independent prognostic indicators for overall survival in CCA. Thus, our study demonstrated that SOCS3 and A20 represent novel prognostic factors for human CCA.",

However, aberrant expression of BORIS is observed in various carcinomas, indicating a malignant role for this protein. Furthermore, abolishment or reduction of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) expression directed by promoter methylation is considered significant in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) carcinogenesis. This study aims to investigate BORIS and SOCS3 expression in HCC specimens and assess the prognostic significance of these proteins.BORIS and SOCS3 expression was examined using immunohistochemistry in HCC tissues, along with corresponding paracarcinomatous, cirrhosis, hepatitis, and normal liver tissues. The expression levels of these 2 proteins in HCC were evaluated for their association with clinicopathological parameters. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves, the log-rank test, and multivariate Cox regression analysis.BORIS expression was significantly higher in HCC tissues than in normal liver tissues. In contrast, SOCS3 expression was dramatically lower in HCC tissues. BORIS expression was associated with tumor size, differentiation grade, satellite lesions, and recurrence while SOCS3 expression correlated with differentiation grade, vascular invasion, and recurrence. A significant negative correlation between BORIS and SOCS3 was observed. Patients with high BORIS expression and/or low SOCS3 expression had poorer postoperative survival. Patients with both these characteristics had the poorest prognostic outcome.BORIS and SOCS3 are promising as valuable indicators for predicting HCC prognosis.",

      "# Title: Prognostic significance of SOCS3 and its biological function in colorectal cancer.\n# Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignant tumor, in which the inflammatory microenvironment plays an important role. STAT3 signaling pathway is regarded as the \"bridge\" between inflammation and cancer, and involved in the development of CRC. SOCS3 is a key negative feedback regulator of JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Studies about SOCS3 gene in CRC are rarely reported. The purpose of this study is to determine the expression of SOCS3 in CRC tissue and its correlation with the clinical pathological characteristics and prognosis of colorectal cancers. The effects of SOCS3 on biological behavior such as apoptosis, proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor formation in nude mice were studied. We observed that SOCS3 expression was down-regulated in CRC tissues, while IL-6, pSTAT3 were up-regulated. Inflammatory cytokines IL-6 can promote the expression of STAT3 signaling pathways while inhibit the expression of SOCS3 by promoting hypermethylation of SOCS3 gene promoters. 5-Aza-cdR treatment can reverse IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway mediated down-regulation of SOCS3 in colorectal cancer cells. Low expression of SOCS3 was correlated with lymph node metastasis and advanced clinical stage. Patients with high expression of SOCS3 in colorectal cancers often indicated a relatively good prognosis. Overexpression of SOCS3 inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion and tumorigenic ability of CRC cells while increased cell apoptosis. This study demonstrated that IL-6/STAT3 signaling activation negatively regulated SOCS3 expression, which led to imbalance and sustained activation of STAT3 signaling pathway. Reduced expression of SOCS3 promoted the growth and metastasis of colorectal cancer. Thus, targeting IL-6/STAT3/SOCS3 signaling pathway may become an important treatment strategy of colorectal cancer.",

Methods: We assessed the expression of PD-L1, CD276, SOCS3, CD4 and CD8 by immunohistochemistry in tumor tissue from 74 HCC patients who underwent curative hepatectomy. Results: High expression of PD-L1 was significantly associated with high Edmondson grade (p<0.01) and elevated enzyme (p=0.037); high expression of CD276 was significantly correlated with high Edmondson grade (p=0.021); high expression of SOCS3 was significantly associated with age (p=0.026) and tumor size (p=0.041), while PD-L1 showed no significant correlation. The expression of PD-L1, CD276, SOCS3 protein and other clinicopathological factors (sex, vascular invasion, tumor number, tumor capsule, pT stage, liver cirrhosis, HBsAg, TBiL, AFP) showed no significant correlation (p>0.05). High expression of CD8 was respectively significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS) (p=0.002). There was no significantly difference between CD4 and CD8 high-expression and overall survival (OS) (p=0.100). Both high expression of PD-L1 (p=0.003) and low expression of SOCS3 (p=0.015) was significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS). But CD276 only had a trendency (p=0.166). Additionally, multivariate Cox regression models implied that PD-L1, SOCS3, as well as both CD4 and CD8 was an independent prognostic factor for OS (p<0.05). Furthermore, HCC patients with PD-L1 low-expression and SOCS3 high-expression had a better prognostic according to the different pT stages (p<0.05). Conclusions: We for the first time demonstrated that PD-L1 and SOCS3 were independent prognostic factor for HCC patients. Co-expression of low PD-L1 and high SOCS3 could be a better predictive marker for HCC patients."

      "# Title: Prognostic significance of SOCS3 and its biological function in colorectal cancer.\n# Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignant tumor, in which the inflammatory microenvironment plays an important role. STAT3 signaling pathway is regarded as the \"bridge\" between inflammation and cancer, and involved in the development of CRC. SOCS3 is a key negative feedback regulator of JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Studies about SOCS3 gene in CRC are rarely reported. The purpose of this study is to determine the expression of SOCS3 in CRC tissue and its correlation with the clinical pathological characteristics and prognosis of colorectal cancers. The effects of SOCS3 on biological behavior such as apoptosis, proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor formation in nude mice were studied. We observed that SOCS3 expression was down-regulated in CRC tissues, while IL-6, pSTAT3 were up-regulated. Inflammatory cytokines IL-6 can promote the expression of STAT3 signaling pathways while inhibit the expression of SOCS3 by promoting hypermethylation of SOCS3 gene promoters. 5-Aza-cdR treatment can reverse IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway mediated down-regulation of SOCS3 in colorectal cancer cells. Low expression of SOCS3 was correlated with lymph node metastasis and advanced clinical stage. Patients with high expression of SOCS3 in colorectal cancers often indicated a relatively good prognosis. Overexpression of SOCS3 inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion and tumorigenic ability of CRC cells while increased cell apoptosis. This study demonstrated that IL-6/STAT3 signaling activation negatively regulated SOCS3 expression, which led to imbalance and sustained activation of STAT3 signaling pathway. Reduced expression of SOCS3 promoted the growth and metastasis of colorectal cancer. Thus, targeting IL-6/STAT3/SOCS3 signaling pathway may become an important treatment strategy of colorectal cancer.",

      "# Title: Correlation of PD-L1 and SOCS3 Co-expression with the Prognosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients.\n# Abstract: Purpose: To investigate the correlation between the expression of PD-L1, SOCS3 and immune-related biomarkers CD276, CD4, CD8 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and further determine the relationship with clinicopathologic characteristics and the prognostic value of their co-expression in HCC patients. Methods: We assessed the expression of PD-L1, CD276, SOCS3, CD4 and CD8 by immunohistochemistry in tumor tissue from 74 HCC patients who underwent curative hepatectomy. Results: High expression of PD-L1 was significantly associated with high Edmondson grade (p<0.01) and elevated enzyme (p=0.037); high expression of CD276 was significantly correlated with high Edmondson grade (p=0.021); high expression of SOCS3 was significantly associated with age (p=0.026) and tumor size (p=0.041), while PD-L1 showed no significant correlation. The expression of PD-L1, CD276, SOCS3 protein and other clinicopathological factors (sex, vascular invasion, tumor number, tumor capsule, pT stage, liver cirrhosis, HBsAg, TBiL, AFP) showed no significant correlation (p>0.05). High expression of CD8 was respectively significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS) (p=0.002). There was no significantly difference between CD4 and CD8 high-expression and overall survival (OS) (p=0.100). Both high expression of PD-L1 (p=0.003) and low expression of SOCS3 (p=0.015) was significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS). But CD276 only had a trendency (p=0.166). Additionally, multivariate Cox regression models implied that PD-L1, SOCS3, as well as both CD4 and CD8 was an independent prognostic factor for OS (p<0.05). Furthermore, HCC patients with PD-L1 low-expression and SOCS3 high-expression had a better prognostic according to the different pT stages (p<0.05). Conclusions: We for the first time demonstrated that PD-L1 and SOCS3 were independent prognostic factor for HCC patients. Co-expression of low PD-L1 and high SOCS3 could be a better predictive marker for HCC patients."

      "conclusionA": "Despite its initially perceived role as a tumor suppressor, evidence suggests **SOCS3 frequently functions as a pro-oncogenic factor in solid tumors, particularly through its impact on immune evasion and treatment resistance**, though this effect is highly context-dependent based on tumor type, genetic background, and treatment regimen; therefore, **publication bias likely exists, favoring the reporting of associations linking high SOCS3 expression to poor prognosis**, obscuring a complete understanding of its complex and nuanced role in cancer progression.",
      "conclusionB": "Loss of SOCS3 expression is significantly associated with poorer overall survival across multiple solid tumor types—including breast, gastric, cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocellular, and colorectal cancers—and, in some cases, predicts increased lymph node metastasis and tumor recurrence, functioning as an independent prognostic indicator alongside other established factors."

In this retrospective study we report on success rates with the over-the-scope clip (OTSC) system in upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding in this high-risk patient population. Patients and methods Between February 2011 and June 2014, 75 patients were treated with an OTSC for active gastrointestinal bleeding. Success rates with the first endoscopic therapy, rebleeding episodes, their management and the influence of antithrombotic or anticoagulant therapy were analyzed retrospectively. Results Application of the OTSC resulted in immediate hemostasis (primary success rate) in all 75 patients. However, in 34.7 % a rebleeding episode was noted that could be treated by further endoscopic interventions. Only 3 patients had to be sent to the operating room because of failure of endoscopic therapy. In the rebleeding group the use of antiplatelet therapies was higher (73.1 % vs. 48.9 %). Conclusions Application of the OTSC in GI bleeding results in a high rate of primary hemostasis. Rebleeding occurs in up to 35 % of patients receiving antithrombotic/anticoagulant therapy but can be managed successfully with further endoscopic treatments. Patients in the rebleeding group were more frequently treated with antiplatelet agents.

The over-the-scope clip (OTSC) may overcome limitations of standard clips or thermocoagulation in high-risk bleeding lesions. We evaluate the main clinically relevant outcomes following endoscopic hemostasis with OTSC in high-risk lesions and/or patients. Patients and methods  This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected databases including all patients with UGIB and LGIB who underwent OTCS placement as first-line treatment in eleven tertiary endoscopic referral centers. Technical success, primary hemostasis, rebleeding, blood transfusion, hospital stay, and hemorrhage-related mortality rates were evaluated. Results  Data from 286 patients, with either UGIB (N = 214) or LGIB (N = 72) were available. Overall, 112 patients (39.2 %) were receiving antithrombotic therapy. Technical success and primary hemostasis rates were 97.9 % and 96.4 %, respectively. Early rebleeding occurred in 4.4 %, more frequently in those on antithrombotic therapy, and no late rebleeding was observed. Following a successful primary haemostasis, only 5.2 % patients needed blood transfusions, and the median hospital stay was 4 days (range: 3 - 11). Eighteen patients with either technical failure (N = 6) or rebleeding (N = 12) underwent radiological or surgical approaches. Overall, bleeding-related deaths occurred in 5 (1.7 %) patients, including 3 patients with technical procedural failure, and 2 in the rebleeding group.  Conclusions  Data from our large, multicenter study show that OTSC placement is an effective first-line treatment for hemostasis in high-risk patients and/or lesions both in upper and lower gastrointestinal tract.",

Patients and methods  Data on endoscopic treatment (first- vs. second-line) in PUB with OTSC and clinical data were analyzed. The primary outcome was the clinical success of hemostasis, defined as the absence of recurrent bleeding or further intervention. Secondary outcomes were factors associated with OTSC failure. Results  From April 2014 to March 2018, 100 patients (age 72 [20 - 98] y, female 36 %) with PUB in the stomach or the duodenum were treated endoscopically with the OTSC. The OTSC was used as a first-line procedure (primary-OTSC) in 66 pts. Successful hemostasis could be achieved in 90.9 %. After failure of an initial endoscopic treatment, 34 patients were treated with the OTSC (secondary-OTSC) and the treatment was successful in 94.1 %. Recurrent bleeding occurred in n = 10 for primary-OTSC (16.7 %) and in n = 7 pts in the secondary-OTSC (21.9 %) ( P  = 0.81). Clinical success in the primary-OTSC was 75.8 % and 73.5 % in the secondary-OTSC respectively. Conclusions  The OTSC has a high rate of initial bleeding control in first- and second line treatment of PUB. OTSC failure occurs more often in the duodenum than in the stomach and results in longer intensive care unit stay, higher amount of transfusions, and a higher reimbursement per case."

A total of 80 patients with acute cerebral infarction who were treated at our hospital were randomly selected. They were divided into groups A and B. The two groups were treated with intravenous thrombolysis, while group B received sub-hypothermia treatment. Prior to treatment and at 7 days after treatment, 5 ml of venous blood was collected and stored in a freezer at -80˚C. IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 levels were detected by ELISA and compared between the groups and time-points. The results were as follows: i) At 7 days after treatment, the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in group B were significantly decreased compared with those in group A (P<0.05), while there was no significant difference of these levels between group A and B before treatment (P>0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions in group A and group B was 35 and 20% respectively, and the mortality rate was 10 and 5%, respectively. There were no significant differences in adverse events and mortality between the two groups (P>0.05). In addition, a positive correlation of the level of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was determined in the patients prior to treatment.

      "# Title: Prospective and randomized evaluation of ACL reconstruction with three techniques: a clinical and radiographic evaluation at 5 years follow-up.\n# Abstract: A variety of graft sources have been used for ACL reconstruction to improve functions and kinematics in ACL deficient knees. The two most commonly used autogenous grafts are the central third of the patellar tendon and the hamstring tendon constructs. The choice of different grafts and different construct influence the final clinical outcome of ACL reconstruction. The 3 groups, of 25 patients each, were generated by choosing the technique (PT tendon, 4 strand hamstring, and single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty) to utilize and followed for 5 years, with an alternate systematic sampling. Our comparison has shown significant kneeling pain in the patellar tendon with respect to the groups with hamstrings techniques. Single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty achieved subjective score significantly higher with respect to the other two groups as well as for the time to resume sport. The study confirms that patellar tendon and hamstring can be equivalent options for ACL reconstruction. This study demonstrated that a superior outcome as far as subjective clinical findings were concerned, was obtained in group III. Patients in the latter group were also able to return to sports sooner than those in the bone-patellar tendon graft group and the four-strand hamstring group.",

The purpose of this prospective randomized study was to compare the clinical, instrumental and X-ray outcome of two ACL reconstruction techniques with hamstring tendons: one with a single intra-articular bundle associated to an extra-articular sling, the second with a more anatomic double-bundle technique that reproduces better the native ACL function. From an initial group of 100 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction, 72 patients (35 single bundle plus lateral plasty and 37 double bundle) were evaluated with IKDC, Tegner score, KT2000 arthrometer, Activity Rating Scale, Psychovitality Questionnaire and Ahlback radiographic score at a mean 3 years follow-up. Double-bundle group showed significantly better results regarding IKDC, ROM, Activity Rating Scale and time to return to sport. Also KT 2000 showed significant differences in objective stability.

Proprioception was evaluated using joint position sense and dynamic postural stability. Patient-reported outcomes were measured using the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK-11) scores. Functional performance was assessed using single-leg hop distance (SLHD) and Limb Symmetry Index. In the operated knees, quadriceps (at 6 months postoperatively, p = 0.003) and hamstring (at 6 and 12 months postoperatively, p < 0.001) strength were significantly higher in the combined ACLR and ALLR group than the isolated ACLR group.

Our objective was to determine if mFI predicts morbidity and mortality in the diverse national cohort of patients undergoing neurosurgery for intracranial neoplasms. We identified patients in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program who underwent oncologic neurosurgery procedures between 2008 and 2012. The mFI, ranging from 0 to 1, was calculated as the proportion of 11 possible risk factors present. We assessed the associations between mFI and 30-day mortality, neurologic and medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge in univariate and multivariable analyses and compare the index to established risk stratification techniques. A total of 9149 patients were identified. Mortality, severe medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge increased incrementally with increasing levels of frailty. Severe neurologic complications were highest in those with low frailty. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, increased frailty increased the odds of all adverse outcomes, including neurologic complications. The mFI increased the ability to predict all outcomes beyond available indices and was the most reliable predictor of neurologic complications. The mFI can be calculated from routinely collected medical record data and is predictive of 30-day adverse outcomes in a wide variety of neurosurgical oncology patients. The index may be a useful component of preoperative risk assessment with implications for shared decision-making, perioperative planning, and risk adjusted outcomes measurement in national quality registries.",

Few data exist regarding the relationship of frailty with adverse outcomes in craniotomy for brain tumor resection. We assessed the relationship between frailty and the incidence of major post-operative complication, discharge destination other than home, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality after elective craniotomy for brain tumor resection. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 20,333 adult patients undergoing elective craniotomy for tumor resection in the 2012-2018 ACS-NSQIP Participant Use File. Multivariate logistic regression was performed using all covariates deemed eligible through clinical and statistical significance. 6,249 patients (30.7%) were low-frailty and 2,148 patients (10.6%) were medium-to-high frailty. In multivariate logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, BMI, ASA classification, smoking status, dyspnea, significant pre-operative weight loss, chronic steroid use, bleeding disorder, tumor type, and operative time, low frailty was associated with increased adjusted odds ratio of major complication (1.41, 95% CI: 1.23-1.60, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.32, 95% CI: 1.20-1.46, p < 0.001), 30-day readmission (1.29, 95% CI: 1.15-1.44, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (1.87, 95% CI: 1.41-2.47, p < 0.001). Moderate-to-high frailty was also associated with increased adjusted odds of major complication (1.61, 95% CI: 1.35-1.92, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.80, 95% CI: 1.58-2.05), 30-day readmission (1.39, 95% CI: 1.19-1.62, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (2.42, 95% CI: 1.74-3.38, p < 0.001).

      "# Title: Iron overload in cirrhosis-HFE genotypes and outcome after liver transplantation.\n# Abstract: Previously, we found appreciable hepatic iron deposition in one third of our patients undergoing liver transplantation (LTx) with approximately 10% of cases having quantifiable iron in the range of that seen in hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC). The aim of this study was to compare clinical outcome in liver transplant patients with and without iron overload. We also sought to determine the prevalence of HFE mutations in liver transplant patients with iron overload. Of 456 consecutive liver transplants, 41 explants had an hepatic iron index (HII) greater than 1.9, and these cases were compared to 41 matched liver transplant recipients without increased hepatic iron. Posttransplantation complications, along with patient and graft survival were monitored. HFE gene testing was performed using DNA-based techniques. Kaplan-Meier 5-year patient survival after LTx was significantly lower in cases with hepatic iron overload compared to matched controls without iron excess (48% vs. 77%; P =.045). Fatal infections (especially fungal) were more common in patients with iron overload (24% vs. 7%; P =.03). Of the 41 patients with a liver explant HII greater than 1.9, only 4 were C282Y homozygotes. Patients with severe hepatic explant iron overload undergoing LTx have a reduced survival compared to liver transplant recipients without explant iron excess. The reduced survival was attributable mainly to fatal bacterial and fungal infections. Despite the iron overload, HFE gene mutations were uncommon in patients with hepatic explant hemosiderosis.",
      "# Title: Association of hepatic iron overload with invasive fungal infection in liver transplant recipients.\n# Abstract: Invasive fungal infection is a serious complication of orthotopic liver transplantation, but its risk factors remain incompletely defined. Iron overload has already been associated with increased risk of fungal infections, but it has not yet been assessed as a risk factor in liver transplantation. We retrospectively studied a cohort of 153 consecutive patients who underwent their first liver transplantation at a single center and who survived at least 7 days after transplantation. The association between various pretransplant patient characteristics, including hepatic explant iron and risk of invasive fungal infections, was analyzed by univariate and multivariate models. Iron in the hepatic explant was assessed by Perl's Prussian blue stain by a pathologist blinded to clinical outcome. During the first year after transplantation, 28 of 153 patients developed a total of 31 invasive fungal infections, of which 21 (68%) were caused by Candida, 7 (23%) by Aspergillus, 2 (6%) by Cryptococcus, and 1 (3%) by Saccharomyces. Stainable iron in the hepatic explant was found in 48 patients (31%). Stainable iron in the hepatic explant was found to be strongly and independently associated with posttransplantation fungal infections in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 3.09; 95% confidence interval 1.45-6.56; P = 0.003). Hepatic iron overload is strongly and independently associated with posttransplantation invasive fungal infections. Studies to confirm this finding in other centers and define the mechanism are warranted.",
      "# Title: Serum ferritin concentration predicts mortality in patients awaiting liver transplantation.\n# Abstract: Additional markers are required to identify patients on the orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) waiting list at increased risk of death and adverse clinical events. Serum ferritin concentration is a marker of varied pathophysiological events and is elevated with increased liver iron concentration, hepatic necroinflammation, and systemic illness, all of which may cause a deterioration in liver function and clinical status. The aim of this study was to determine whether serum ferritin concentration is an independent prognostic factor in subjects awaiting OLT. This is a dual-center retrospective study. The study cohort consisted of 191 consecutive adults with cirrhosis accepted by the Queensland (Australia) Liver Transplant Service between January 2000 and June 2006 and a validation cohort of 131 patients from University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Transplant Center. In the study cohort, baseline serum ferritin greater than 200 microg/L was an independent factor predicting increased 180-day and 1-year waiting list mortality. This effect was independent of model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), hepatocellular carcinoma, age, and sex. Subjects with higher serum ferritin had increased frequency of liver-related clinical events. The relationship between serum ferritin and waiting list mortality was confirmed in the UCLA cohort; all deceased patients had serum ferritin greater than 400 microg/L. Serum ferritin greater than 500 microg/L and MELD were independent risk factors for death.",

      "# Title: Serum ferritin concentration and transferrin saturation before liver transplantation predict decreased long-term recipient survival.\n# Abstract: Serum ferritin (SF) concentration is a widely available parameter used to assess iron homeostasis. It has been described as a marker to identify high-risk patients awaiting liver transplantation (LT) but is also elevated in systemic immune-mediated diseases, metabolic syndrome, and in hemodialysis where it is associated with an inferior prognosis. This study analyzed whether SF is not only a predictor of liver-related mortality prior to LT but also an independent marker of survival following LT. In a dual-center, retrospective study, a cohort of 328 consecutive first-LT patients from Hannover Medical School, Germany (2003-2008, follow-up 1260 days), and 82 consecutive LT patients from Regensburg University Hospital, Germany (2003-2007, follow-up 1355 days) as validation cohort were analyzed. In patients exhibiting SF ≥365 μg/L versus <365 μg/L prior to LT, 1-, 3-, and 5-year post-LT survival was 73.3% versus 81.1%, 64.4% versus 77.3%, and 61.1% versus 74.4%, respectively (overall survival P = 0.0097), which was confirmed in the validation cohort (overall survival of 55% versus 83.3%, P = 0.005). Multivariate analyses identified SF ≥365 μg/L combined with transferrin saturation (TFS) <55%, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the survival after LT (SALT) score as independent risk factors for death. In patients with SF concentrations ≥365 μg/L and TFS <55%, overall survival was 54% versus 74.8% in the remaining group (P = 0.003). In the validation cohort, it was 28.6% versus 72% (P = 0.017), respectively.",
      "# Title: The association of pretransplant ferritin level with waiting list and post-transplant survival. Does ferritin actually predict outcome?\n# Abstract: Recent data suggest an association of serum ferritin (SF) with waiting list (WL) and postliver transplant (LT) outcomes. To assess the predictive capacity of SF on pre- and post-LT outcomes, and to identify whether recipient or donor liver siderosis is associated with post-LT survival; a retrospective analysis of 1079 patients assessed for first LT, 2000-2007 was performed. Iron deposition in the liver tissue was assessed using a semi-quantitative grading system. Median age was 54 (18-82) years and 67% were male. Seventeen per cent had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Median Model for End-stage Liver Disease MELD score was 14 (6-40), ferritin was 174 μg/l (4-4597) with 36.5% had a SF ≥ μg/l. Age (OR = 1.028) and MELD score (OR = 1.158) were independently associated with WL mortality (P < 0.001), whilst SF was not (P = NS). Age (OR = 1.018), HCC (OR = 1.542) and cold ischemia time (CIT) ≥ 10 h (OR = 1.418) were independently associated with post-LT survival (P < 0.05). Explant siderosis grade <2 was seen in 376 (71.7%) patients. Patients with explant siderosis grade ≥ 2 had inferior 12-month post-LT survival (P = 0.030). Presence of graft siderosis (15.8% of patients) was not associated with survival. In conclusion, we found a limited role for SF as a prognostic indicator for pre- or post-transplant survival.",
      "# Title: Iron-related markers are associated with infection after liver transplantation.\n# Abstract: Though serum iron has been known to be associated with an increased risk of infection, hepcidin, the major regulator of iron metabolism, has never been systematically explored in this setting. Finding early biomarkers of infection, such as hepcidin, could help identify patients in whom early empiric antimicrobial therapy would be beneficial. We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients (n = 128) undergoing first-time, single-organ orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) without known iron overload disorders at 2 academic hospitals in Boston from August 2009 to November 2012. Cox regression compared the associations between different iron markers and the development of first infection at least 1 week after OLT; 47 (37%) patients developed a primary outcome of infection at least 1 week after OLT and 1 patient died. After adjusting for perioperative bleeding complications, number of hospital days, and hepatic artery thrombosis, changes in iron markers were associated with the development of infection post-OLT including increasing ferritin (hazard ratio [HR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-2.05), rising ferritin slope (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.17), and increasing hepcidin (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.05-1.93). A decreasing iron (HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.20-2.57) and a decreasing iron slope (HR, 4.21; 95% CI, 2.51-7.06) were also associated with subsequent infections. In conclusion, hepcidin and other serum iron markers and their slope patterns or their combination are associated with infection in vulnerable patient populations.

      "# Title: Iron metabolism imbalance at the time of listing increases overall and infectious mortality after liver transplantation.\n# Abstract: Liver transplantation (LT) is the best treatment for patients with liver cancer or end stage cirrhosis, but it is still associated with a significant mortality. Therefore identifying factors associated with mortality could help improve patient management. The impact of iron metabolism, which could be a relevant therapeutic target, yield discrepant results in this setting. Previous studies suggest that increased serum ferritin is associated with higher mortality. Surprisingly iron deficiency which is a well described risk factor in critically ill patients has not been considered."

This single-center study was conducted to assess the accuracy of SWE in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), in comparison with transient elastography (TE), by using liver biopsy (LB) as the reference standard. Consecutive patients with CHC scheduled for LB by referring physicians were studied. One hundred and twenty-one patients met inclusion criteria. On the same day, real-time SWE using the ultrasound (US) system, Aixplorer (SuperSonic Imagine S.A., Aix-en-Provence, France), TE using FibroScan (Echosens, Paris, France), and US-assisted LB were consecutively performed. Fibrosis was staged according to the METAVIR scoring system. Analyses of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were performed to calculate optimal area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for F0-F1 versus F2-F4, F0- F2 versus F3-F4, and F0-F3 versus F4 for both real-time SWE and TE. Liver stiffness values increased in parallel with degree of liver fibrosis, both with SWE and TE. AUROCs were 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-0.96) for SWE and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.76-0.90) for TE (P = 0.002), 0.98 (95% CI: 0.94-1.00) for SWE and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.90-0.99) for TE (P = 0.14), and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.93-1.00) for SWE and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.91-0.99) for TE (P = 0.48), when comparing F0-F1 versus F2- F4, F0- F2 versus F3-F4, and F0 -F3 versus F4, respectively.",

Intra- and inter-operator reliability and repeatability were quantified in three different liver segments in a sample of 15 subjects, scanned during four independent sessions (two scans on day 1, two scans 1 wk later) by two operators. A total of 1440 measurements were made. Reproducibility was assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and a repeated measures analysis of variance. The shear wave speed was measured and used to estimate Young's modulus using the Supersonics Imagine Aixplorer. The median Young's modulus measured through the inter-costal space was 5.55 ± 0.74 kPa. The intra-operator reliability was better for same-day evaluations (ICC = 0.91) than the inter-operator reliability (ICC = 0.78). Intra-observer agreement decreased when scans were repeated on a different day. Inter-session repeatability was between 3.3% and 9.9% for intra-day repeated scans, compared with to 6.5%-12% for inter-day repeated scans.

The rate of reliable liver stiffness measurements was significantly higher with 2-D SWE than with TE: 99.2% versus 74.8%, p < 0.0001 (different reliability criteria used, according to current recommendations). In univariate analysis, liver stiffness measured with 2-D SWE correlated best with fibrosis stage estimated with TE (r = 0.699, p < 0.0001), followed by Forns score (r = 0.534, p < 0.0001) and King's score (r = 0.512, p < 0.0001). However, in multivariate analysis, only 2-D SWE-measured values remained correlated with fibrosis stage (p < 0.0001). The optimal 2-D SWE cutoff values for predicting significant fibrosis were 8.03 kPa for fibrosis stage ≥2 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.832) and 13.1 kPa for fibrosis stage 4 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.915), respectively.

      "# Title: Assessment of liver fibrosis with 2-D shear wave elastography in comparison to transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse imaging in patients with chronic liver disease.\n# Abstract: Two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2-D SWE) is an ultrasound-based elastography method integrated into a conventional ultrasound machine. It can evaluate larger regions of interest and, therefore, might be better at determining the overall fibrosis distribution. The aim of this prospective study was to compare 2-D SWE with the two best evaluated liver elastography methods, transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse (point SWE using acoustic radiation force impulse) imaging, in the same population group. The study included 132 patients with chronic hepatopathies, in which liver stiffness was evaluated using transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging and 2-D SWE. The reference methods were liver biopsy for the assessment of liver fibrosis (n = 101) and magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography for the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis (n = 31). No significant difference in diagnostic accuracy, assessed as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), was found between the three elastography methods (2-D SWE, transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging) for the diagnosis of significant and advanced fibrosis and liver cirrhosis in the \"per protocol\" (AUROCs for fibrosis stages ≥2: 0.90, 0.95 and 0.91; for fibrosis stage [F] ≥3: 0.93, 0.95 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.92, 0.96 and 0.92) and \"intention to diagnose\" cohort (AUROCs for F ≥2: 0.87, 0.92 and 0.91; for F ≥3: 0.91, 0.93 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.88, 0.90 and 0.89).

The goal of this study was to assess the clinical use of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) evaluated by supersonic shear imaging (SSI), FibroScan, and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) in a cohort of NAFLD patients who underwent liver biopsy. A total of 291 NAFLD patients were prospectively enrolled from November 2011 to February 2015 at 2 French university hospitals. LSM was assessed by SSI, FibroScan (M probe), and ARFI within two weeks prior to liver biopsy. Calculations of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) were performed and compared for the staging of liver fibrosis. AUROC for SSI, FibroScan, and ARFI were 0.86, 0.82, and 0.77 for diagnoses of ≥F2; 0.89, 0.86, and 0.84 for ≥F3; and 0.88, 0.87, and 0.84 for F4, respectively. SSI had a higher accuracy than ARFI for diagnoses of significant fibrosis (≥F2) (P = 0.004). Clinical factors related to obesity such as body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2) , waist circumference ≥102 cm or increased parietal wall thickness were associated with LSM failures when using SSI or FibroScan and with unreliable results when using ARFI. In univariate analysis, FibroScan values were slightly correlated with NAFLD activity score and steatosis (R = 0.28 and 0.22, respectively), whereas SSI and ARFI were not; however, these components of NAFLD did not affect LSM results in multivariate analysis. The cutoff values for SSI and FibroScan for staging fibrosis with a sensitivity ≥90% were very close: 6.3/6.2 kPa for ≥F2, 8.3/8.2 kPa for ≥F3, and 10.5/9.5 kPa for F4.",

Our prospective study included 115 consecutive patients with suspected or alleged chronic hepatitis. Patients underwent SWE by two different operators and TE by sonographers on the same day. The correlation coefficient of the intra-class correlation test between an experienced radiologist and a third-year radiology resident was 0.878. There was a moderate correlation between SWE and TE (r = 0.511) in the diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis. The best cutoff values predicting significant hepatic fibrosis and liver cirrhosis by SWE were >1.78 m/s (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] = 0.777) and >2.24 m/s (AUROC = 0.935), respectively.

      "# Title: Comparison of 2-D Shear Wave Elastography and Transient Elastography for Assessing Liver Fibrosis in Chronic Hepatitis B.\n# Abstract: This study compared 2-D shear wave elastography (SWE) and transient elastography (TE) for liver fibrosis staging in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection using liver biopsy as the reference standard. Patients with CHB infection who underwent liver biopsy were consecutively included. After exclusions, 257 patients were analyzed. Two-dimensional SWE resulted in a significantly higher rate of reliable measurements (98.1%, 252/257) than TE (93.0%, 239/257) (p = 0.011). Liver stiffness measurements of the two examinations exhibited a strong correlation (r = 0.835, p < 0.001). In patients given a confirmed histologic diagnosis, Spearman's rank coefficients were 0.520 in stage F0 (p < 0.001), 0.684 in stage F1 (p < 0.001), 0.777 in stage F2 (p < 0.001), 0.672 in stage F3 (p < 0.001) and 0.755 in stage F4 (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of 2-D SWE and TE for liver fibrosis staging (all p values > 0.05). Two-dimensional SWE had diagnostic accuracy comparable to that of TE for liver fibrosis staging. The measurements that the two techniques provide are not interchangeable.",

The purpose of this study was to perform an intra-individual comparison between 2-D shear wave elastography (2-D-SWE with a GE system) and Virtual Touch Tissue Quantification (VTTQ with a Siemens system) to assess whether these can be used interchangeably to grade fibrosis. Ninety-three patients (51 men, 42 women; mean age, 54 y) with liver disease of various etiologies (hepatitis B virus = 47, hepatitis C virus = 22; alcohol = 6, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis = 5, other = 13) were included. Using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values, liver fibrosis was classified into clinically non-significant (F0/F1) and significant (≥F2) fibrosis. Results indicated that intra-modality repeatability was excellent for both techniques (GE 2-D-SWE: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.89 [0.84-0.93]; VTTQ: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.90 [0.86-0.93]). Intra-modality classification agreement for fibrosis grading was good to excellent (GE 2-D-SWE: κ = 0.65, VTTQ: κ = 0.82). However, inter-modality agreement for fibrosis grading was only fair (κ = 0.31) using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values of fibrosis. In conclusion, although both GE 2-D-SWE and Siemens VTTQ exhibit good to excellent intra-modality repeatability, inter-modality agreement is only fair, suggesting that these should not be used interchangeably.",

We show that, beyond the first 30 d after infection, individuals with COVID-19 are at increased risk of incident cardiovascular disease spanning several categories, including cerebrovascular disorders, dysrhythmias, ischemic and non-ischemic heart disease, pericarditis, myocarditis, heart failure and thromboembolic disease. These risks and burdens were evident even among individuals who were not hospitalized during the acute phase of the infection and increased in a graded fashion according to the care setting during the acute phase (non-hospitalized, hospitalized and admitted to intensive care).

We undertook a retrospective matched cohort study using a UK-based primary care database, Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum, to determine symptoms that are associated with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection beyond 12 weeks in non-hospitalized adults and the risk factors associated with developing persistent symptoms. We selected 486,149 adults with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 1,944,580 propensity score-matched adults with no recorded evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Outcomes included 115 individual symptoms, as well as long COVID, defined as a composite outcome of 33 symptoms by the World Health Organization clinical case definition. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for the outcomes. A total of 62 symptoms were significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection after 12 weeks. The largest aHRs were for anosmia (aHR 6.49, 95% CI 5.02-8.39), hair loss (3.99, 3.63-4.39), sneezing (2.77, 1.40-5.50), ejaculation difficulty (2.63, 1.61-4.28) and reduced libido (2.36, 1.61-3.47). Among the cohort of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, risk factors for long COVID included female sex, belonging to an ethnic minority, socioeconomic deprivation, smoking, obesity and a wide range of comorbidities. The risk of developing long COVID was also found to be increased along a gradient of decreasing age. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a plethora of symptoms that are associated with a range of sociodemographic and clinical risk factors."

Our study evaluates the safety of appendectomy performed with SDD in pediatric patients when compared to appendectomy followed by an overnight stay, using a large nationwide database and a strict definition of SDD by using hospital length of stay (LOS). Methods: Using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric (NSQIP-P) registry, we identified patients younger than 18 years of age who underwent outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy, with SDD (n = 2647) or overnight stay (n = 5045). One-to-one propensity score matching was performed to compare 30-day readmission rates and postsurgical complications. Results: Non-Hispanic black race was associated with a higher likelihood of overnight stay after laparoscopic appendectomy. In the propensity score-matched analysis (N = 2443 pairs), SDD was not associated with an increased risk of 30-day unplanned readmission (odds ratio [OR] = 0.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.6-1.4; P = .667) or any 30-day complication (OR = 0.8, 95% CI: 0.6-1.1; P = .258). Conclusion: SDD after laparoscopic appendectomy in pediatric patients was not associated with an increased risk of 30-day hospital admission or complication rate.

      "# Title: Use of over-the-scope clips (OTSC) for hemostasis in gastrointestinal bleeding in patients under antithrombotic therapy.\n# Abstract: Background and study aims In patients taking different regimens of antithrombotic and/or anticoagulant therapy, endoscopic management of gastrointestinal bleeding represents a major challenge due to failing endogenous hemostasis. In this retrospective study we report on success rates with the over-the-scope clip (OTSC) system in upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding in this high-risk patient population. Patients and methods Between February 2011 and June 2014, 75 patients were treated with an OTSC for active gastrointestinal bleeding. Success rates with the first endoscopic therapy, rebleeding episodes, their management and the influence of antithrombotic or anticoagulant therapy were analyzed retrospectively. Results Application of the OTSC resulted in immediate hemostasis (primary success rate) in all 75 patients. However, in 34.7 % a rebleeding episode was noted that could be treated by further endoscopic interventions. Only 3 patients had to be sent to the operating room because of failure of endoscopic therapy. In the rebleeding group the use of antiplatelet therapies was higher (73.1 % vs. 48.9 %). Conclusions Application of the OTSC in GI bleeding results in a high rate of primary hemostasis. Rebleeding occurs in up to 35 % of patients receiving antithrombotic/anticoagulant therapy but can be managed successfully with further endoscopic treatments. Patients in the rebleeding group were more frequently treated with antiplatelet agents. Radiological or surgical therapy was reserved for a small subgroup not successfully managed by repeated endoscopic therapies.

The over-the-scope clip (OTSC) may overcome limitations of standard clips or thermocoagulation in high-risk bleeding lesions. We evaluate the main clinically relevant outcomes following endoscopic hemostasis with OTSC in high-risk lesions and/or patients. Patients and methods  This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected databases including all patients with UGIB and LGIB who underwent OTCS placement as first-line treatment in eleven tertiary endoscopic referral centers. Technical success, primary hemostasis, rebleeding, blood transfusion, hospital stay, and hemorrhage-related mortality rates were evaluated. Results  Data from 286 patients, with either UGIB (N = 214) or LGIB (N = 72) were available. Overall, 112 patients (39.2 %) were receiving antithrombotic therapy. Technical success and primary hemostasis rates were 97.9 % and 96.4 %, respectively. Early rebleeding occurred in 4.4 %, more frequently in those on antithrombotic therapy, and no late rebleeding was observed. Following a successful primary haemostasis, only 5.2 % patients needed blood transfusions, and the median hospital stay was 4 days (range: 3 - 11). Eighteen patients with either technical failure (N = 6) or rebleeding (N = 12) underwent radiological or surgical approaches. Overall, bleeding-related deaths occurred in 5 (1.7 %) patients, including 3 patients with technical procedural failure, and 2 in the rebleeding group.  Conclusions  Data from our large, multicenter study show that OTSC placement is an effective first-line treatment for hemostasis in high-risk patients and/or lesions both in upper and lower gastrointestinal tract.",
      "# Title: Over-the-scope clip in peptic ulcer bleeding: clinical success in primary and secondary treatment and factors associated with treatment failure.\n# Abstract: Background and study aims  It is unclear if the clinical success rate of the over-the-scope-clip (OTSC) in peptic ulcer bleeding (PUB) is comparable when it is used in the first- or in the second-line of treatment. Patients and methods  Data on endoscopic treatment (first- vs. second-line) in PUB with OTSC and clinical data were analyzed. The primary outcome was the clinical success of hemostasis, defined as the absence of recurrent bleeding or further intervention. Secondary outcomes were factors associated with OTSC failure. Results  From April 2014 to March 2018, 100 patients (age 72 [20 - 98] y, female 36 %) with PUB in the stomach or the duodenum were treated endoscopically with the OTSC. The OTSC was used as a first-line procedure (primary-OTSC) in 66 pts. Successful hemostasis could be achieved in 90.9 %. After failure of an initial endoscopic treatment, 34 patients were treated with the OTSC (secondary-OTSC) and the treatment was successful in 94.1 %. Recurrent bleeding occurred in n = 10 for primary-OTSC (16.7 %) and in n = 7 pts in the secondary-OTSC (21.9 %) ( P  = 0.81). Clinical success in the primary-OTSC was 75.8 % and 73.5 % in the secondary-OTSC respectively. Conclusions  The OTSC has a high rate of initial bleeding control in first- and second line treatment of PUB. OTSC failure occurs more often in the duodenum than in the stomach and results in longer intensive care unit stay, higher amount of transfusions, and a higher reimbursement per case."

      "# Title: Lymph node metastasis is mediated by suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 in gastric cancer.\n# Abstract: Suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3), a multifunctional cytokine, is able to inhibit cell growth and migration by blocking the Janus kinase signal transducers and activators of transcription signaling (JAK/STAT) activation in oncogenesis. Although the STAT-3 expression was associated with lymph node metastasis from gastric cancer (GC), the implication of SOCS-3 expression in GC is not clearly elucidated. In this study, SOCS-3, STAT-3, and pSTAT-3 were evaluated in GC tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues of 107 patients who underwent curative surgery by immunohistochemistry. Further, SOCS-3 and STAT-3 mRNA levels were also detected simultaneously. In addition, survival analysis was performed between clinicopathologic variables and prognosis of GC patients. Finally, correlative analysis was adopted for demonstration the best predicator of the survival independent factor. From the results, we demonstrated that only the lymph node metastasis was the independent predictor of the overall survival (OS) of GC patients, although SOCS-3, STAT-3, and other variables were significantly relative to OS. With multivariate logistical regression analysis, SOCS-3, STAT-3, and the status of extragastric nodal metastasis were identified to be the independent factors of the lymph node metastasis from GC. Ultimately, the SOCS-3 was the best predicator of lymph node metastasis from GC identified with the nominal regression analysis. Therefore, SOCS-3 should be considered as a potential indicator for prediction the lymph node metastasis from GC.",

Although tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3, also known as A20) can decrease SOCS3 expression and is involved in the regulation of tumorigenesis in certain malignancies, its role in CCA remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression of SOCS3 and A20 in human CCA tissues to assess the prognostic significance of these proteins. The expression of SOCS3 and A20 was initially detected by western blot in 22 cases of freshly frozen CCA tumors with corresponding peritumoral tissues and 22 control normal bile duct tissues. Then, these proteins were investigated in 86 CCA patients by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and were evaluated for their association with clinicopathological parameters in human CCA. The results indicated that SOCS3 expression was significantly lower in CCA tumor tissues than in corresponding peritumoral biliary tissues and normal bile duct tissues. Conversely, A20 was overexpressed in CCA tissues. Thus, an inverse correlation between the expression of SOCS3 and A20 was discovered. Furthermore, patients with low SOCS3 expression or high A20 expression showed a dramatically lower overall survival rate. These proteins were both associated with CCA lymph node metastasis, postoperative recurrence and overall survival rate. However, only A20 showed a significant association with the tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage, while SOCS3 showed a significant association with tumor differentiation. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that SOCS3 and A20 were independent prognostic indicators for overall survival in CCA. Thus, our study demonstrated that SOCS3 and A20 represent novel prognostic factors for human CCA.",

However, aberrant expression of BORIS is observed in various carcinomas, indicating a malignant role for this protein. Furthermore, abolishment or reduction of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) expression directed by promoter methylation is considered significant in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) carcinogenesis. This study aims to investigate BORIS and SOCS3 expression in HCC specimens and assess the prognostic significance of these proteins.BORIS and SOCS3 expression was examined using immunohistochemistry in HCC tissues, along with corresponding paracarcinomatous, cirrhosis, hepatitis, and normal liver tissues. The expression levels of these 2 proteins in HCC were evaluated for their association with clinicopathological parameters. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves, the log-rank test, and multivariate Cox regression analysis.BORIS expression was significantly higher in HCC tissues than in normal liver tissues. In contrast, SOCS3 expression was dramatically lower in HCC tissues. BORIS expression was associated with tumor size, differentiation grade, satellite lesions, and recurrence while SOCS3 expression correlated with differentiation grade, vascular invasion, and recurrence. A significant negative correlation between BORIS and SOCS3 was observed. Patients with high BORIS expression and/or low SOCS3 expression had poorer postoperative survival. Patients with both these characteristics had the poorest prognostic outcome.BORIS and SOCS3 are promising as valuable indicators for predicting HCC prognosis.",

STAT3 signaling pathway is regarded as the \"bridge\" between inflammation and cancer, and involved in the development of CRC. SOCS3 is a key negative feedback regulator of JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Studies about SOCS3 gene in CRC are rarely reported. The purpose of this study is to determine the expression of SOCS3 in CRC tissue and its correlation with the clinical pathological characteristics and prognosis of colorectal cancers. The effects of SOCS3 on biological behavior such as apoptosis, proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor formation in nude mice were studied. We observed that SOCS3 expression was down-regulated in CRC tissues, while IL-6, pSTAT3 were up-regulated. Inflammatory cytokines IL-6 can promote the expression of STAT3 signaling pathways while inhibit the expression of SOCS3 by promoting hypermethylation of SOCS3 gene promoters. 5-Aza-cdR treatment can reverse IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway mediated down-regulation of SOCS3 in colorectal cancer cells. Low expression of SOCS3 was correlated with lymph node metastasis and advanced clinical stage. Patients with high expression of SOCS3 in colorectal cancers often indicated a relatively good prognosis. Overexpression of SOCS3 inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion and tumorigenic ability of CRC cells while increased cell apoptosis. This study demonstrated that IL-6/STAT3 signaling activation negatively regulated SOCS3 expression, which led to imbalance and sustained activation of STAT3 signaling pathway. Reduced expression of SOCS3 promoted the growth and metastasis of colorectal cancer. Thus, targeting IL-6/STAT3/SOCS3 signaling pathway may become an important treatment strategy of colorectal cancer.",

Methods: We assessed the expression of PD-L1, CD276, SOCS3, CD4 and CD8 by immunohistochemistry in tumor tissue from 74 HCC patients who underwent curative hepatectomy. Results: High expression of PD-L1 was significantly associated with high Edmondson grade (p<0.01) and elevated enzyme (p=0.037); high expression of CD276 was significantly correlated with high Edmondson grade (p=0.021); high expression of SOCS3 was significantly associated with age (p=0.026) and tumor size (p=0.041), while PD-L1 showed no significant correlation. The expression of PD-L1, CD276, SOCS3 protein and other clinicopathological factors (sex, vascular invasion, tumor number, tumor capsule, pT stage, liver cirrhosis, HBsAg, TBiL, AFP) showed no significant correlation (p>0.05). High expression of CD8 was respectively significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS) (p=0.002). There was no significantly difference between CD4 and CD8 high-expression and overall survival (OS) (p=0.100). Both high expression of PD-L1 (p=0.003) and low expression of SOCS3 (p=0.015) was significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS). But CD276 only had a trendency (p=0.166). Additionally, multivariate Cox regression models implied that PD-L1, SOCS3, as well as both CD4 and CD8 was an independent prognostic factor for OS (p<0.05). Furthermore, HCC patients with PD-L1 low-expression and SOCS3 high-expression had a better prognostic according to the different pT stages (p<0.05). Conclusions: We for the first time demonstrated that PD-L1 and SOCS3 were independent prognostic factor for HCC patients. Co-expression of low PD-L1 and high SOCS3 could be a better predictive marker for HCC patients."

In order to eliminate these confounding effects, this prospective comparative study studied a population of menopausal recipients with and without endometriosis sharing sibling oocytes coming from the same donor. The aim was to understand the impact of endometriosis on implantation, pregnancy and live birth rates in menopausal recipients. A total of 240 menopausal recipients of donated sibling oocytes, were divided in two groups. Group I consisted of 120 recipients diagnosed with endometriosis and group II consisted of 120 controls. The implantation and pregnancy rates were significantly lower in the endometriosis group compared with the control group (23.81% versus 31.48%, P=0.019; 45.00% versus 58.33%, P=0.039, respectively). In oocyte donation cycles, a recipient's history of endometriosis might have a negative impact on implantation, pregnancy and live birth rates, even in menopausal women. Infertility in endometriosis may be due to poor oocyte quality or embryos with decreased ability to implant due to impaired fertilization. There are no conclusive data on the impact of endometriosis on implantation. The already-known adverse effect of endometriosis on gamete quality makes it more difficult to demonstrate a direct effect of endometriosis on implantation. In order to eliminate these confounding effects we studied a population of menopausal recipients with and without endometriosis sharing sibling oocytes coming from the same oocyte donor. The oocyte donation model was used in an attempt to understand whether the endometrium, the oocytes or both are affected by endometriosis. The aim of the present study was to understand the impact of endometriosis on implantation, pregnancy and live birth rates in menopausal recipients. A total of 240 menopausal recipients of donated sibling oocytes were divided into two groups. Group I consisted of 120 recipients diagnosed with endometriosis and group II consisted of 120 controls. The pregnancy and implantation rates were significantly lower in the endometriosis group compared to the control group (45.00% versus 58.33%, P=0.039) and (23.81% versus 31.48%, P=0.019) respectively.

      "conclusionA": "While oocyte donation bypasses egg quality issues, adjunct therapies – particularly pre-transfer suppression of endometriosis with GnRH agonists/antagonists and, potentially, immunomodulation with IVIG – can improve live birth rates in women with endometriosis undergoing IVF, though evidence remains heterogeneous and optimal protocols require further research to personalize treatment based on disease severity and individual patient characteristics.",
      "conclusionB": "In menopausal recipients of sibling oocyte donation, a history of endometriosis is associated with significantly lower implantation (23.81% vs. 31.48%, P=0.019) and pregnancy rates (45.00% vs. 58.33%, P=0.039) compared to controls without endometriosis, suggesting endometriosis may negatively impact outcomes even when oocyte quality is controlled for.\n\n\n\n"

We examined WFA+ -M2BP levels in patients with F4 (cirrhosis), F3 or more (advanced fibrosis) and F2 or more (significant fibrosis) in the two groups. We further examined the relationship between five fibrosis markers and the degree of fibrosis. The WFA+ -M2BP values ranged from 0.25 cut-off index (COI) to 12.9 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 0.34-20.0 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P<.0001). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F4 in the two groups were 2.83 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 5.03 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P=.0046). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F3 or more in the two groups were 1.79 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 3.79 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P<.0001).

Consecutive adult NAFLD patients who had a liver biopsy were included. Serum WFA+-M2BP level was measured using a lectin-antibody sandwich immunoassay using a chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay machine (HISCL-5000, Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). The measured levels were indexed using the following equation: Cut-off index (COI) = ([WFA+-M2BP]sample-[WFA+-M2BP]NC) / ([WFA+-M2BP]PC-[WFA+-M2BP]NC), where PC = positive control and NC = negative control. Histopathological examination of liver biopsy specimen was reported according to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Clinical Research Network Scoring System. Data for 220 cases were analyzed. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of NASH was 0.65. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of steatosis grade ≥2 and 3 was 0.64 and 0.53, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of lobular inflammation grade ≥1, ≥2 and 3 was 0.57, 0.68 and 0.59, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of hepatocyte ballooning grade ≥1 and 2 was 0.64 and 0.65, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of fibrosis stage ≥1, ≥2, ≥3 and 4 was 0.61, 0.71, 0.74 and 0.84, respectively. Out of the 220 cases, 152 cases were the same 76 patients who had a repeat liver biopsy after 48 weeks of intervention. The AUROC of the change in the COI to detect improvement in steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning and fibrosis was 0.57, 0.54, 0.59 and 0.52, respectively. In conclusion, serum WFA+-M2BP was most useful for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in NAFLD patients. However, it was less useful for differentiating NASH from non-NASH, and for diagnosis and follow-up of the individual histopathological components of NASH.",
      "# Title: Serum Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2-binding protein expression predicts disease severity in chronic hepatitis C patients.\n# Abstract: Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein (WFA+-M2BP) has recently been developed as a promising liver fibrosis glyco biomarker. We assessed its efficacy in evaluating liver disease severity in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in Taiwan. The association between WFA+-M2BP and histological features was evaluated among those CHC patients underwent liver biopsy. We also aimed to clarify the factors determining the performance of WFA+-M2BP in CHC. A total of 229 CHC patients were consecutively recruited. The mean value of WFA+-M2BP in patients from F0 to F4 was 1.68, 2.23, 3.45, 3.48, 3.77 respectively (linear trend P = 0.008). Linear regression analysis revealed that alanine aminotransferase (odds ratio [OR]: 0.03, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.02-0.05, P < 0.001), AST (OR: -0.1, 95% CI: -0.02 to -0.01, P < 0.001), and liver fibrosis (OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.01-0.59, P = 0.043) were the independent factors correlated to serum WFA+-M2BP level. The optimal cutoff values of WFA+-M2BP for fibrosis stages F1, F2, F3, and F4 were 1.42, 1.61, 1.42, and 2.67, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the platelet count (OR/CI: -0.009/0.986-0.996, P = <0.001), r-glutamyl transferase (OR/CI: 0.007/1.000-1.013, P = 0.036), and WFA+-M2BP (OR/CI: 0.187/1.057-1.374, P = 0.005).

      "# Title: Comparison of serum fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B.\n# Abstract: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The diagnosis of liver fibrosis has a key role in selecting patients with CHB for antiviral treatment. However, serum biomarkers demonstrate limited diagnostic utility. The present study aimed to compare the performances of fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB and to identify the most appropriate biomarker for these patients. The current study included 96 antiviral-naïve patients with CHB who underwent liver biopsy. METAVIR scoring system was used to assess liver fibrosis and necroinflammation. The diagnostic performances were evaluated of the platelet (PLT) count; the levels of hyaluronan, serum 7S domain of type 4 collagen, procollagen type III N-terminal peptide, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1, Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) and N-terminal type III collagen propeptide (Pro-C3); the fibrosis index based on four factors; the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index; and enhanced liver fibrosis score for identifying significant liver fibrosis [≥fibrosis stage 2 (F2)]. All fibrosis biomarkers, except the Pro-C3 level, correlated with the fibrosis stage. M2BPGi was better than other biomarkers for diagnosing ≥F2, with the highest area under the curve of 0.902. M2BPGi demonstrated a higher diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis than mild/severe fibrosis or cirrhosis. However, no significant correlation was observed between the M2BPGi level and fibrosis stage in patients with CHB having significant liver necroinflammation defined as ≥ necroinflammatory activity 2. The M2BPGi level and PLT count were exclusively correlated with the fibrosis stage in 73 patients without significant liver necroinflammation. M2BPGi demonstrated the highest diagnostic performance for significant fibrosis in patients having significant liver fibrosis with no significant liver necroinflammation. In conclusion, the M2BPGi level can accurately diagnose significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB.",

This study evaluated the performance of WFA+ -M2BP in predicting fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. A total of 80 patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) were enrolled. Serum WFA+ -M2BP levels were measured using standard methods. The fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index was also measured. The mean values of WFA+ -M2BP were 1.0, 1.0, 0.8, and 2.2 in Metavir fibrosis stage F0, F1, F2, and F3-4, respectively (linear trend p = 0.005). The optimal cut-off value of WFA+ -M2BP in predicting advanced fibrosis (F3-4) was 1.37 cut-off index (COI), yielding the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, and accuracy of 75.0, 79.4, 39.1, 94.7, and 78.7%, respectively (p < 0.001). Combining WFA+ -M2BP with FIB-4 significantly increased the diagnostic performance for advanced fibrosis, yielding specificity, PPV, and accuracy of 100, 100, and 93%, respectively. The significant factors predicting advanced liver fibrosis in the multivariate regression analysis were WFA+ -M2BP ≥ 1.37 COI (OR/confidence interval [CI]: 9.49/1.63-55.21, p = 0.01) and FIB-4 ≥ 2.80 (OR/CI: 38.18/4.89-297.93, p = 0.001).

We undertook a retrospective matched cohort study using a UK-based primary care database, Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum, to determine symptoms that are associated with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection beyond 12 weeks in non-hospitalized adults and the risk factors associated with developing persistent symptoms. We selected 486,149 adults with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 1,944,580 propensity score-matched adults with no recorded evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Outcomes included 115 individual symptoms, as well as long COVID, defined as a composite outcome of 33 symptoms by the World Health Organization clinical case definition. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for the outcomes. A total of 62 symptoms were significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection after 12 weeks.

    "referenceConclusion": "Pre-conditioning significantly reduced the severity of creatine kinase release, delayed-onset muscle soreness, loss of maximal voluntary contraction force and the range of motion decrease. Pre-conditioning may prevent severe EIMD and accelerate recovery of muscle force generation capacity. The current systematic review identified that pre-conditioning activities are effective in attenuating EIMD measures, CK, muscle soreness, ROM and maximal voluntary force production. These findings suggest the use of pre-conditioning activities prior to a strenuous bout of exercise does provide a significant protective effect when performed a minimum of 24 h prior to the damaging stimulus. Furthermore, the greater improvement in MVC suggests that the pre-conditioning activities may accelerate the recovery of muscle contractile properties following strenuous exercises. However, it is unclear if pre-conditioning would prevent EIMD from more complex exercises or to what extent EIMD prevention carries over into other modes of exercise.",

      "# Title: Muscle tenderness and peak torque changes after downhill running following a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: Unaccustomed exercise (usually of an eccentric nature) is often followed by delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Previous studies have found that prior eccentric activity produces a training effect which reduces DOMS and morphological changes. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a prior bout of maximal isokinetic eccentric exercise on DOMS, strength loss and plasma creatine kinase (CK) changes following a downhill run. Ten male subjects with a mean (+/- S.D.) age of 22.5 +/- 2.8 years, body mass of 62.67 +/- 0.05 kg and height of 176 +/- 3 cm were allocated to either a treatment group or a control group. The treatment group performed 100 maximal eccentric activations of the knee extensors in the dominant leg at 0.52 rad s-1. Two weeks later, the downhill run was performed on a motor-driven treadmill. This consisted of five bouts of 8 min at a gradient of -10% at a speed corresponding to 80% of the predicted maximal heart rate. The untrained group performed the downhill run as above but without the prior isokinetic session. Tenderness measurements, plasma CK activity and concentric and eccentric isokinetic peak torque measurements of the knee extensors at 0.52 and 2.83 rad s-1 were recorded prior to, immediately following and 2, 4 and 7 days after each protocol. The isokinetic protocol caused an increase (P < 0.01) in CK and tenderness and a decrease (P < 0.05) in concentric and eccentric torque at both speeds in the treatment group. Following the downhill run, a reduction in peak torque (P < 0.01) was observed in the eccentric and concentric modes at both isokinetic speeds in the control group. For the treatment group, the decrease in peak torque occurred only at the faster eccentric speed. With the exception of the faster eccentric speed, the decrement in peak torque was greater in the control group in all post-exercise isokinetic strength tests. There was less tenderness (P < 0.01) in the trained knee extensor muscle group. Peak torque also returned to pre-downhill values earlier for the trained group. Although plasma CK activity increased in both groups after downhill running, it was much lower (P < 0.01) in the trained group. The results suggest that a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric training reduces muscle damage, reduces the amount of strength loss and decreases the sensation of DOMS after downhill running.",
      "# Title: Exercise-induced skeletal muscle damage and adaptation following repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions.\n# Abstract: Repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions were used to examine indirect indices of exercise-induced muscle damage and adaptation in human skeletal muscle. Twenty-four subjects (18 females, 6 males) aged 20.0 +/- 1.4 years (mean +/- S.D.) performed an initial bout of either 10 (n = 7), 30 (n = 9) or 50 (n = 8) maximum voluntary eccentric contractions of the knee extensors, followed by a second bout of 50 contractions 3 weeks later using the same leg. Muscle soreness was elevated after all bouts (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon test), although the initial bout reduced the soreness associated with the second bout. Force loss and a decline in the 20:100 Hz percutaneous electrical myostimulation force ratio were observed after all exercise bouts (P < 0.01). Serum creatine kinase activity was elevated following the initial bouts of 30 and 50 repetitions (P < 0.01), but there was no increase following 10 repetitions. No increase in serum creatine kinase activity was observed in any group following the second bout of contractions (P > 0.05). We conclude that skeletal muscle adaptation can be brought about by a single bout of relatively few eccentric muscle contractions. Increasing the number of eccentric muscle repetitions did not result in an increased prophylactic effect on skeletal muscle.",
      "# Title: Influence of previous concentric exercise on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether a fatiguing concentric exercise performed immediately before eccentric exercise would exacerbate eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. One arm of nine female subjects (mean +/- s: 23.3 +/- 6.7 years) performed 12 maximal eccentric actions of the elbow flexors (ECC), and the other arm performed 100 repetitions of isokinetic concentric actions of the elbow flexors followed by the same eccentric exercise (CON-ECC). The two exercise regimens (ECC and CON-ECC) were separated by 2 weeks and presented in a counterbalanced order. Changes in muscle soreness level, maximal isometric force generation, relaxed and flexed elbow joint angle, upper arm circumference and plasma creatine kinase activity were compared between the ECC and CON-ECC conditions. All measures changed significantly after both ECC and CON-ECC; however, there were significant differences in the changes between the conditions. A lower level of soreness, a faster recovery of maximal isometric force generation, a smaller decrease in relaxed elbow joint angle and a smaller increase in upper arm circumference and creatine kinase activity were evident after the CON-ECC condition compared to the ECC condition. Thus, it would seem that muscle damage was attenuated by performance of previous concentric exercise. An additional experiment using a different group of subjects (n = 5) showed that warm-up exercise before the eccentric exercise also attenuated eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Acute adaptation to low volume eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: Many symptoms of eccentric muscle damage can be substantially reduced if a similar eccentric bout is repeated within several weeks of the initial bout. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a nondamaging, low repetition, low volume eccentric exercise bout could also provide a protective/adaptive effect.",
      "# Title: The repeated bout effect of reduced-load eccentric exercise on elbow flexor muscle damage.\n# Abstract: In this study we investigated the extent to which an initial eccentric exercise consisting of two (2ECC) or six maximal eccentric actions (6ECC) of the elbow flexors would produce a similar effect to 24 maximal eccentric actions (24ECC), on a second bout of 24ECC performed 2 weeks later. Male students (n = 34) were assigned to one of three groups, and with their non-dominant arm performed either 2ECC (n = 12), 6ECC (n = 10), or 24ECC (n = 12) as a first bout of exercise. Two weeks later all groups performed 24ECC. Maximal isometric strength, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration were assessed before, immediately after, and for 4 days after exercise. Changes in all variables were compared between the bouts and groups by a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance. All variables changed significantly (P< 0.05) after 2ECC, 6ECC, and 24ECC, but the amount of change after 2ECC and 6ECC was significantly smaller (P<0.05) than both 6ECC and 24ECC, and 24ECC, respectively. After the second bout, the 6ECC and 24ECC groups showed a profound repeated bout effect, and no significant differences were found between the groups. All variables except muscle soreness were significantly (P< 0.05) larger after the second bout for the 2ECC group, however the changes observed after 24ECC were significantly smaller (P < 0.01) than those observed after the first 24ECC of the 24ECC group. These results suggest that it is not necessary to conduct a high number of eccentric actions in the first bout to elicit a repeated bout effect in a subsequent bout performed some time later.",

      "# Title: Intensity of eccentric exercise, shift of optimum angle, and the magnitude of repeated-bout effect.\n# Abstract: This study compared the effect of four different intensities of initial eccentric exercise (ECC1) on optimum angle shift and extent of muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise. Fifty-two male students were placed into 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% groups (n = 13 per group), performing 30 eccentric actions of the elbow flexors of 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% of maximal isometric strength [maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)] for ECC1, followed 2-3 wk later by a similar exercise (ECC2) that used 100% MVC load. MVC at six elbow joint angles, range of motion, upper arm circumference, serum creatine kinase activity, myoglobin concentration, and muscle soreness were measured before and for 5 days following ECC1 and ECC2. A rightward shift of optimum angle following ECC1 was significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 100% and 80% than for the 60% and 40% groups, and it decreased significantly (P < 0.05) from immediately to 5 days postexercise. By the time ECC2 was performed, only the 100% group kept a significant shift (4 degrees). Changes in most of the criterion measures following ECC1 were significantly greater for the 100% and 80% groups compared with the 60% and 40% groups. Changes in the criterion measures following ECC2 were significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 40% group compared with other groups. Although the magnitude of repeated bout effect following ECC2 was significantly (P < 0.05) smaller for the 40% and 60% groups, all groups showed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced changes in criterion measures following ECC2 compared with the ECC1 100% bout. We conclude that the repeated-bout effect was not dependent on the shift of optimum angle.",
      "# Title: Repeated bout effect after maximal eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: We hypothesized that a bout of high or low volume eccentric exercise would protect against muscle damage following a subsequent high volume bout and that adaptation would be attributable to neural changes, independent of the initial exercise volume. Sixteen males performed either 45 (ECC45) or 10 (ECC10) maximal eccentric contractions using the elbow flexors, followed by an ECC45 bout 2 weeks later. Damage markers were measured for the following 96 h; EMG and work done during the first 10 eccentric contractions were also recorded. CK, soreness, and decrements in MVC and range of motion (ROM) were greater in bout 1 than bout 2 (p < 0.01). Soreness, MVC and ROM were greater after the initial ECC45 bout compared to the initial ECC10 bout and the repeated bouts of ECC45 exercise in both groups (p < 0.01). Median frequency decreased from bout 1 to bout 2 (p < 0.001), no differences between groups were observed. An ECC45 bout of maximal eccentric exercise causes more initial damage than an ECC10 bout of maximal eccentric exercise, although both confer protection from subsequent ECC45 bouts of maximal eccentric contractions, which are attributable, at least in part, to a shift in the frequency content of EMG.",
      "# Title: A light load eccentric exercise confers protection against a subsequent bout of more demanding eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that a light eccentric exercise (ECC) that does not induce a loss of muscle function and delayed onset muscle soreness would confer a protective effect against a more strenuous ECC. Eighteen young men were randomly placed into two groups: 10-40% (n=9) and 40% (n=9). Subjects in the 10-40% group performed ECC of the elbow flexors (six sets of five reps) using a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (MVC) at an elbow joint angle of 90 degrees , followed 2 days later by ECC using a dumbbell weight of 40% MVC. Subjects in the 40% group performed the 40% ECC only. Changes in MVC, range of motion (ROM), upper arm circumference (CIR), plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and muscle soreness before, immediately after, 1-5 and 7 days following the 40% ECC were compared between groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any of the criterion measures were found immediately and 1-2 days after the 10% ECC. Following the 40% ECC, the 10-40% group showed significantly (P<0.05) smaller decreases in MVC and ROM, and smaller increases in muscle soreness compared with the 40% group, but no significant differences between groups were evident for CIR and plasma CK activity. These results suggest that the 10% ECC induced some protection against a subsequent bout of 40% ECC performed 2 days later. It appears that the light eccentric exercise preconditioned the muscles for exposure to the subsequent damaging eccentric exercise bout.",
      "# Title: Protection against muscle damage following fifty drop jumps conferred by ten drop jumps.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether 10 drop jumps (DJs) would confer protective effect against muscle damage and soreness in a subsequent bout of 50 DJs. Sixteen men were randomly placed into either a group performing 1 set of 10 DJs followed by 5 sets of 10 DJs (10-50, n = 8) or another group performing 2 bouts of 5 sets of 10 DJs (50-50, n = 8) separated by 2 weeks. The DJs were performed from a box height of 0.6 m, with a 10-second interval between jumps and a 1-minute rest between sets. Jump height, peak vertical ground reaction force, ground contact time, and heart rate during DJs were measured, and blood lactate concentration was assessed before and immediately after DJs. Changes in maximal isometric (ISO) and isokinetic concentric torque (CON), vertical jump, muscle soreness, and plasma creatine kinase activity before, immediately after, and at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours following exercise were compared between groups for the first and second bouts and between the bouts by a 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance. Changes in ISO, CON, vertical jump, and muscle soreness were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller for 10 DJs compared with 50 DJs; however, no significant differences in the measures between groups were evident following the second bout. The changes in the measures following 50 DJs in the 10-50 group were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller than those following the first bout of the 50-50 group. These results suggest that 10 DJs and 50 DJs conferred the same magnitude of protective effect against muscle damage by 50 DJs.",
      "# Title: Muscle damage protection by low-intensity eccentric contractions remains for 2 weeks but not 3 weeks.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that the protective effect conferred by a low-intensity eccentric exercise against maximal eccentric exercise would not last more than a week. Untrained men (21.3 ± 1.6 years) were allocated into either a control or one of four repeated bout groups (n = 13 per group). The repeated bout groups performed 30 low-intensity eccentric contractions (ECC) of the elbow flexors with a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (10%-ECC) either 2 days, 7 days (1 week), 14 days (2 weeks) or 21 days (3 weeks) before 30 maximal eccentric contractions (Max-ECC). The control group performed Max-ECC only. Changes in maximal voluntary contraction strength, optimum angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following 10%-ECC were analysed by a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Changes in the variables following Max-ECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. The 10%-ECC did not change any variables, showing no indication of muscle damage. The changes in all variables following Max-ECC were smaller (P < 0.05) for 2-day, 1- and 2-week groups than control group, without significant differences between 2-day and 1-week groups. The 2-week group showed greater (P < 0.05) changes in all variables compared with 2-day and 1-week groups. Changes in the variables were similar between 3-week and control groups, except for muscle soreness showing smaller (P < 0.05) changes for 3-week group. These results suggest that non-damaging eccentric exercise confers a protective effect against Max-Ecc, but the effect is attenuated between 1 and 2 weeks.",
      "# Title: Two maximal isometric contractions attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVC-ISO) would attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. Young untrained men were placed into one of the two experimental groups or one control group (n = 13 per group). Subjects in the experimental groups performed either two or 10 MVC-ISO of the elbow flexors at a long muscle length (20° flexion) 2 days prior to 30 maximal isokinetic eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors. Subjects in the control group performed the eccentric contractions without MVC-ISO. No significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction peak torque, peak torque angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and myoglobin concentration, muscle soreness, and ultrasound echo intensity were evident after MVC-ISO. Changes in the variables following eccentric contractions were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2 MVC-ISO group (e.g., peak torque loss at 5 days after exercise, 23% ± 3%; peak CK activity, 1964 ± 452 IU·L(-1); peak muscle soreness, 46 ± 4 mm) or the 10 MVC-ISO group (13% ± 3%, 877 ± 198 IU·L(-1), 30 ± 4 mm) compared with the control (34% ± 4%, 6192 ± 1747 IU·L(-1), 66 ± 5 mm). The 10 MVC-ISO group showed smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following eccentric contractions compared with the 2 MVC-ISO group. Therefore, two MVC-ISO conferred potent protective effects against muscle damage, whereas greater protective effect was induced by 10 MVC-ISO, which can be used as a strategy to minimize muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Attenuation of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage by preconditioning exercises.\n# Abstract: This study compared the effect of an initial exercise consisting of either low-intensity eccentric or maximal isometric contractions (ISOs) on protective effect against maximal eccentric contraction (MaxECC)-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions attenuate muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise of the knee extensors in the elderly.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors would attenuate the magnitude of muscle damage induced by maximal eccentric exercise of the same muscle performed 7 days later using elderly individuals. Healthy older men (66.4 ± 4.6 years) were assigned to control or experimental (Exp) group (n = 13 per group). The control group performed six sets of ten maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC) of the knee extensors of non-dominant leg. The Exp group performed six sets of ten low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors on a leg extension machine by lowering a weight of 10 % maximal voluntary isometric knee extension strength (10 %ECC) 7 days prior to MaxECC. Changes in maximal voluntary isokinetic concentric torque (MVC-CON), angle at peak torque, range of motion (ROM), upper thigh circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin (Mb) concentration and B-mode ultrasound echo-intensity before and for 5 days after MaxECC were compared between groups by a mixed factor ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were observed following 10 %ECC. Following MaxECC, all variables changed significantly, and changes in all variables except for angle at peak torque were significantly different between groups. MVC-CON and ROM decreased smaller and recovered faster (P < 0.05) for Exp than control group, and changes in other variables were smaller (P < 0.05) for Exp group compared with control group. These results suggest that preconditioning knee extensor muscles with low-intensity eccentric contractions was effective for attenuating muscle damage induced by subsequent MaxECC of the knee extensors for elderly individuals.",
      "# Title: Effect of two maximal isometric contractions on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the elbow flexors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the time wise protective effect conferred by two maximal voluntary isometric contractions (2MVCs) at 20° elbow flexion on muscle damage induced by 30 maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors (MaxECC). Sixty-five young untrained men were randomly assigned to a control group that did not perform 2MVCs, or one of four experimental groups (n = 13 per group) who performed 2MVCs either immediately (0d), 2 (2d), 4 (4d) or 7 days (7d) before MaxECC. Changes in maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) concentric torque (MVC-CON), optimum angle (OA), range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following MaxECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were evident following 2MVCs. The 2d and 4d groups showed 16-62 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following MaxECC than the control, 0d and 7d groups. The 2d group showed 14-34 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables except for OA compared with the 4d group. The changes in the variables were similar among the control, 0d and 7d groups. These results show that 2MVCs that were performed between 2 and 4 days before MaxECC attenuated the magnitude of muscle damage, but no such effect was evident if the 2MVCs were performed immediately or 7 days before MaxECC. It is concluded that the protective effect conferred by 2MVCs is relatively short-lived, and there is a window for the effect to be conferred.",
      "# Title: Effect of a prior bout of preconditioning exercise on muscle damage from downhill walking.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether reduced-duration downhill walking (DW) would confer a protective effect against muscle damage induced by a subsequent bout of longer duration DW performed 1 week or 4 weeks later. Healthy young adults were allocated to a control or one of the preconditioning exercise (PRE-1wk or PRE-4wk) groups (10 men and 4 women per group). PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups performed 20-min DW (-28% slope, 5 km/h, 10% body mass added to a backpack) 1 week and 4 weeks before 40-min DW, respectively, and the control group performed 40-min DW only. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) knee extension torque, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity, and muscle soreness (100-mm visual analog scale) were measured before, immediately after, and 24, 48, and 72 h after DW, and the changes in these variables were compared among groups. The control group showed symptoms of muscle damage (e.g., prolonged decrease in MVC: -14% ± 10% at 48 h post-DW) after 40-min DW. Changes in all variables after 40-min DW of PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups were 54%-61% smaller (P < 0.05) than the control group, without significant differences between PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups for MVC and plasma CK activity. Importantly, changes after the preconditioning exercise (20-min DW) were 67%-69% smaller (P < 0.05) than those after the 40-min DW of the control group. These findings suggest that 20-min DW resulting in minor muscle damage conferred a protective effect against subsequent 40-min DW, and its effect could last for more than 4 weeks.",

      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors and flexors protect against muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the magnitude and duration of the protective effect of low-intensity eccentric contractions (LowEC) against damage induced by maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) of the knee flexors (KF) and extensors (KE). Young men were assigned to 8 experimental groups and 2 control groups (n = 13/group); the experimental groups performed LowEC of KF or KE 2 days (2d), 1 week (1wk), 2 weeks (2wk), or 3 weeks (3wk) before MaxEC, while the control groups performed MaxEC of KF or KE without LowEC. The 2d, 1wk, 2wk, and 3wk groups performed 30 LowEC of KF or 60 LowEC of KE with a load of 10% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction strength on a resistance-training machine, and all groups performed 30 MaxEC of KF or 60 MaxEC of KE on an isokinetic dynamometer. Several muscle damage markers were measured from before to 2 days after exercise (LowEC) or from before to 5 days after exercise (MaxEC). No significant changes in any variables were evident after LowEC. The changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2d and 1wk groups (e.g., peak creatine kinase activity: 1002 ± 501 IU/L; peak muscle soreness: 13 ± 5 mm) than for the control group (peak creatine kinase activity: 3005 ± 983 IU/L; peak muscle soreness 28 ± 6 mm) for both KE and KF. There were no significant differences between the 2d and 1wk groups or among the 2wk, 3wk, and control groups. These results show that LowEC provided 30%-66% protection against damage induced by MaxEC of KF and KE, and the protective effect lasted 1 week.",

Untrained men were placed to an experimental group that performed 6 sets of 10 MVIC at 90° knee flexion 2 weeks before 6 sets of 10 MaxEC or a control group that performed MaxEC only (n = 13/group). Changes in muscle damage markers were assessed before to 5 days after each exercise. Small but significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction torque, range of motion (ROM) and plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity were evident at immediately to 2 days post-MVIC (p < 0.05), but other variables (e.g. thigh girth, myoglobin concentration, B-mode echo intensity) did not change significantly. Changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (p < 0.05) by 45% (soreness)-67% (CK) for the experimental than the control group.

      "# Title: Prevention of downhill walking-induced muscle damage by non-damaging downhill walking.\n# Abstract: Mountain trekking involves level, uphill, and downhill walking (DW). Prolonged DW induces damage to leg muscles, reducing force generating ability and muscle coordination. These increase risks for more serious injuries and accidents in mountain trekking, thus a strategy to minimize muscle damage is warranted. It has been shown that low-intensity eccentric contractions confer protective effect on muscle damage induced by high-intensity eccentric contractions. This study tested the hypothesis that 5-min non-damaging DW would attenuate muscle damage induced by 40-min DW, but 5-min level walking (LW) would not.",
      "# Title: Isometric pre-conditioning blunts exercise-induced muscle damage but does not attenuate changes in running economy following downhill running.\n# Abstract: Running economy (RE) is impaired following unaccustomed eccentric-biased exercises that induce muscle damage. It is also known that muscle damage is reduced when maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) are performed at a long muscle length 2-4 days prior to maximal eccentric exercise with the same muscle, a phenomenon that can be described as isometric pre-conditioning (IPC). We tested the hypothesis that IPC could attenuate muscle damage and changes in RE following downhill running. Thirty untrained men were randomly assigned into experimental or control groups and ran downhill on a treadmill (-15%) for 30 min. Participants in the experimental group completed 10 MVIC in a leg press machine two days prior to downhill running, while participants in the control group did not perform IPC. The magnitude of changes in muscle soreness determined 48 h after downhill running was greater for the control group (122 ± 28 mm) than for the experimental group (92 ± 38 mm). Isometric peak torque recovered faster in the experimental group compared with the control group (3 days vs. no full recovery, respectively). No significant effect of IPC was found for countermovement jump height, serum creatine kinase activity or any parameters associated with RE. These results supported the hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in markers of muscle damage. The hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in RE was not supported by our data. It appears that the mechanisms involved in changes in markers of muscle damage and parameters associated with RE following downhill running are not completely shared.",

However, it is not known whether this strategy could be applied to other muscles. This study investigated whether 10% EC would confer damage protective effect on high-intensity eccentric contractions (80% EC) for nine different muscle groups.",
      "# Title: Protective Effect Conferred by Isometric Preconditioning Against Slow- and Fast-Velocity Eccentric Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage.\n# Abstract: We investigated if the same isometric preconditioning protocol (IPP) attenuates the magnitude of muscle damage induced by different maximal eccentric exercise protocols in the elbow flexors. Sixty-four untrained men were assigned to either two experimental or two control groups. Participants in the experimental groups performed an IPP prior to either slow (60°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-S) or fast (180°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-F) maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC). Subjects in the control groups performed slow (ECC-S) or fast (ECC-F) MaxECC without IPP. Maximal isokinetic concentric torque (MVC), muscle soreness (SOR), and muscle thickness (MT) were assessed before, immediately after, and 1-4 days following the MaxECC. Significant (p < 0.05) group vs. time interactions were found for MVC (F = 4,517), SOR (F = 6,318), and MT (F = 1,863). The ECC-S group presented faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and MT and less (p < 0.05) SOR at 96 h post-MaxECC compared with ECC-F group. No significant differences in MVC and MT were found between ECC-S and ECC-F groups following MaxECC. The ISO + ECC-S group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and SOR compared to the ECC-S group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ECC-S in any variable. The ISO + ECC-F group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of all assessed variables compared with the ECC-F group. MVC was greater (p < 0.05) at 48-72 h, and SOR was less (p < 0.05) at 48-96 h in the ISO + ECC-F compared to the ECC-F group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ISO + ECC-F for any variable. These results show that the IPP accelerated recovery of MVC and SOR for the slow-eccentric exercise condition and attenuated strength loss and SOR in addition to faster recovery of all assessed variables for the fast-eccentric exercise condition. Therefore, the IPP can be used as a strategy to attenuate and accelerate recovery of muscle damage induced by different-velocity eccentric exercises, resulting in greater protection against muscle damage induced by faster velocity."

      "conclusionA": "Eccentric exercise, performed at a submaximal intensity, currently stands out as the most effective pre-conditioning strategy for reducing Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage (EIMD); however, the magnitude of this effect is significantly moderated by participant characteristics – notably training status and sex – and the specific muscle group targeted, necessitating individualized and nuanced application of pre-conditioning protocols.",
      "conclusionB": "Performing a prior bout of low-to-moderate volume eccentric or isometric exercise—even as little as two maximal isometric contractions or 10-50 eccentric actions—significantly attenuates subsequent exercise-induced muscle damage, typically within a window of 1-2 weeks, regardless of exercise modality (downhill walking, elbow flexors, knee extensors) or contraction velocity; however, this protective effect is not sustained beyond 2-3 weeks."

      "# Title: Long-Term Follow-Up of Patients With Previous Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for Chronic Total Occlusion.\n# Abstract: Successful revascularization of chronic total occlusions (CTOs) has been associated with clinical benefit. Data on outcomes in patients with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for CTO, however, are scarce. A total of 2,002 consecutive patients undergoing PCI for CTO from January 2005 to December 2013 were divided into patients with and without previous CABG, and outcomes were retrospectively assessed. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality. Median follow-up was 2.6 years (interquartile range 1.1 to 3.1). A total of 292 patients (15%) had previous CABG; they were older and had a greater prevalence of comorbidities. Procedural success was achieved in 75% and 84% of patients in the previous CABG and the non-CABG groups (p <0.001), respectively. All-cause mortality was 16% and 11% in the previous CABG and the non-CABG groups (p = 0.002), and differences were mitigated after adjustment for baseline characteristics (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86 to 1.74, p = 0.27). All-cause death was significantly reduced in patients with procedural success, both in the previous CABG (11% vs 32%, adjusted HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.77, p = 0.005) and the non-CABG groups (10% vs 20%, adjusted HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.86, p = 0.004), with similar mortality benefits associated with successful revascularization in both groups (interaction p = 0.24). In conclusion, the relative survival benefit of successful recanalization of CTO is independent of previous CABG. However, owing to a greater baseline risk, the absolute survival benefit of successful CTO procedures is more pronounced in patients with previous CABG than in non-CABG patients.",

    "referenceConclusion": "High PM 2.5 exposure is one of the most important avoidable hazards to human health. The effects on hematological systems have been less well-studied. There were fewer than 20 available entries in the web search according to the Cochrane recommendation as the damages are not easily analyzed and are mostly unnoticed. All available studies found harmful effects of long-term exposure to PM 2.5 to the hematopoietic system. Hematological parameter changes in people exposed to medium to high PM 2.5 concentrations for more than a year are summarized in Table 2 . The pathophysiology of PM 2.5 pollution may be from increased inflammatory responses affecting each hematological component. For the public, avoidance of exposure and reduction in PM 2.5 pollution should be encouraged. Interventions should be focused on the high-risk groups including the elderly with cardiovascular diseases, young children, and pregnant women. Personal facemasks can minimize inhaled small particles and reduce pollution exposure time. Air purifiers also lessen indoor pollution concentrations. Improving air quality has to be addressed for the general population. Decreasing PM 2.5 pollution is essential to prevent hematological adverse events. Further studies are needed to determine whether reducing PM 2.5 exposure can decrease these disorders. Pathophysiology of PM 2.5 effects on individual hematologic parameters and the high-risk groups. High PM 2.5 : A 24-h mean level between 25 and 50 μg/m 3 or annual mean over 10 μg/m 3 . Very high PM 2.5 : A 24-h mean level over 50 μg/m 3 .",

      "# Title: Particulate matter air pollution and cardiovascular disease: An update to the scientific statement from the American Heart Association.\n# Abstract: In 2004, the first American Heart Association scientific statement on \"Air Pollution and Cardiovascular Disease\" concluded that exposure to particulate matter (PM) air pollution contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In the interim, numerous studies have expanded our understanding of this association and further elucidated the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved. The main objective of this updated American Heart Association scientific statement is to provide a comprehensive review of the new evidence linking PM exposure with cardiovascular disease, with a specific focus on highlighting the clinical implications for researchers and healthcare providers. The writing group also sought to provide expert consensus opinions on many aspects of the current state of science and updated suggestions for areas of future research. On the basis of the findings of this review, several new conclusions were reached, including the following: Exposure to PM <2.5 microm in diameter (PM(2.5)) over a few hours to weeks can trigger cardiovascular disease-related mortality and nonfatal events; longer-term exposure (eg, a few years) increases the risk for cardiovascular mortality to an even greater extent than exposures over a few days and reduces life expectancy within more highly exposed segments of the population by several months to a few years; reductions in PM levels are associated with decreases in cardiovascular mortality within a time frame as short as a few years; and many credible pathological mechanisms have been elucidated that lend biological plausibility to these findings. It is the opinion of the writing group that the overall evidence is consistent with a causal relationship between PM(2.5) exposure and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This body of evidence has grown and been strengthened substantially since the first American Heart Association scientific statement was published. Finally, PM(2.5) exposure is deemed a modifiable factor that contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.",

      "# Title: Effects of particulate matter exposure on blood 5-hydroxymethylation: results from the Beijing truck driver air pollution study.\n# Abstract: Previous studies have reported epigenetic changes induced by environmental exposures. However, previous investigations did not distinguish 5-methylcytosine (5mC) from a similar oxidative form with opposite functions, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Here, we measured blood DNA global 5mC and 5hmC by ELISA and used adjusted mixed-effects regression models to evaluate the effects of ambient PM10 and personal PM2.5 and its elemental components-black carbon (BC), aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), iron (Fe), sulfur (S), silicon (Si), titanium (Ti), and zinc (Zn)-on blood global 5mC and 5hmC levels. The study was conducted in 60 truck drivers and 60 office workers in Beijing, China from The Beijing Truck Driver Air Pollution Study at 2 exams separated by one to 2 weeks. Blood 5hmC level (0.08%) was ∼83-fold lower than 5mC (6.61%). An inter-quartile range (IQR) increase in same-day PM10 was associated with increases in 5hmC of 26.1% in office workers (P = 0.004), 20.2% in truck drivers (P = 0.014), and 21.9% in all participants combined (P < 0.001). PM10 effects on 5hmC were increasingly stronger when averaged over 4, 7, and 14 d preceding assessment (up to 132.6% for the 14-d average in all participants, P < 0.001). PM10 effects were also significant after controlling for multiple testing (family-wise error rate; FWER < 0.05). 5hmC was not correlated with personal measures of PM2.5 and elemental components (FWER > 0.05). 5mC showed no correlations with PM10, PM2.5, and elemental components measures (FWER > 0.05). Our study suggests that exposure to ambient PM10 affects 5hmC over time, but not 5mC. This finding demonstrates the need to differentiate 5hmC and 5mC in environmental studies of DNA methylation.",
      "# Title: Environmental nanoparticles are significantly over-expressed in acute myeloid leukemia.\n# Abstract: The increase in the incidence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) may suggest a possible environmental etiology. PM2.5 was declared by IARC a Class I carcinogen. No report has focused on particulate environmental pollution together with AML. The study investigated the presence and composition of particulate matter in blood with a Scanning Electron Microscope coupled with an Energy Dispersive Spectroscope, a sensor capable of identifying the composition of foreign bodies. 38 peripheral blood samples, 19 AML cases and 19 healthy controls, were analyzed. A significant overload of particulate matter-derived nanoparticles linked or aggregated to blood components was found in AML patients, while almost absent in matched healthy controls. Two-tailed Student's t-test, MANOVA and Principal Component Analysis indicated that the total numbers of aggregates and particles were statistically different between cases and controls (MANOVA, P<0.001 and P=0.009 respectively). The particles detected showed to contain highly-reactive, non-biocompatible and non-biodegradable metals; in particular, micro- and nano-sized particles grouped in organic/inorganic clusters, with statistically higher frequency of a subgroup of elements in AML samples. The demonstration, for the first time, of an overload of nanoparticles linked to blood components in AML patients could be the basis for a possible, novel pathogenetic mechanism for AML development.",

      "# Title: Increased Outdoor PM2.5 Concentration Is Associated with Moderate/Severe Anemia in Children Aged 6-59 Months in Lima, Peru.\n# Abstract: Anemia affects 1.62 billion people worldwide. Although iron deficiency is the main cause of anemia, several other factors may explain its high prevalence. In this study, we sought to analyze the association between outdoor particulate matter PM2.5 levels with anemia prevalence in children aged 6-59 months residing in Lima, Peru (n = 139,368), one of the cities with the worst air pollution in Latin America. The study period was from 2012 to 2016. Anemia was defined according to the World Health Organization (Hb < 11 g/dL). PM2.5 values were estimated by a mathematical model that combined data observed from monitors, with satellite and meteorological data. PM2.5 was analyzed by quintiles. Multiple linear and logistic regressions were used to estimate the associations between hemoglobin concentration (beta) and anemia (odds ratio) with PM2.5, after adjusting by covariates. Prevalence of anemia was 39.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 39.3-39.9). Mild anemia was observed in 30.8% of children and moderate/severe in 8.84% of children. Anemic children compared with nonanemic children are mainly males, have low body weight, higher rate of stunting, and live in an environment with high PM2.5 concentration. A slight decrease in hemoglobin (4Q B: -0.03, 95% CI: -0.05 to -0.02; 5Q B: -0.04, 95% CI: -0.06 to -0.01) and an increase in the probability of moderate/severe anemia (4Q OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.10-1.27; 5Q OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.08-1.29) were observed with increased exposure to PM2.5. We conclude that outdoor PM2.5 levels were significantly associated with decreased hemoglobin values and an increase in prevalence of moderate/severe anemia in children under 5 years old.",

In this nationwide register-based case-control study, we focus on specific components of PM2.5 in relation to childhood NHL in Denmark (1981-2013) by identifying all incidents of childhood NHL cases in the Danish Cancer Registry (n = 170) and four (cancer-free) randomly selected controls matched by date of birth and sex. We applied PM2.5 concentrations and the following sub-components: secondary organic aerosols (SOA), secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA; i.e., NO3-, NH4+ and SO42-), BC, organic carbon (OC) and sea salt. We calculated a time-weighted exposure average from birth to index-date at all addresses. Odds ratios (ORs) were adjusted for register-based socio-demographic variables. We observed adjusted ORs and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of 2.05 (1.10, 3.83) per interquartile range (IQR, 4.83 µg/m3) PM2.5 and 1.73 (0.68, 4.41) per IQR (3.71 µg/m3) SIA, 0.95 (0.71, 1.29) per IQR (0.05 µg/m3) SOA, 1.22 (1.02, 1.46) per IQR (0.39 µg/m3) BC, 1.02 (0.83, 1.26) per IQR (0.56 µg/m3) OC and 1.01 (0.79, 1.30) per IQR (0.87 µg/m3) sea salt, respectively. The estimates were attenuated after adjustment for PM2.5, whereas the OR for PM2.5 remained increased regardless of adjustment for specific components. The findings indicate that the previously observed relation between PM2.5 and childhood NHL may be related to BC (as reported in our previous study) but also partly to SIA, but the role of specific chemical components of PM2.5 remains ambiguous."

We examined WFA+ -M2BP levels in patients with F4 (cirrhosis), F3 or more (advanced fibrosis) and F2 or more (significant fibrosis) in the two groups. We further examined the relationship between five fibrosis markers and the degree of fibrosis. The WFA+ -M2BP values ranged from 0.25 cut-off index (COI) to 12.9 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 0.34-20.0 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P<.0001). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F4 in the two groups were 2.83 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 5.03 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P=.0046). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F3 or more in the two groups were 1.79 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 3.79 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P<.0001).

Consecutive adult NAFLD patients who had a liver biopsy were included. Serum WFA+-M2BP level was measured using a lectin-antibody sandwich immunoassay using a chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay machine (HISCL-5000, Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). The measured levels were indexed using the following equation: Cut-off index (COI) = ([WFA+-M2BP]sample-[WFA+-M2BP]NC) / ([WFA+-M2BP]PC-[WFA+-M2BP]NC), where PC = positive control and NC = negative control. Histopathological examination of liver biopsy specimen was reported according to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Clinical Research Network Scoring System. Data for 220 cases were analyzed. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of NASH was 0.65. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of steatosis grade ≥2 and 3 was 0.64 and 0.53, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of lobular inflammation grade ≥1, ≥2 and 3 was 0.57, 0.68 and 0.59, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of hepatocyte ballooning grade ≥1 and 2 was 0.64 and 0.65, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of fibrosis stage ≥1, ≥2, ≥3 and 4 was 0.61, 0.71, 0.74 and 0.84, respectively. Out of the 220 cases, 152 cases were the same 76 patients who had a repeat liver biopsy after 48 weeks of intervention. The AUROC of the change in the COI to detect improvement in steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning and fibrosis was 0.57, 0.54, 0.59 and 0.52, respectively. In conclusion, serum WFA+-M2BP was most useful for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in NAFLD patients. However, it was less useful for differentiating NASH from non-NASH, and for diagnosis and follow-up of the individual histopathological components of NASH.",

We assessed its efficacy in evaluating liver disease severity in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in Taiwan. The association between WFA+-M2BP and histological features was evaluated among those CHC patients underwent liver biopsy. We also aimed to clarify the factors determining the performance of WFA+-M2BP in CHC. A total of 229 CHC patients were consecutively recruited. The mean value of WFA+-M2BP in patients from F0 to F4 was 1.68, 2.23, 3.45, 3.48, 3.77 respectively (linear trend P = 0.008). Linear regression analysis revealed that alanine aminotransferase (odds ratio [OR]: 0.03, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.02-0.05, P < 0.001), AST (OR: -0.1, 95% CI: -0.02 to -0.01, P < 0.001), and liver fibrosis (OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.01-0.59, P = 0.043) were the independent factors correlated to serum WFA+-M2BP level. The optimal cutoff values of WFA+-M2BP for fibrosis stages F1, F2, F3, and F4 were 1.42, 1.61, 1.42, and 2.67, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the platelet count (OR/CI: -0.009/0.986-0.996, P = <0.001), r-glutamyl transferase (OR/CI: 0.007/1.000-1.013, P = 0.036), and WFA+-M2BP (OR/CI: 0.187/1.057-1.374, P = 0.005).

      "# Title: Comparison of serum fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B.\n# Abstract: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The diagnosis of liver fibrosis has a key role in selecting patients with CHB for antiviral treatment. However, serum biomarkers demonstrate limited diagnostic utility. The present study aimed to compare the performances of fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB and to identify the most appropriate biomarker for these patients. The current study included 96 antiviral-naïve patients with CHB who underwent liver biopsy. METAVIR scoring system was used to assess liver fibrosis and necroinflammation. The diagnostic performances were evaluated of the platelet (PLT) count; the levels of hyaluronan, serum 7S domain of type 4 collagen, procollagen type III N-terminal peptide, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1, Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) and N-terminal type III collagen propeptide (Pro-C3); the fibrosis index based on four factors; the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index; and enhanced liver fibrosis score for identifying significant liver fibrosis [≥fibrosis stage 2 (F2)]. All fibrosis biomarkers, except the Pro-C3 level, correlated with the fibrosis stage. M2BPGi was better than other biomarkers for diagnosing ≥F2, with the highest area under the curve of 0.902. M2BPGi demonstrated a higher diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis than mild/severe fibrosis or cirrhosis. However, no significant correlation was observed between the M2BPGi level and fibrosis stage in patients with CHB having significant liver necroinflammation defined as ≥ necroinflammatory activity 2. The M2BPGi level and PLT count were exclusively correlated with the fibrosis stage in 73 patients without significant liver necroinflammation.

We examined WFA+ -M2BP levels in patients with F4 (cirrhosis), F3 or more (advanced fibrosis) and F2 or more (significant fibrosis) in the two groups. We further examined the relationship between five fibrosis markers and the degree of fibrosis. The WFA+ -M2BP values ranged from 0.25 cut-off index (COI) to 12.9 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 0.34-20.0 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P<.0001). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F4 in the two groups were 2.83 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 5.03 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P=.0046). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F3 or more in the two groups were 1.79 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 3.79 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P<.0001). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F2 or more in the two groups were 1.49 COI in the hepatitis B cohort and 3.19 COI in the hepatitis C group (P<.0001). Among five liver fibrosis markers, WFA+ -M2BP had the highest correlation coefficient (rs =.629) in terms of correlation with the degree of fibrosis in the patients with hepatitis C and had the second highest rs value (.415) in the hepatitis B group. Although WFA+ -M2BP could be a useful indicator of liver fibrosis, WFA+ -M2BP levels in the two groups significantly differed even in the same degree of fibrosis.

Consecutive adult NAFLD patients who had a liver biopsy were included. Serum WFA+-M2BP level was measured using a lectin-antibody sandwich immunoassay using a chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay machine (HISCL-5000, Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). The measured levels were indexed using the following equation: Cut-off index (COI) = ([WFA+-M2BP]sample-[WFA+-M2BP]NC) / ([WFA+-M2BP]PC-[WFA+-M2BP]NC), where PC = positive control and NC = negative control. Histopathological examination of liver biopsy specimen was reported according to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Clinical Research Network Scoring System. Data for 220 cases were analyzed. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of NASH was 0.65. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of steatosis grade ≥2 and 3 was 0.64 and 0.53, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of lobular inflammation grade ≥1, ≥2 and 3 was 0.57, 0.68 and 0.59, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of hepatocyte ballooning grade ≥1 and 2 was 0.64 and 0.65, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of fibrosis stage ≥1, ≥2, ≥3 and 4 was 0.61, 0.71, 0.74 and 0.84, respectively. Out of the 220 cases, 152 cases were the same 76 patients who had a repeat liver biopsy after 48 weeks of intervention. The AUROC of the change in the COI to detect improvement in steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning and fibrosis was 0.57, 0.54, 0.59 and 0.52, respectively. In conclusion, serum WFA+-M2BP was most useful for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in NAFLD patients.

We assessed its efficacy in evaluating liver disease severity in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in Taiwan. The association between WFA+-M2BP and histological features was evaluated among those CHC patients underwent liver biopsy. We also aimed to clarify the factors determining the performance of WFA+-M2BP in CHC. A total of 229 CHC patients were consecutively recruited. The mean value of WFA+-M2BP in patients from F0 to F4 was 1.68, 2.23, 3.45, 3.48, 3.77 respectively (linear trend P = 0.008). Linear regression analysis revealed that alanine aminotransferase (odds ratio [OR]: 0.03, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.02-0.05, P < 0.001), AST (OR: -0.1, 95% CI: -0.02 to -0.01, P < 0.001), and liver fibrosis (OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.01-0.59, P = 0.043) were the independent factors correlated to serum WFA+-M2BP level. The optimal cutoff values of WFA+-M2BP for fibrosis stages F1, F2, F3, and F4 were 1.42, 1.61, 1.42, and 2.67, respectively.

The diagnosis of liver fibrosis has a key role in selecting patients with CHB for antiviral treatment. However, serum biomarkers demonstrate limited diagnostic utility. The present study aimed to compare the performances of fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB and to identify the most appropriate biomarker for these patients. The current study included 96 antiviral-naïve patients with CHB who underwent liver biopsy. METAVIR scoring system was used to assess liver fibrosis and necroinflammation. The diagnostic performances were evaluated of the platelet (PLT) count; the levels of hyaluronan, serum 7S domain of type 4 collagen, procollagen type III N-terminal peptide, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1, Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) and N-terminal type III collagen propeptide (Pro-C3); the fibrosis index based on four factors; the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index; and enhanced liver fibrosis score for identifying significant liver fibrosis [≥fibrosis stage 2 (F2)]. All fibrosis biomarkers, except the Pro-C3 level, correlated with the fibrosis stage. M2BPGi was better than other biomarkers for diagnosing ≥F2, with the highest area under the curve of 0.902. M2BPGi demonstrated a higher diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis than mild/severe fibrosis or cirrhosis. However, no significant correlation was observed between the M2BPGi level and fibrosis stage in patients with CHB having significant liver necroinflammation defined as ≥ necroinflammatory activity 2. The M2BPGi level and PLT count were exclusively correlated with the fibrosis stage in 73 patients without significant liver necroinflammation. M2BPGi demonstrated the highest diagnostic performance for significant fibrosis in patients having significant liver fibrosis with no significant liver necroinflammation. In conclusion, the M2BPGi level can accurately diagnose significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB.",

Our study evaluates the safety of appendectomy performed with SDD in pediatric patients when compared to appendectomy followed by an overnight stay, using a large nationwide database and a strict definition of SDD by using hospital length of stay (LOS). Methods: Using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric (NSQIP-P) registry, we identified patients younger than 18 years of age who underwent outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy, with SDD (n = 2647) or overnight stay (n = 5045). One-to-one propensity score matching was performed to compare 30-day readmission rates and postsurgical complications. Results: Non-Hispanic black race was associated with a higher likelihood of overnight stay after laparoscopic appendectomy. In the propensity score-matched analysis (N = 2443 pairs), SDD was not associated with an increased risk of 30-day unplanned readmission (odds ratio [OR] = 0.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.6-1.4; P = .667) or any 30-day complication (OR = 0.8, 95% CI: 0.6-1.1; P = .258). Conclusion: SDD after laparoscopic appendectomy in pediatric patients was not associated with an increased risk of 30-day hospital admission or complication rate.

We examined WFA+ -M2BP levels in patients with F4 (cirrhosis), F3 or more (advanced fibrosis) and F2 or more (significant fibrosis) in the two groups. We further examined the relationship between five fibrosis markers and the degree of fibrosis. The WFA+ -M2BP values ranged from 0.25 cut-off index (COI) to 12.9 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 0.34-20.0 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P<.0001). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F4 in the two groups were 2.83 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 5.03 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P=.0046). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F3 or more in the two groups were 1.79 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 3.79 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P<.0001).

Consecutive adult NAFLD patients who had a liver biopsy were included. Serum WFA+-M2BP level was measured using a lectin-antibody sandwich immunoassay using a chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay machine (HISCL-5000, Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). The measured levels were indexed using the following equation: Cut-off index (COI) = ([WFA+-M2BP]sample-[WFA+-M2BP]NC) / ([WFA+-M2BP]PC-[WFA+-M2BP]NC), where PC = positive control and NC = negative control. Histopathological examination of liver biopsy specimen was reported according to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Clinical Research Network Scoring System. Data for 220 cases were analyzed. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of NASH was 0.65. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of steatosis grade ≥2 and 3 was 0.64 and 0.53, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of lobular inflammation grade ≥1, ≥2 and 3 was 0.57, 0.68 and 0.59, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of hepatocyte ballooning grade ≥1 and 2 was 0.64 and 0.65, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of fibrosis stage ≥1, ≥2, ≥3 and 4 was 0.61, 0.71, 0.74 and 0.84, respectively. Out of the 220 cases, 152 cases were the same 76 patients who had a repeat liver biopsy after 48 weeks of intervention. The AUROC of the change in the COI to detect improvement in steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning and fibrosis was 0.57, 0.54, 0.59 and 0.52, respectively. In conclusion, serum WFA+-M2BP was most useful for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in NAFLD patients. However, it was less useful for differentiating NASH from non-NASH, and for diagnosis and follow-up of the individual histopathological components of NASH.",
      "# Title: Serum Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2-binding protein expression predicts disease severity in chronic hepatitis C patients.\n# Abstract: Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein (WFA+-M2BP) has recently been developed as a promising liver fibrosis glyco biomarker. We assessed its efficacy in evaluating liver disease severity in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in Taiwan. The association between WFA+-M2BP and histological features was evaluated among those CHC patients underwent liver biopsy. We also aimed to clarify the factors determining the performance of WFA+-M2BP in CHC. A total of 229 CHC patients were consecutively recruited. The mean value of WFA+-M2BP in patients from F0 to F4 was 1.68, 2.23, 3.45, 3.48, 3.77 respectively (linear trend P = 0.008). Linear regression analysis revealed that alanine aminotransferase (odds ratio [OR]: 0.03, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.02-0.05, P < 0.001), AST (OR: -0.1, 95% CI: -0.02 to -0.01, P < 0.001), and liver fibrosis (OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.01-0.59, P = 0.043) were the independent factors correlated to serum WFA+-M2BP level. The optimal cutoff values of WFA+-M2BP for fibrosis stages F1, F2, F3, and F4 were 1.42, 1.61, 1.42, and 2.67, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the platelet count (OR/CI: -0.009/0.986-0.996, P = <0.001), r-glutamyl transferase (OR/CI: 0.007/1.000-1.013, P = 0.036), and WFA+-M2BP (OR/CI: 0.187/1.057-1.374, P = 0.005).

      "# Title: Comparison of serum fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B.\n# Abstract: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The diagnosis of liver fibrosis has a key role in selecting patients with CHB for antiviral treatment. However, serum biomarkers demonstrate limited diagnostic utility. The present study aimed to compare the performances of fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB and to identify the most appropriate biomarker for these patients. The current study included 96 antiviral-naïve patients with CHB who underwent liver biopsy. METAVIR scoring system was used to assess liver fibrosis and necroinflammation. The diagnostic performances were evaluated of the platelet (PLT) count; the levels of hyaluronan, serum 7S domain of type 4 collagen, procollagen type III N-terminal peptide, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1, Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) and N-terminal type III collagen propeptide (Pro-C3); the fibrosis index based on four factors; the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index; and enhanced liver fibrosis score for identifying significant liver fibrosis [≥fibrosis stage 2 (F2)]. All fibrosis biomarkers, except the Pro-C3 level, correlated with the fibrosis stage. M2BPGi was better than other biomarkers for diagnosing ≥F2, with the highest area under the curve of 0.902. M2BPGi demonstrated a higher diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis than mild/severe fibrosis or cirrhosis. However, no significant correlation was observed between the M2BPGi level and fibrosis stage in patients with CHB having significant liver necroinflammation defined as ≥ necroinflammatory activity 2. The M2BPGi level and PLT count were exclusively correlated with the fibrosis stage in 73 patients without significant liver necroinflammation. M2BPGi demonstrated the highest diagnostic performance for significant fibrosis in patients having significant liver fibrosis with no significant liver necroinflammation. In conclusion, the M2BPGi level can accurately diagnose significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB.",

This study evaluated the performance of WFA+ -M2BP in predicting fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. A total of 80 patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) were enrolled. Serum WFA+ -M2BP levels were measured using standard methods. The fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index was also measured. The mean values of WFA+ -M2BP were 1.0, 1.0, 0.8, and 2.2 in Metavir fibrosis stage F0, F1, F2, and F3-4, respectively (linear trend p = 0.005). The optimal cut-off value of WFA+ -M2BP in predicting advanced fibrosis (F3-4) was 1.37 cut-off index (COI), yielding the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, and accuracy of 75.0, 79.4, 39.1, 94.7, and 78.7%, respectively (p < 0.001). Combining WFA+ -M2BP with FIB-4 significantly increased the diagnostic performance for advanced fibrosis, yielding specificity, PPV, and accuracy of 100, 100, and 93%, respectively. The significant factors predicting advanced liver fibrosis in the multivariate regression analysis were WFA+ -M2BP ≥ 1.37 COI (OR/confidence interval [CI]: 9.49/1.63-55.21, p = 0.01) and FIB-4 ≥ 2.80 (OR/CI: 38.18/4.89-297.93, p = 0.001).

      "# Title: Use of over-the-scope clips (OTSC) for hemostasis in gastrointestinal bleeding in patients under antithrombotic therapy.\n# Abstract: Background and study aims In patients taking different regimens of antithrombotic and/or anticoagulant therapy, endoscopic management of gastrointestinal bleeding represents a major challenge due to failing endogenous hemostasis. In this retrospective study we report on success rates with the over-the-scope clip (OTSC) system in upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding in this high-risk patient population. Patients and methods Between February 2011 and June 2014, 75 patients were treated with an OTSC for active gastrointestinal bleeding. Success rates with the first endoscopic therapy, rebleeding episodes, their management and the influence of antithrombotic or anticoagulant therapy were analyzed retrospectively. Results Application of the OTSC resulted in immediate hemostasis (primary success rate) in all 75 patients. However, in 34.7 % a rebleeding episode was noted that could be treated by further endoscopic interventions. Only 3 patients had to be sent to the operating room because of failure of endoscopic therapy. In the rebleeding group the use of antiplatelet therapies was higher (73.1 % vs. 48.9 %). Conclusions Application of the OTSC in GI bleeding results in a high rate of primary hemostasis. Rebleeding occurs in up to 35 % of patients receiving antithrombotic/anticoagulant therapy but can be managed successfully with further endoscopic treatments. Patients in the rebleeding group were more frequently treated with antiplatelet agents. Radiological or surgical therapy was reserved for a small subgroup not successfully managed by repeated endoscopic therapies. OTSC application is the treatment of choice in high-risk patients when conventional clips used as first-line treatment fail.",

The over-the-scope clip (OTSC) may overcome limitations of standard clips or thermocoagulation in high-risk bleeding lesions. We evaluate the main clinically relevant outcomes following endoscopic hemostasis with OTSC in high-risk lesions and/or patients. Patients and methods  This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected databases including all patients with UGIB and LGIB who underwent OTCS placement as first-line treatment in eleven tertiary endoscopic referral centers. Technical success, primary hemostasis, rebleeding, blood transfusion, hospital stay, and hemorrhage-related mortality rates were evaluated. Results  Data from 286 patients, with either UGIB (N = 214) or LGIB (N = 72) were available. Overall, 112 patients (39.2 %) were receiving antithrombotic therapy. Technical success and primary hemostasis rates were 97.9 % and 96.4 %, respectively. Early rebleeding occurred in 4.4 %, more frequently in those on antithrombotic therapy, and no late rebleeding was observed. Following a successful primary haemostasis, only 5.2 % patients needed blood transfusions, and the median hospital stay was 4 days (range: 3 - 11). Eighteen patients with either technical failure (N = 6) or rebleeding (N = 12) underwent radiological or surgical approaches. Overall, bleeding-related deaths occurred in 5 (1.7 %) patients, including 3 patients with technical procedural failure, and 2 in the rebleeding group.  Conclusions  Data from our large, multicenter study show that OTSC placement is an effective first-line treatment for hemostasis in high-risk patients and/or lesions both in upper and lower gastrointestinal tract.",

Patients and methods  Data on endoscopic treatment (first- vs. second-line) in PUB with OTSC and clinical data were analyzed. The primary outcome was the clinical success of hemostasis, defined as the absence of recurrent bleeding or further intervention. Secondary outcomes were factors associated with OTSC failure. Results  From April 2014 to March 2018, 100 patients (age 72 [20 - 98] y, female 36 %) with PUB in the stomach or the duodenum were treated endoscopically with the OTSC. The OTSC was used as a first-line procedure (primary-OTSC) in 66 pts. Successful hemostasis could be achieved in 90.9 %. After failure of an initial endoscopic treatment, 34 patients were treated with the OTSC (secondary-OTSC) and the treatment was successful in 94.1 %. Recurrent bleeding occurred in n = 10 for primary-OTSC (16.7 %) and in n = 7 pts in the secondary-OTSC (21.9 %) ( P  = 0.81). Clinical success in the primary-OTSC was 75.8 % and 73.5 % in the secondary-OTSC respectively. Conclusions  The OTSC has a high rate of initial bleeding control in first- and second line treatment of PUB. OTSC failure occurs more often in the duodenum than in the stomach and results in longer intensive care unit stay, higher amount of transfusions, and a higher reimbursement per case."

We examined WFA+ -M2BP levels in patients with F4 (cirrhosis), F3 or more (advanced fibrosis) and F2 or more (significant fibrosis) in the two groups. We further examined the relationship between five fibrosis markers and the degree of fibrosis. The WFA+ -M2BP values ranged from 0.25 cut-off index (COI) to 12.9 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 0.34-20.0 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P<.0001). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F4 in the two groups were 2.83 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 5.03 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P=.0046). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F3 or more in the two groups were 1.79 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 3.79 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P<.0001). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F2 or more in the two groups were 1.49 COI in the hepatitis B cohort and 3.19 COI in the hepatitis C group (P<.0001). Among five liver fibrosis markers, WFA+ -M2BP had the highest correlation coefficient (rs =.629) in terms of correlation with the degree of fibrosis in the patients with hepatitis C and had the second highest rs value (.415) in the hepatitis B group. Although WFA+ -M2BP could be a useful indicator of liver fibrosis, WFA+ -M2BP levels in the two groups significantly differed even in the same degree of fibrosis. Individual cut-off values in each aetiology for the degree of fibrosis should be determined.",

Consecutive adult NAFLD patients who had a liver biopsy were included. Serum WFA+-M2BP level was measured using a lectin-antibody sandwich immunoassay using a chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay machine (HISCL-5000, Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). The measured levels were indexed using the following equation: Cut-off index (COI) = ([WFA+-M2BP]sample-[WFA+-M2BP]NC) / ([WFA+-M2BP]PC-[WFA+-M2BP]NC), where PC = positive control and NC = negative control. Histopathological examination of liver biopsy specimen was reported according to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Clinical Research Network Scoring System. Data for 220 cases were analyzed. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of NASH was 0.65. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of steatosis grade ≥2 and 3 was 0.64 and 0.53, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of lobular inflammation grade ≥1, ≥2 and 3 was 0.57, 0.68 and 0.59, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of hepatocyte ballooning grade ≥1 and 2 was 0.64 and 0.65, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of fibrosis stage ≥1, ≥2, ≥3 and 4 was 0.61, 0.71, 0.74 and 0.84, respectively. Out of the 220 cases, 152 cases were the same 76 patients who had a repeat liver biopsy after 48 weeks of intervention. The AUROC of the change in the COI to detect improvement in steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning and fibrosis was 0.57, 0.54, 0.59 and 0.52, respectively. In conclusion, serum WFA+-M2BP was most useful for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in NAFLD patients. However, it was less useful for differentiating NASH from non-NASH, and for diagnosis and follow-up of the individual histopathological components of NASH.",
      "# Title: Serum Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2-binding protein expression predicts disease severity in chronic hepatitis C patients.\n# Abstract: Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein (WFA+-M2BP) has recently been developed as a promising liver fibrosis glyco biomarker. We assessed its efficacy in evaluating liver disease severity in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in Taiwan. The association between WFA+-M2BP and histological features was evaluated among those CHC patients underwent liver biopsy. We also aimed to clarify the factors determining the performance of WFA+-M2BP in CHC. A total of 229 CHC patients were consecutively recruited. The mean value of WFA+-M2BP in patients from F0 to F4 was 1.68, 2.23, 3.45, 3.48, 3.77 respectively (linear trend P = 0.008). Linear regression analysis revealed that alanine aminotransferase (odds ratio [OR]: 0.03, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.02-0.05, P < 0.001), AST (OR: -0.1, 95% CI: -0.02 to -0.01, P < 0.001), and liver fibrosis (OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.01-0.59, P = 0.043) were the independent factors correlated to serum WFA+-M2BP level. The optimal cutoff values of WFA+-M2BP for fibrosis stages F1, F2, F3, and F4 were 1.42, 1.61, 1.42, and 2.67, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the platelet count (OR/CI: -0.009/0.986-0.996, P = <0.001), r-glutamyl transferase (OR/CI: 0.007/1.000-1.013, P = 0.036), and WFA+-M2BP (OR/CI: 0.187/1.057-1.374, P = 0.005).

      "# Title: Comparison of serum fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B.\n# Abstract: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The diagnosis of liver fibrosis has a key role in selecting patients with CHB for antiviral treatment. However, serum biomarkers demonstrate limited diagnostic utility. The present study aimed to compare the performances of fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB and to identify the most appropriate biomarker for these patients. The current study included 96 antiviral-naïve patients with CHB who underwent liver biopsy. METAVIR scoring system was used to assess liver fibrosis and necroinflammation. The diagnostic performances were evaluated of the platelet (PLT) count; the levels of hyaluronan, serum 7S domain of type 4 collagen, procollagen type III N-terminal peptide, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1, Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) and N-terminal type III collagen propeptide (Pro-C3); the fibrosis index based on four factors; the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index; and enhanced liver fibrosis score for identifying significant liver fibrosis [≥fibrosis stage 2 (F2)]. All fibrosis biomarkers, except the Pro-C3 level, correlated with the fibrosis stage. M2BPGi was better than other biomarkers for diagnosing ≥F2, with the highest area under the curve of 0.902. M2BPGi demonstrated a higher diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis than mild/severe fibrosis or cirrhosis. However, no significant correlation was observed between the M2BPGi level and fibrosis stage in patients with CHB having significant liver necroinflammation defined as ≥ necroinflammatory activity 2. The M2BPGi level and PLT count were exclusively correlated with the fibrosis stage in 73 patients without significant liver necroinflammation. M2BPGi demonstrated the highest diagnostic performance for significant fibrosis in patients having significant liver fibrosis with no significant liver necroinflammation. In conclusion, the M2BPGi level can accurately diagnose significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB.",

This study evaluated the performance of WFA+ -M2BP in predicting fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. A total of 80 patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) were enrolled. Serum WFA+ -M2BP levels were measured using standard methods. The fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index was also measured. The mean values of WFA+ -M2BP were 1.0, 1.0, 0.8, and 2.2 in Metavir fibrosis stage F0, F1, F2, and F3-4, respectively (linear trend p = 0.005). The optimal cut-off value of WFA+ -M2BP in predicting advanced fibrosis (F3-4) was 1.37 cut-off index (COI), yielding the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, and accuracy of 75.0, 79.4, 39.1, 94.7, and 78.7%, respectively (p < 0.001). Combining WFA+ -M2BP with FIB-4 significantly increased the diagnostic performance for advanced fibrosis, yielding specificity, PPV, and accuracy of 100, 100, and 93%, respectively. The significant factors predicting advanced liver fibrosis in the multivariate regression analysis were WFA+ -M2BP ≥ 1.37 COI (OR/confidence interval [CI]: 9.49/1.63-55.21, p = 0.01) and FIB-4 ≥ 2.80 (OR/CI: 38.18/4.89-297.93, p = 0.001).

      "# Title: Symptoms and risk factors for long COVID in non-hospitalized adults.\n# Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is associated with a range of persistent symptoms impacting everyday functioning, known as post-COVID-19 condition or long COVID. We undertook a retrospective matched cohort study using a UK-based primary care database, Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum, to determine symptoms that are associated with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection beyond 12 weeks in non-hospitalized adults and the risk factors associated with developing persistent symptoms. We selected 486,149 adults with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 1,944,580 propensity score-matched adults with no recorded evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Outcomes included 115 individual symptoms, as well as long COVID, defined as a composite outcome of 33 symptoms by the World Health Organization clinical case definition. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for the outcomes. A total of 62 symptoms were significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection after 12 weeks. The largest aHRs were for anosmia (aHR 6.49, 95% CI 5.02-8.39), hair loss (3.99, 3.63-4.39), sneezing (2.77, 1.40-5.50), ejaculation difficulty (2.63, 1.61-4.28) and reduced libido (2.36, 1.61-3.47). Among the cohort of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, risk factors for long COVID included female sex, belonging to an ethnic minority, socioeconomic deprivation, smoking, obesity and a wide range of comorbidities. The risk of developing long COVID was also found to be increased along a gradient of decreasing age. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a plethora of symptoms that are associated with a range of sociodemographic and clinical risk factors."

Our study evaluates the safety of appendectomy performed with SDD in pediatric patients when compared to appendectomy followed by an overnight stay, using a large nationwide database and a strict definition of SDD by using hospital length of stay (LOS). Methods: Using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric (NSQIP-P) registry, we identified patients younger than 18 years of age who underwent outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy, with SDD (n = 2647) or overnight stay (n = 5045). One-to-one propensity score matching was performed to compare 30-day readmission rates and postsurgical complications. Results: Non-Hispanic black race was associated with a higher likelihood of overnight stay after laparoscopic appendectomy. In the propensity score-matched analysis (N = 2443 pairs), SDD was not associated with an increased risk of 30-day unplanned readmission (odds ratio [OR] = 0.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.6-1.4; P = .667) or any 30-day complication (OR = 0.8, 95% CI: 0.6-1.1; P = .258). Conclusion: SDD after laparoscopic appendectomy in pediatric patients was not associated with an increased risk of 30-day hospital admission or complication rate.

The aim was to understand the impact of endometriosis on implantation, pregnancy and live birth rates in menopausal recipients. A total of 240 menopausal recipients of donated sibling oocytes, were divided in two groups. Group I consisted of 120 recipients diagnosed with endometriosis and group II consisted of 120 controls. The implantation and pregnancy rates were significantly lower in the endometriosis group compared with the control group (23.81% versus 31.48%, P=0.019; 45.00% versus 58.33%, P=0.039, respectively). In oocyte donation cycles, a recipient's history of endometriosis might have a negative impact on implantation, pregnancy and live birth rates, even in menopausal women. Infertility in endometriosis may be due to poor oocyte quality or embryos with decreased ability to implant due to impaired fertilization. There are no conclusive data on the impact of endometriosis on implantation.

We examined WFA+ -M2BP levels in patients with F4 (cirrhosis), F3 or more (advanced fibrosis) and F2 or more (significant fibrosis) in the two groups. We further examined the relationship between five fibrosis markers and the degree of fibrosis. The WFA+ -M2BP values ranged from 0.25 cut-off index (COI) to 12.9 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 0.34-20.0 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P<.0001). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F4 in the two groups were 2.83 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 5.03 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P=.0046).

Consecutive adult NAFLD patients who had a liver biopsy were included. Serum WFA+-M2BP level was measured using a lectin-antibody sandwich immunoassay using a chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay machine (HISCL-5000, Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). The measured levels were indexed using the following equation: Cut-off index (COI) = ([WFA+-M2BP]sample-[WFA+-M2BP]NC) / ([WFA+-M2BP]PC-[WFA+-M2BP]NC), where PC = positive control and NC = negative control. Histopathological examination of liver biopsy specimen was reported according to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Clinical Research Network Scoring System. Data for 220 cases were analyzed. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of NASH was 0.65. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of steatosis grade ≥2 and 3 was 0.64 and 0.53, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of lobular inflammation grade ≥1, ≥2 and 3 was 0.57, 0.68 and 0.59, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of hepatocyte ballooning grade ≥1 and 2 was 0.64 and 0.65, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of fibrosis stage ≥1, ≥2, ≥3 and 4 was 0.61, 0.71, 0.74 and 0.84, respectively. Out of the 220 cases, 152 cases were the same 76 patients who had a repeat liver biopsy after 48 weeks of intervention. The AUROC of the change in the COI to detect improvement in steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning and fibrosis was 0.57, 0.54, 0.59 and 0.52, respectively. In conclusion, serum WFA+-M2BP was most useful for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in NAFLD patients. However, it was less useful for differentiating NASH from non-NASH, and for diagnosis and follow-up of the individual histopathological components of NASH.",

We assessed its efficacy in evaluating liver disease severity in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in Taiwan. The association between WFA+-M2BP and histological features was evaluated among those CHC patients underwent liver biopsy. We also aimed to clarify the factors determining the performance of WFA+-M2BP in CHC. A total of 229 CHC patients were consecutively recruited. The mean value of WFA+-M2BP in patients from F0 to F4 was 1.68, 2.23, 3.45, 3.48, 3.77 respectively (linear trend P = 0.008). Linear regression analysis revealed that alanine aminotransferase (odds ratio [OR]: 0.03, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.02-0.05, P < 0.001), AST (OR: -0.1, 95% CI: -0.02 to -0.01, P < 0.001), and liver fibrosis (OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.01-0.59, P = 0.043) were the independent factors correlated to serum WFA+-M2BP level. The optimal cutoff values of WFA+-M2BP for fibrosis stages F1, F2, F3, and F4 were 1.42, 1.61, 1.42, and 2.67, respectively.

The diagnosis of liver fibrosis has a key role in selecting patients with CHB for antiviral treatment. However, serum biomarkers demonstrate limited diagnostic utility. The present study aimed to compare the performances of fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB and to identify the most appropriate biomarker for these patients. The current study included 96 antiviral-naïve patients with CHB who underwent liver biopsy. METAVIR scoring system was used to assess liver fibrosis and necroinflammation. The diagnostic performances were evaluated of the platelet (PLT) count; the levels of hyaluronan, serum 7S domain of type 4 collagen, procollagen type III N-terminal peptide, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1, Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) and N-terminal type III collagen propeptide (Pro-C3); the fibrosis index based on four factors; the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index; and enhanced liver fibrosis score for identifying significant liver fibrosis [≥fibrosis stage 2 (F2)]. All fibrosis biomarkers, except the Pro-C3 level, correlated with the fibrosis stage. M2BPGi was better than other biomarkers for diagnosing ≥F2, with the highest area under the curve of 0.902. M2BPGi demonstrated a higher diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis than mild/severe fibrosis or cirrhosis. However, no significant correlation was observed between the M2BPGi level and fibrosis stage in patients with CHB having significant liver necroinflammation defined as ≥ necroinflammatory activity 2. The M2BPGi level and PLT count were exclusively correlated with the fibrosis stage in 73 patients without significant liver necroinflammation. M2BPGi demonstrated the highest diagnostic performance for significant fibrosis in patients having significant liver fibrosis with no significant liver necroinflammation. In conclusion, the M2BPGi level can accurately diagnose significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB.",

This study evaluated the performance of WFA+ -M2BP in predicting fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. A total of 80 patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) were enrolled. Serum WFA+ -M2BP levels were measured using standard methods. The fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index was also measured. The mean values of WFA+ -M2BP were 1.0, 1.0, 0.8, and 2.2 in Metavir fibrosis stage F0, F1, F2, and F3-4, respectively (linear trend p = 0.005). The optimal cut-off value of WFA+ -M2BP in predicting advanced fibrosis (F3-4) was 1.37 cut-off index (COI), yielding the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, and accuracy of 75.0, 79.4, 39.1, 94.7, and 78.7%, respectively (p < 0.001). Combining WFA+ -M2BP with FIB-4 significantly increased the diagnostic performance for advanced fibrosis, yielding specificity, PPV, and accuracy of 100, 100, and 93%, respectively. The significant factors predicting advanced liver fibrosis in the multivariate regression analysis were WFA+ -M2BP ≥ 1.37 COI (OR/confidence interval [CI]: 9.49/1.63-55.21, p = 0.01) and FIB-4 ≥ 2.80 (OR/CI: 38.18/4.89-297.93, p = 0.001).

This procedure restores rotational stability, leading to good clinical results, optimal functional outcomes, and great patient satisfaction. Most patients returned to their pre-injury level of sport at a mean of 6 months. LET ACL reconstruction may be associated with greater clinical outcomes, but, on the other hand, it could be associated with a higher reoperation rate compared to ALL reconstruction.",

      "# Title: Prospective and randomized evaluation of ACL reconstruction with three techniques: a clinical and radiographic evaluation at 5 years follow-up.\n# Abstract: A variety of graft sources have been used for ACL reconstruction to improve functions and kinematics in ACL deficient knees. The two most commonly used autogenous grafts are the central third of the patellar tendon and the hamstring tendon constructs. The choice of different grafts and different construct influence the final clinical outcome of ACL reconstruction. The 3 groups, of 25 patients each, were generated by choosing the technique (PT tendon, 4 strand hamstring, and single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty) to utilize and followed for 5 years, with an alternate systematic sampling. Our comparison has shown significant kneeling pain in the patellar tendon with respect to the groups with hamstrings techniques. Single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty achieved subjective score significantly higher with respect to the other two groups as well as for the time to resume sport. The study confirms that patellar tendon and hamstring can be equivalent options for ACL reconstruction. This study demonstrated that a superior outcome as far as subjective clinical findings were concerned, was obtained in group III. Patients in the latter group were also able to return to sports sooner than those in the bone-patellar tendon graft group and the four-strand hamstring group.",
      "# Title: ST/G ACL reconstruction: double strand plus extra-articular sling vs double bundle, randomized study at 3-year follow-up.\n# Abstract: Several investigators have reported the presence of biomechanical, kinematic, anatomic, fiber orientation patterns and biological differences between the anteromedial bundle and the posterolateral bundle of ACL. The purpose of this prospective randomized study was to compare the clinical, instrumental and X-ray outcome of two ACL reconstruction techniques with hamstring tendons: one with a single intra-articular bundle associated to an extra-articular sling, the second with a more anatomic double-bundle technique that reproduces better the native ACL function. From an initial group of 100 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction, 72 patients (35 single bundle plus lateral plasty and 37 double bundle) were evaluated with IKDC, Tegner score, KT2000 arthrometer, Activity Rating Scale, Psychovitality Questionnaire and Ahlback radiographic score at a mean 3 years follow-up. Double-bundle group showed significantly better results regarding IKDC, ROM, Activity Rating Scale and time to return to sport. Also KT 2000 showed significant differences in objective stability. The double-bundle technique for ACL reconstruction described in this paper has demonstrated significantly better subjective, objective and functional results compared with a double-stranded hamstrings plus extra-articular sling at a minimum 3-year follow-up.",

      "# Title: A medium to long-term follow-up of ACL reconstruction using double gracilis and semitendinosus grafts.\n# Abstract: This paper reports the results of our approach to ACL tears and knee laxity, based on 30 years of experience in ACL reconstruction with hamstrings and founded on the following cornerstones: the use of doubled semitendinosus and gracilis as a free graft; the use of an out-in technique for femoral drilling and of very strong and stiff fixation devices; the careful examination and repair or reconstruction of the lateral compartment in selected patients; and the use of unaggressive rehabilitation. We prospectively evaluated a series of 100 consecutive patients who underwent ACL reconstruction between 2001 and 2002. A clinical and radiological follow-up was performed at a minimum of 6 years. After 6 years, the International Knee Documentation Committee score demonstrated good-to-excellent results (A and B) in 98% of patients. However, arthrometric results using the KT-1000 demonstrated that 6/80 patients (7.5%) had >5 mm manual maximum side-to-side difference. The median Tegner activity score was 5 (range 1-9); the median Lysholm score was 96 (range 81-100); and the median subjective IKDC score was 94 (range 66-100). We reported 6/80 failures as revealed by a 2+ or 3+ pivot-shift test result and/or KT-1000 side-to-side difference of more than 5 mm. The IKDC score revealed excellent results in all women who underwent extra-articular tenodesis. Radiographic evaluation demonstrated early signs of osteoarthritis in 9% of patients.",

      "# Title: Addition of anterolateral ligament reconstruction to primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction could benefit recovery of functional outcomes.\n# Abstract: This study aimed to compare functional outcomes sequentially up to 1 year after combined anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR) and isolated ACLR. Fifty patients who underwent ACLR with versus without ALLR were analyzed at four different time points (preoperatively and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively). For the functional outcomes, muscle strength and acceleration time (AT) were measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. Proprioception was evaluated using joint position sense and dynamic postural stability. Patient-reported outcomes were measured using the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK-11) scores. Functional performance was assessed using single-leg hop distance (SLHD) and Limb Symmetry Index. In the operated knees, quadriceps (at 6 months postoperatively, p = 0.003) and hamstring (at 6 and 12 months postoperatively, p < 0.001) strength were significantly higher in the combined ACLR and ALLR group than the isolated ACLR group. The TSK-11 (at 6 and 12 months postoperatively, p < 0.001) was significantly lower in the combined ACLR and ALLR group than the isolated ACLR group. SLHD was significantly higher in the combined ACLR and ALLR group than the isolated ACLR group (at 6 months, p = 0.022 and at 12 months, p = 0.024). The addition of ALLR to primary ACLR yielded better muscle performance, fear of movement, and functional performance than isolated ACLR."

Data on outcomes in patients with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for CTO, however, are scarce. A total of 2,002 consecutive patients undergoing PCI for CTO from January 2005 to December 2013 were divided into patients with and without previous CABG, and outcomes were retrospectively assessed. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality. Median follow-up was 2.6 years (interquartile range 1.1 to 3.1). A total of 292 patients (15%) had previous CABG; they were older and had a greater prevalence of comorbidities. Procedural success was achieved in 75% and 84% of patients in the previous CABG and the non-CABG groups (p <0.001), respectively. All-cause mortality was 16% and 11% in the previous CABG and the non-CABG groups (p = 0.002), and differences were mitigated after adjustment for baseline characteristics (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86 to 1.74, p = 0.27).

Our objective was to determine if mFI predicts morbidity and mortality in the diverse national cohort of patients undergoing neurosurgery for intracranial neoplasms. We identified patients in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program who underwent oncologic neurosurgery procedures between 2008 and 2012. The mFI, ranging from 0 to 1, was calculated as the proportion of 11 possible risk factors present. We assessed the associations between mFI and 30-day mortality, neurologic and medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge in univariate and multivariable analyses and compare the index to established risk stratification techniques. A total of 9149 patients were identified. Mortality, severe medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge increased incrementally with increasing levels of frailty. Severe neurologic complications were highest in those with low frailty. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, increased frailty increased the odds of all adverse outcomes, including neurologic complications. The mFI increased the ability to predict all outcomes beyond available indices and was the most reliable predictor of neurologic complications. The mFI can be calculated from routinely collected medical record data and is predictive of 30-day adverse outcomes in a wide variety of neurosurgical oncology patients. The index may be a useful component of preoperative risk assessment with implications for shared decision-making, perioperative planning, and risk adjusted outcomes measurement in national quality registries.",

Few data exist regarding the relationship of frailty with adverse outcomes in craniotomy for brain tumor resection. We assessed the relationship between frailty and the incidence of major post-operative complication, discharge destination other than home, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality after elective craniotomy for brain tumor resection. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 20,333 adult patients undergoing elective craniotomy for tumor resection in the 2012-2018 ACS-NSQIP Participant Use File. Multivariate logistic regression was performed using all covariates deemed eligible through clinical and statistical significance. 6,249 patients (30.7%) were low-frailty and 2,148 patients (10.6%) were medium-to-high frailty. In multivariate logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, BMI, ASA classification, smoking status, dyspnea, significant pre-operative weight loss, chronic steroid use, bleeding disorder, tumor type, and operative time, low frailty was associated with increased adjusted odds ratio of major complication (1.41, 95% CI: 1.23-1.60, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.32, 95% CI: 1.20-1.46, p < 0.001), 30-day readmission (1.29, 95% CI: 1.15-1.44, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (1.87, 95% CI: 1.41-2.47, p < 0.001). Moderate-to-high frailty was also associated with increased adjusted odds of major complication (1.61, 95% CI: 1.35-1.92, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.80, 95% CI: 1.58-2.05), 30-day readmission (1.39, 95% CI: 1.19-1.62, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (2.42, 95% CI: 1.74-3.38, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is associated with increased odds of major post-operative complication, discharge to destination other than home, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality.",

Our study evaluates the safety of appendectomy performed with SDD in pediatric patients when compared to appendectomy followed by an overnight stay, using a large nationwide database and a strict definition of SDD by using hospital length of stay (LOS). Methods: Using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric (NSQIP-P) registry, we identified patients younger than 18 years of age who underwent outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy, with SDD (n = 2647) or overnight stay (n = 5045). One-to-one propensity score matching was performed to compare 30-day readmission rates and postsurgical complications. Results: Non-Hispanic black race was associated with a higher likelihood of overnight stay after laparoscopic appendectomy. In the propensity score-matched analysis (N = 2443 pairs), SDD was not associated with an increased risk of 30-day unplanned readmission (odds ratio [OR] = 0.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.6-1.4; P = .667) or any 30-day complication (OR = 0.8, 95% CI: 0.6-1.1; P = .258). Conclusion: SDD after laparoscopic appendectomy in pediatric patients was not associated with an increased risk of 30-day hospital admission or complication rate.

    "referenceConclusion": "High PM 2.5 exposure is one of the most important avoidable hazards to human health. The effects on hematological systems have been less well-studied. There were fewer than 20 available entries in the web search according to the Cochrane recommendation as the damages are not easily analyzed and are mostly unnoticed. All available studies found harmful effects of long-term exposure to PM 2.5 to the hematopoietic system. Hematological parameter changes in people exposed to medium to high PM 2.5 concentrations for more than a year are summarized in Table 2 . The pathophysiology of PM 2.5 pollution may be from increased inflammatory responses affecting each hematological component. For the public, avoidance of exposure and reduction in PM 2.5 pollution should be encouraged. Interventions should be focused on the high-risk groups including the elderly with cardiovascular diseases, young children, and pregnant women. Personal facemasks can minimize inhaled small particles and reduce pollution exposure time. Air purifiers also lessen indoor pollution concentrations. Improving air quality has to be addressed for the general population. Decreasing PM 2.5 pollution is essential to prevent hematological adverse events. Further studies are needed to determine whether reducing PM 2.5 exposure can decrease these disorders. Pathophysiology of PM 2.5 effects on individual hematologic parameters and the high-risk groups. High PM 2.5 : A 24-h mean level between 25 and 50 μg/m 3 or annual mean over 10 μg/m 3 . Very high PM 2.5 : A 24-h mean level over 50 μg/m 3 .",

      "# Title: Particulate matter air pollution and cardiovascular disease: An update to the scientific statement from the American Heart Association.\n# Abstract: In 2004, the first American Heart Association scientific statement on \"Air Pollution and Cardiovascular Disease\" concluded that exposure to particulate matter (PM) air pollution contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In the interim, numerous studies have expanded our understanding of this association and further elucidated the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved. The main objective of this updated American Heart Association scientific statement is to provide a comprehensive review of the new evidence linking PM exposure with cardiovascular disease, with a specific focus on highlighting the clinical implications for researchers and healthcare providers. The writing group also sought to provide expert consensus opinions on many aspects of the current state of science and updated suggestions for areas of future research. On the basis of the findings of this review, several new conclusions were reached, including the following: Exposure to PM <2.5 microm in diameter (PM(2.5)) over a few hours to weeks can trigger cardiovascular disease-related mortality and nonfatal events; longer-term exposure (eg, a few years) increases the risk for cardiovascular mortality to an even greater extent than exposures over a few days and reduces life expectancy within more highly exposed segments of the population by several months to a few years; reductions in PM levels are associated with decreases in cardiovascular mortality within a time frame as short as a few years; and many credible pathological mechanisms have been elucidated that lend biological plausibility to these findings. It is the opinion of the writing group that the overall evidence is consistent with a causal relationship between PM(2.5) exposure and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This body of evidence has grown and been strengthened substantially since the first American Heart Association scientific statement was published. Finally, PM(2.5) exposure is deemed a modifiable factor that contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.",

      "# Title: Effects of particulate matter exposure on blood 5-hydroxymethylation: results from the Beijing truck driver air pollution study.\n# Abstract: Previous studies have reported epigenetic changes induced by environmental exposures. However, previous investigations did not distinguish 5-methylcytosine (5mC) from a similar oxidative form with opposite functions, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Here, we measured blood DNA global 5mC and 5hmC by ELISA and used adjusted mixed-effects regression models to evaluate the effects of ambient PM10 and personal PM2.5 and its elemental components-black carbon (BC), aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), iron (Fe), sulfur (S), silicon (Si), titanium (Ti), and zinc (Zn)-on blood global 5mC and 5hmC levels. The study was conducted in 60 truck drivers and 60 office workers in Beijing, China from The Beijing Truck Driver Air Pollution Study at 2 exams separated by one to 2 weeks. Blood 5hmC level (0.08%) was ∼83-fold lower than 5mC (6.61%). An inter-quartile range (IQR) increase in same-day PM10 was associated with increases in 5hmC of 26.1% in office workers (P = 0.004), 20.2% in truck drivers (P = 0.014), and 21.9% in all participants combined (P < 0.001). PM10 effects on 5hmC were increasingly stronger when averaged over 4, 7, and 14 d preceding assessment (up to 132.6% for the 14-d average in all participants, P < 0.001). PM10 effects were also significant after controlling for multiple testing (family-wise error rate; FWER < 0.05). 5hmC was not correlated with personal measures of PM2.5 and elemental components (FWER > 0.05). 5mC showed no correlations with PM10, PM2.5, and elemental components measures (FWER > 0.05). Our study suggests that exposure to ambient PM10 affects 5hmC over time, but not 5mC. This finding demonstrates the need to differentiate 5hmC and 5mC in environmental studies of DNA methylation.",

PM2.5 was declared by IARC a Class I carcinogen. No report has focused on particulate environmental pollution together with AML. The study investigated the presence and composition of particulate matter in blood with a Scanning Electron Microscope coupled with an Energy Dispersive Spectroscope, a sensor capable of identifying the composition of foreign bodies. 38 peripheral blood samples, 19 AML cases and 19 healthy controls, were analyzed. A significant overload of particulate matter-derived nanoparticles linked or aggregated to blood components was found in AML patients, while almost absent in matched healthy controls. Two-tailed Student's t-test, MANOVA and Principal Component Analysis indicated that the total numbers of aggregates and particles were statistically different between cases and controls (MANOVA, P<0.001 and P=0.009 respectively). The particles detected showed to contain highly-reactive, non-biocompatible and non-biodegradable metals; in particular, micro- and nano-sized particles grouped in organic/inorganic clusters, with statistically higher frequency of a subgroup of elements in AML samples. The demonstration, for the first time, of an overload of nanoparticles linked to blood components in AML patients could be the basis for a possible, novel pathogenetic mechanism for AML development.",

      "# Title: Increased Outdoor PM2.5 Concentration Is Associated with Moderate/Severe Anemia in Children Aged 6-59 Months in Lima, Peru.\n# Abstract: Anemia affects 1.62 billion people worldwide. Although iron deficiency is the main cause of anemia, several other factors may explain its high prevalence. In this study, we sought to analyze the association between outdoor particulate matter PM2.5 levels with anemia prevalence in children aged 6-59 months residing in Lima, Peru (n = 139,368), one of the cities with the worst air pollution in Latin America. The study period was from 2012 to 2016. Anemia was defined according to the World Health Organization (Hb < 11 g/dL). PM2.5 values were estimated by a mathematical model that combined data observed from monitors, with satellite and meteorological data. PM2.5 was analyzed by quintiles. Multiple linear and logistic regressions were used to estimate the associations between hemoglobin concentration (beta) and anemia (odds ratio) with PM2.5, after adjusting by covariates. Prevalence of anemia was 39.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 39.3-39.9). Mild anemia was observed in 30.8% of children and moderate/severe in 8.84% of children. Anemic children compared with nonanemic children are mainly males, have low body weight, higher rate of stunting, and live in an environment with high PM2.5 concentration. A slight decrease in hemoglobin (4Q B: -0.03, 95% CI: -0.05 to -0.02; 5Q B: -0.04, 95% CI: -0.06 to -0.01) and an increase in the probability of moderate/severe anemia (4Q OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.10-1.27; 5Q OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.08-1.29) were observed with increased exposure to PM2.5. We conclude that outdoor PM2.5 levels were significantly associated with decreased hemoglobin values and an increase in prevalence of moderate/severe anemia in children under 5 years old.",

In this nationwide register-based case-control study, we focus on specific components of PM2.5 in relation to childhood NHL in Denmark (1981-2013) by identifying all incidents of childhood NHL cases in the Danish Cancer Registry (n = 170) and four (cancer-free) randomly selected controls matched by date of birth and sex. We applied PM2.5 concentrations and the following sub-components: secondary organic aerosols (SOA), secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA; i.e., NO3-, NH4+ and SO42-), BC, organic carbon (OC) and sea salt. We calculated a time-weighted exposure average from birth to index-date at all addresses. Odds ratios (ORs) were adjusted for register-based socio-demographic variables. We observed adjusted ORs and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of 2.05 (1.10, 3.83) per interquartile range (IQR, 4.83 µg/m3) PM2.5 and 1.73 (0.68, 4.41) per IQR (3.71 µg/m3) SIA, 0.95 (0.71, 1.29) per IQR (0.05 µg/m3) SOA, 1.22 (1.02, 1.46) per IQR (0.39 µg/m3) BC, 1.02 (0.83, 1.26) per IQR (0.56 µg/m3) OC and 1.01 (0.79, 1.30) per IQR (0.87 µg/m3) sea salt, respectively. The estimates were attenuated after adjustment for PM2.5, whereas the OR for PM2.5 remained increased regardless of adjustment for specific components. The findings indicate that the previously observed relation between PM2.5 and childhood NHL may be related to BC (as reported in our previous study) but also partly to SIA, but the role of specific chemical components of PM2.5 remains ambiguous."

This study investigated the usefulness of LSM as a predictor of HCC development in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). A total of 1,130 patients with non-biopsy-proven CHB who underwent LSM between May 2005 and December 2007 were enrolled in this prospective study. After LSM was performed, patients attended regular follow-up as part of a surveillance program for the detection of HCC. The mean age of the patients (767 men, 363 women) was 50.2 years, and the median LSM was 7.7 kPa. Six hundred seventy-two (59.5%) patients received antiviral treatment before or after enrollment. During the follow-up period (median, 30.7 months; range, 24.0-50.9 months), HCC developed in 57 patients (2.0% per 1 person-year). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year cumulative incidence rates of HCC were 0.80%, 3.26%, and 5.98%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, together with old age, male sex, heavy alcohol consumption (>80 g/day), serum albumin, and hepatitis B e antigen positivity, patients with a higher LSM (>8 kPa) were at a significantly greater risk of HCC development, with the following hazard ratios: 3.07 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-9.31; P = 0.047) for LSM 8.1-13 kPa; 4.68 (95% CI, 1.40-15.64; P = 0.012) for LSM 13.1-18 kPa; 5.55 (95% CI, 1.53-20.04; P = 0.009) for LSM 18.1-23 kPa; and 6.60 (95% CI, 1.83-23.84; P = 0.004) for LSM >23 kPa.",

We investigated the efficacy of the ELF test in predicting development of liver-related events (LREs) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). A total of 170 patients (103 men; 60.6%) with CHB who underwent LB and serological tests for determining ELFs were enrolled. All patients were followed up to monitor LRE development, defined as hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and/or liver-related death. The mean age was 45.3 years. During the follow-up period (median, 41 months), 39 (22.9%) patients experienced LREs. In patients with LREs, age, proportion of male gender, ELF test results, age-spleen-platelet ratio (ASPRI), liver stiffness (LS) value, and proportion of histological cirrhosis were significantly higher than those in patients without LREs (all P < 0.05). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves to predict LRE development were 0.808 for the ELF test, 0.732 for LS value, 0.713 for histological fibrosis stages using Batts and Ludwig's scoring system, and 0.687 for ASPRI. On multivariate analysis, along with age, the ELF test was an independent predictor of LRE development (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.438; P < 0.001). When we applied a three-tier stratification of our study population using cut-off ELF values of 8.10 and 10.40, patients with low (P = 0.002; adjusted HR: 0.045; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.006-0.330) and intermediate (P < 0.001; adjusted HR: 0.239; 95% CI: 0.122-0.469) ELF range were found less likely to develop LREs, compared to those with high ELF range.",

Mean age of the study population was 46.1 years, and male gender was predominant (n = 1,775; 61.7%). Mean LS value was 7.9 kPa, and SCC was identified in 285 (9.9%) patients. During the median follow-up period of 48.9 months (range, 6.6-96.2), HCC developed in 16 patients (13.3 per 1,000 person-years) in the SCC group and 36 (3.4 per 1,000 person-years) in the non-SCC group. Cumulative incidence rate of HCC in the SCC group was significantly higher than that in the non-SCC group (P < 0.001, log-rank test). On multivariate analysis, SCC was independently associated with a risk of developing HCC, regardless of antiviral therapy (without antiviral therapy: hazard ratio [HR]: 4.680; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.187-18.441; P = 0.027; with antiviral therapy: HR, 3.344; 95% CI: 1.526-7.328; P = 0.003).",

We investigated whether the combined use of ultrasonography (US) and transient elastography (TE) to diagnose cirrhosis is beneficial for the risk assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver-related events in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). A total of 9300 patients with CHB who underwent US and TE in two institutions between 2006 and 2018 were enrolled. TE value ≥13 kPa was set to indicate cirrhosis. Patients were divided into four groups: US(+)TE(+) (cirrhosis by US and TE), US(+)TE(-) (cirrhosis by US, but not by TE), US(-)TE(+) (cirrhosis by TE, but not by US) and US(-)TE(-) (non-cirrhosis by US and TE).The patients were predominantly male (n = 5474, 58.9%) with a mean age of 47.5 years. The proportions of patients with cirrhosis diagnosed by US and TE were 17.2% (n = 1595) and 13.2% (n = 1225), respectively. The proportion of patients with discordant results in diagnosing cirrhosis by US and TE was 18.7% (n = 1740). During follow-up (median: 60.0 months), HCC and liver-related events developed in 481 (5.2%) and 759 (8.2%) patients, respectively. The cumulative incidence rates of HCC and liver-related events were highest in the US(+)TE(+) group, intermediate-high in the US(-)TE(+) group, intermediate-low in the US(+)TE(-) group and lowest in the US(-)TE(-) group (overall p < .001). Cirrhosis assessed using US and TE was a major predictor of HCC and liver-related event development in patients with CHB. Cirrhosis assessed using TE seemed better in predicting HCC or liver-related events than using US, when cirrhosis diagnosis was discordant by US and TE.",

In this retrospective study we report on success rates with the over-the-scope clip (OTSC) system in upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding in this high-risk patient population. Patients and methods Between February 2011 and June 2014, 75 patients were treated with an OTSC for active gastrointestinal bleeding. Success rates with the first endoscopic therapy, rebleeding episodes, their management and the influence of antithrombotic or anticoagulant therapy were analyzed retrospectively. Results Application of the OTSC resulted in immediate hemostasis (primary success rate) in all 75 patients. However, in 34.7 % a rebleeding episode was noted that could be treated by further endoscopic interventions. Only 3 patients had to be sent to the operating room because of failure of endoscopic therapy. In the rebleeding group the use of antiplatelet therapies was higher (73.1 % vs. 48.9 %). Conclusions Application of the OTSC in GI bleeding results in a high rate of primary hemostasis. Rebleeding occurs in up to 35 % of patients receiving antithrombotic/anticoagulant therapy but can be managed successfully with further endoscopic treatments. Patients in the rebleeding group were more frequently treated with antiplatelet agents.

The over-the-scope clip (OTSC) may overcome limitations of standard clips or thermocoagulation in high-risk bleeding lesions. We evaluate the main clinically relevant outcomes following endoscopic hemostasis with OTSC in high-risk lesions and/or patients. Patients and methods  This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected databases including all patients with UGIB and LGIB who underwent OTCS placement as first-line treatment in eleven tertiary endoscopic referral centers. Technical success, primary hemostasis, rebleeding, blood transfusion, hospital stay, and hemorrhage-related mortality rates were evaluated. Results  Data from 286 patients, with either UGIB (N = 214) or LGIB (N = 72) were available. Overall, 112 patients (39.2 %) were receiving antithrombotic therapy. Technical success and primary hemostasis rates were 97.9 % and 96.4 %, respectively. Early rebleeding occurred in 4.4 %, more frequently in those on antithrombotic therapy, and no late rebleeding was observed. Following a successful primary haemostasis, only 5.2 % patients needed blood transfusions, and the median hospital stay was 4 days (range: 3 - 11). Eighteen patients with either technical failure (N = 6) or rebleeding (N = 12) underwent radiological or surgical approaches.

Patients and methods  Data on endoscopic treatment (first- vs. second-line) in PUB with OTSC and clinical data were analyzed. The primary outcome was the clinical success of hemostasis, defined as the absence of recurrent bleeding or further intervention. Secondary outcomes were factors associated with OTSC failure. Results  From April 2014 to March 2018, 100 patients (age 72 [20 - 98] y, female 36 %) with PUB in the stomach or the duodenum were treated endoscopically with the OTSC. The OTSC was used as a first-line procedure (primary-OTSC) in 66 pts. Successful hemostasis could be achieved in 90.9 %. After failure of an initial endoscopic treatment, 34 patients were treated with the OTSC (secondary-OTSC) and the treatment was successful in 94.1 %. Recurrent bleeding occurred in n = 10 for primary-OTSC (16.7 %) and in n = 7 pts in the secondary-OTSC (21.9 %) ( P  = 0.81). Clinical success in the primary-OTSC was 75.8 % and 73.5 % in the secondary-OTSC respectively. Conclusions  The OTSC has a high rate of initial bleeding control in first- and second line treatment of PUB. OTSC failure occurs more often in the duodenum than in the stomach and results in longer intensive care unit stay, higher amount of transfusions, and a higher reimbursement per case."

The two most commonly used autogenous grafts are the central third of the patellar tendon and the hamstring tendon constructs. The choice of different grafts and different construct influence the final clinical outcome of ACL reconstruction. The 3 groups, of 25 patients each, were generated by choosing the technique (PT tendon, 4 strand hamstring, and single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty) to utilize and followed for 5 years, with an alternate systematic sampling. Our comparison has shown significant kneeling pain in the patellar tendon with respect to the groups with hamstrings techniques. Single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty achieved subjective score significantly higher with respect to the other two groups as well as for the time to resume sport. The study confirms that patellar tendon and hamstring can be equivalent options for ACL reconstruction. This study demonstrated that a superior outcome as far as subjective clinical findings were concerned, was obtained in group III. Patients in the latter group were also able to return to sports sooner than those in the bone-patellar tendon graft group and the four-strand hamstring group.",

      "# Title: Lymph node metastasis is mediated by suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 in gastric cancer.\n# Abstract: Suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3), a multifunctional cytokine, is able to inhibit cell growth and migration by blocking the Janus kinase signal transducers and activators of transcription signaling (JAK/STAT) activation in oncogenesis. Although the STAT-3 expression was associated with lymph node metastasis from gastric cancer (GC), the implication of SOCS-3 expression in GC is not clearly elucidated. In this study, SOCS-3, STAT-3, and pSTAT-3 were evaluated in GC tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues of 107 patients who underwent curative surgery by immunohistochemistry. Further, SOCS-3 and STAT-3 mRNA levels were also detected simultaneously. In addition, survival analysis was performed between clinicopathologic variables and prognosis of GC patients. Finally, correlative analysis was adopted for demonstration the best predicator of the survival independent factor. From the results, we demonstrated that only the lymph node metastasis was the independent predictor of the overall survival (OS) of GC patients, although SOCS-3, STAT-3, and other variables were significantly relative to OS. With multivariate logistical regression analysis, SOCS-3, STAT-3, and the status of extragastric nodal metastasis were identified to be the independent factors of the lymph node metastasis from GC. Ultimately, the SOCS-3 was the best predicator of lymph node metastasis from GC identified with the nominal regression analysis. Therefore, SOCS-3 should be considered as a potential indicator for prediction the lymph node metastasis from GC.",

Although tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3, also known as A20) can decrease SOCS3 expression and is involved in the regulation of tumorigenesis in certain malignancies, its role in CCA remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression of SOCS3 and A20 in human CCA tissues to assess the prognostic significance of these proteins. The expression of SOCS3 and A20 was initially detected by western blot in 22 cases of freshly frozen CCA tumors with corresponding peritumoral tissues and 22 control normal bile duct tissues. Then, these proteins were investigated in 86 CCA patients by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and were evaluated for their association with clinicopathological parameters in human CCA. The results indicated that SOCS3 expression was significantly lower in CCA tumor tissues than in corresponding peritumoral biliary tissues and normal bile duct tissues. Conversely, A20 was overexpressed in CCA tissues. Thus, an inverse correlation between the expression of SOCS3 and A20 was discovered. Furthermore, patients with low SOCS3 expression or high A20 expression showed a dramatically lower overall survival rate. These proteins were both associated with CCA lymph node metastasis, postoperative recurrence and overall survival rate. However, only A20 showed a significant association with the tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage, while SOCS3 showed a significant association with tumor differentiation. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that SOCS3 and A20 were independent prognostic indicators for overall survival in CCA. Thus, our study demonstrated that SOCS3 and A20 represent novel prognostic factors for human CCA.",

      "# Title: The prognostic role of BORIS and SOCS3 in human hepatocellular carcinoma.\n# Abstract: Brother of regulator of imprinted sites (BORIS) is a DNA-binding protein that is normally expressed in the testes. However, aberrant expression of BORIS is observed in various carcinomas, indicating a malignant role for this protein. Furthermore, abolishment or reduction of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) expression directed by promoter methylation is considered significant in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) carcinogenesis. This study aims to investigate BORIS and SOCS3 expression in HCC specimens and assess the prognostic significance of these proteins.BORIS and SOCS3 expression was examined using immunohistochemistry in HCC tissues, along with corresponding paracarcinomatous, cirrhosis, hepatitis, and normal liver tissues. The expression levels of these 2 proteins in HCC were evaluated for their association with clinicopathological parameters. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves, the log-rank test, and multivariate Cox regression analysis.BORIS expression was significantly higher in HCC tissues than in normal liver tissues. In contrast, SOCS3 expression was dramatically lower in HCC tissues. BORIS expression was associated with tumor size, differentiation grade, satellite lesions, and recurrence while SOCS3 expression correlated with differentiation grade, vascular invasion, and recurrence. A significant negative correlation between BORIS and SOCS3 was observed. Patients with high BORIS expression and/or low SOCS3 expression had poorer postoperative survival. Patients with both these characteristics had the poorest prognostic outcome.BORIS and SOCS3 are promising as valuable indicators for predicting HCC prognosis.",

      "# Title: Prognostic significance of SOCS3 and its biological function in colorectal cancer.\n# Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignant tumor, in which the inflammatory microenvironment plays an important role. STAT3 signaling pathway is regarded as the \"bridge\" between inflammation and cancer, and involved in the development of CRC. SOCS3 is a key negative feedback regulator of JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Studies about SOCS3 gene in CRC are rarely reported. The purpose of this study is to determine the expression of SOCS3 in CRC tissue and its correlation with the clinical pathological characteristics and prognosis of colorectal cancers. The effects of SOCS3 on biological behavior such as apoptosis, proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor formation in nude mice were studied. We observed that SOCS3 expression was down-regulated in CRC tissues, while IL-6, pSTAT3 were up-regulated. Inflammatory cytokines IL-6 can promote the expression of STAT3 signaling pathways while inhibit the expression of SOCS3 by promoting hypermethylation of SOCS3 gene promoters. 5-Aza-cdR treatment can reverse IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway mediated down-regulation of SOCS3 in colorectal cancer cells. Low expression of SOCS3 was correlated with lymph node metastasis and advanced clinical stage. Patients with high expression of SOCS3 in colorectal cancers often indicated a relatively good prognosis. Overexpression of SOCS3 inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion and tumorigenic ability of CRC cells while increased cell apoptosis. This study demonstrated that IL-6/STAT3 signaling activation negatively regulated SOCS3 expression, which led to imbalance and sustained activation of STAT3 signaling pathway. Reduced expression of SOCS3 promoted the growth and metastasis of colorectal cancer. Thus, targeting IL-6/STAT3/SOCS3 signaling pathway may become an important treatment strategy of colorectal cancer.",

Methods: We assessed the expression of PD-L1, CD276, SOCS3, CD4 and CD8 by immunohistochemistry in tumor tissue from 74 HCC patients who underwent curative hepatectomy. Results: High expression of PD-L1 was significantly associated with high Edmondson grade (p<0.01) and elevated enzyme (p=0.037); high expression of CD276 was significantly correlated with high Edmondson grade (p=0.021); high expression of SOCS3 was significantly associated with age (p=0.026) and tumor size (p=0.041), while PD-L1 showed no significant correlation. The expression of PD-L1, CD276, SOCS3 protein and other clinicopathological factors (sex, vascular invasion, tumor number, tumor capsule, pT stage, liver cirrhosis, HBsAg, TBiL, AFP) showed no significant correlation (p>0.05). High expression of CD8 was respectively significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS) (p=0.002). There was no significantly difference between CD4 and CD8 high-expression and overall survival (OS) (p=0.100). Both high expression of PD-L1 (p=0.003) and low expression of SOCS3 (p=0.015) was significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS). But CD276 only had a trendency (p=0.166). Additionally, multivariate Cox regression models implied that PD-L1, SOCS3, as well as both CD4 and CD8 was an independent prognostic factor for OS (p<0.05). Furthermore, HCC patients with PD-L1 low-expression and SOCS3 high-expression had a better prognostic according to the different pT stages (p<0.05). Conclusions: We for the first time demonstrated that PD-L1 and SOCS3 were independent prognostic factor for HCC patients. Co-expression of low PD-L1 and high SOCS3 could be a better predictive marker for HCC patients."

This single-center study was conducted to assess the accuracy of SWE in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), in comparison with transient elastography (TE), by using liver biopsy (LB) as the reference standard. Consecutive patients with CHC scheduled for LB by referring physicians were studied. One hundred and twenty-one patients met inclusion criteria. On the same day, real-time SWE using the ultrasound (US) system, Aixplorer (SuperSonic Imagine S.A., Aix-en-Provence, France), TE using FibroScan (Echosens, Paris, France), and US-assisted LB were consecutively performed. Fibrosis was staged according to the METAVIR scoring system.

A total of 1440 measurements were made. Reproducibility was assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and a repeated measures analysis of variance. The shear wave speed was measured and used to estimate Young's modulus using the Supersonics Imagine Aixplorer. The median Young's modulus measured through the inter-costal space was 5.55 ± 0.74 kPa. The intra-operator reliability was better for same-day evaluations (ICC = 0.91) than the inter-operator reliability (ICC = 0.78). Intra-observer agreement decreased when scans were repeated on a different day. Inter-session repeatability was between 3.3% and 9.9% for intra-day repeated scans, compared with to 6.5%-12% for inter-day repeated scans.

The optimal 2-D SWE cutoff values for predicting significant fibrosis were 8.03 kPa for fibrosis stage ≥2 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.832) and 13.1 kPa for fibrosis stage 4 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.915), respectively. In conclusion, 2-D SWE can be used to obtain reliable liver stiffness measurements in almost all patients and performs very well in predicting the presence of liver cirrhosis.",
      "# Title: Assessment of liver fibrosis with 2-D shear wave elastography in comparison to transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse imaging in patients with chronic liver disease.\n# Abstract: Two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2-D SWE) is an ultrasound-based elastography method integrated into a conventional ultrasound machine. It can evaluate larger regions of interest and, therefore, might be better at determining the overall fibrosis distribution. The aim of this prospective study was to compare 2-D SWE with the two best evaluated liver elastography methods, transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse (point SWE using acoustic radiation force impulse) imaging, in the same population group. The study included 132 patients with chronic hepatopathies, in which liver stiffness was evaluated using transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging and 2-D SWE. The reference methods were liver biopsy for the assessment of liver fibrosis (n = 101) and magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography for the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis (n = 31). No significant difference in diagnostic accuracy, assessed as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), was found between the three elastography methods (2-D SWE, transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging) for the diagnosis of significant and advanced fibrosis and liver cirrhosis in the \"per protocol\" (AUROCs for fibrosis stages ≥2: 0.90, 0.95 and 0.91; for fibrosis stage [F] ≥3: 0.93, 0.95 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.92, 0.96 and 0.92) and \"intention to diagnose\" cohort (AUROCs for F ≥2: 0.87, 0.92 and 0.91; for F ≥3: 0.91, 0.93 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.88, 0.90 and 0.89). Therefore, 2-D SWE, ARFI imaging and transient elastography seem to be comparably good methods for non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis.",

      "# Title: Liver stiffness in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: A comparison of supersonic shear imaging, FibroScan, and ARFI with liver biopsy.\n# Abstract: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a major public health issue. The goal of this study was to assess the clinical use of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) evaluated by supersonic shear imaging (SSI), FibroScan, and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) in a cohort of NAFLD patients who underwent liver biopsy. A total of 291 NAFLD patients were prospectively enrolled from November 2011 to February 2015 at 2 French university hospitals. LSM was assessed by SSI, FibroScan (M probe), and ARFI within two weeks prior to liver biopsy. Calculations of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) were performed and compared for the staging of liver fibrosis. AUROC for SSI, FibroScan, and ARFI were 0.86, 0.82, and 0.77 for diagnoses of ≥F2; 0.89, 0.86, and 0.84 for ≥F3; and 0.88, 0.87, and 0.84 for F4, respectively. SSI had a higher accuracy than ARFI for diagnoses of significant fibrosis (≥F2) (P = 0.004). Clinical factors related to obesity such as body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2) , waist circumference ≥102 cm or increased parietal wall thickness were associated with LSM failures when using SSI or FibroScan and with unreliable results when using ARFI. In univariate analysis, FibroScan values were slightly correlated with NAFLD activity score and steatosis (R = 0.28 and 0.22, respectively), whereas SSI and ARFI were not; however, these components of NAFLD did not affect LSM results in multivariate analysis. The cutoff values for SSI and FibroScan for staging fibrosis with a sensitivity ≥90% were very close: 6.3/6.2 kPa for ≥F2, 8.3/8.2 kPa for ≥F3, and 10.5/9.5 kPa for F4.",

Our prospective study included 115 consecutive patients with suspected or alleged chronic hepatitis. Patients underwent SWE by two different operators and TE by sonographers on the same day. The correlation coefficient of the intra-class correlation test between an experienced radiologist and a third-year radiology resident was 0.878. There was a moderate correlation between SWE and TE (r = 0.511) in the diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis. The best cutoff values predicting significant hepatic fibrosis and liver cirrhosis by SWE were >1.78 m/s (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] = 0.777) and >2.24 m/s (AUROC = 0.935), respectively.

Patients with CHB infection who underwent liver biopsy were consecutively included. After exclusions, 257 patients were analyzed. Two-dimensional SWE resulted in a significantly higher rate of reliable measurements (98.1%, 252/257) than TE (93.0%, 239/257) (p = 0.011). Liver stiffness measurements of the two examinations exhibited a strong correlation (r = 0.835, p < 0.001).

There were no significant differences between the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of 2-D SWE and TE for liver fibrosis staging (all p values > 0.05). Two-dimensional SWE had diagnostic accuracy comparable to that of TE for liver fibrosis staging. The measurements that the two techniques provide are not interchangeable.",

The purpose of this study was to perform an intra-individual comparison between 2-D shear wave elastography (2-D-SWE with a GE system) and Virtual Touch Tissue Quantification (VTTQ with a Siemens system) to assess whether these can be used interchangeably to grade fibrosis. Ninety-three patients (51 men, 42 women; mean age, 54 y) with liver disease of various etiologies (hepatitis B virus = 47, hepatitis C virus = 22; alcohol = 6, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis = 5, other = 13) were included. Using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values, liver fibrosis was classified into clinically non-significant (F0/F1) and significant (≥F2) fibrosis. Results indicated that intra-modality repeatability was excellent for both techniques (GE 2-D-SWE: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.89 [0.84-0.93]; VTTQ: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.90 [0.86-0.93]). Intra-modality classification agreement for fibrosis grading was good to excellent (GE 2-D-SWE: κ = 0.65, VTTQ: κ = 0.82). However, inter-modality agreement for fibrosis grading was only fair (κ = 0.31) using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values of fibrosis. In conclusion, although both GE 2-D-SWE and Siemens VTTQ exhibit good to excellent intra-modality repeatability, inter-modality agreement is only fair, suggesting that these should not be used interchangeably.",

    "referenceConclusion": "Pre-conditioning significantly reduced the severity of creatine kinase release, delayed-onset muscle soreness, loss of maximal voluntary contraction force and the range of motion decrease. Pre-conditioning may prevent severe EIMD and accelerate recovery of muscle force generation capacity. The current systematic review identified that pre-conditioning activities are effective in attenuating EIMD measures, CK, muscle soreness, ROM and maximal voluntary force production. These findings suggest the use of pre-conditioning activities prior to a strenuous bout of exercise does provide a significant protective effect when performed a minimum of 24 h prior to the damaging stimulus. Furthermore, the greater improvement in MVC suggests that the pre-conditioning activities may accelerate the recovery of muscle contractile properties following strenuous exercises. However, it is unclear if pre-conditioning would prevent EIMD from more complex exercises or to what extent EIMD prevention carries over into other modes of exercise.",

      "# Title: Muscle tenderness and peak torque changes after downhill running following a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: Unaccustomed exercise (usually of an eccentric nature) is often followed by delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Previous studies have found that prior eccentric activity produces a training effect which reduces DOMS and morphological changes. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a prior bout of maximal isokinetic eccentric exercise on DOMS, strength loss and plasma creatine kinase (CK) changes following a downhill run. Ten male subjects with a mean (+/- S.D.) age of 22.5 +/- 2.8 years, body mass of 62.67 +/- 0.05 kg and height of 176 +/- 3 cm were allocated to either a treatment group or a control group. The treatment group performed 100 maximal eccentric activations of the knee extensors in the dominant leg at 0.52 rad s-1. Two weeks later, the downhill run was performed on a motor-driven treadmill. This consisted of five bouts of 8 min at a gradient of -10% at a speed corresponding to 80% of the predicted maximal heart rate. The untrained group performed the downhill run as above but without the prior isokinetic session. Tenderness measurements, plasma CK activity and concentric and eccentric isokinetic peak torque measurements of the knee extensors at 0.52 and 2.83 rad s-1 were recorded prior to, immediately following and 2, 4 and 7 days after each protocol. The isokinetic protocol caused an increase (P < 0.01) in CK and tenderness and a decrease (P < 0.05) in concentric and eccentric torque at both speeds in the treatment group. Following the downhill run, a reduction in peak torque (P < 0.01) was observed in the eccentric and concentric modes at both isokinetic speeds in the control group. For the treatment group, the decrease in peak torque occurred only at the faster eccentric speed. With the exception of the faster eccentric speed, the decrement in peak torque was greater in the control group in all post-exercise isokinetic strength tests. There was less tenderness (P < 0.01) in the trained knee extensor muscle group. Peak torque also returned to pre-downhill values earlier for the trained group. Although plasma CK activity increased in both groups after downhill running, it was much lower (P < 0.01) in the trained group. The results suggest that a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric training reduces muscle damage, reduces the amount of strength loss and decreases the sensation of DOMS after downhill running.",
      "# Title: Exercise-induced skeletal muscle damage and adaptation following repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions.\n# Abstract: Repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions were used to examine indirect indices of exercise-induced muscle damage and adaptation in human skeletal muscle. Twenty-four subjects (18 females, 6 males) aged 20.0 +/- 1.4 years (mean +/- S.D.) performed an initial bout of either 10 (n = 7), 30 (n = 9) or 50 (n = 8) maximum voluntary eccentric contractions of the knee extensors, followed by a second bout of 50 contractions 3 weeks later using the same leg. Muscle soreness was elevated after all bouts (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon test), although the initial bout reduced the soreness associated with the second bout. Force loss and a decline in the 20:100 Hz percutaneous electrical myostimulation force ratio were observed after all exercise bouts (P < 0.01). Serum creatine kinase activity was elevated following the initial bouts of 30 and 50 repetitions (P < 0.01), but there was no increase following 10 repetitions. No increase in serum creatine kinase activity was observed in any group following the second bout of contractions (P > 0.05). We conclude that skeletal muscle adaptation can be brought about by a single bout of relatively few eccentric muscle contractions. Increasing the number of eccentric muscle repetitions did not result in an increased prophylactic effect on skeletal muscle.",
      "# Title: Influence of previous concentric exercise on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether a fatiguing concentric exercise performed immediately before eccentric exercise would exacerbate eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. One arm of nine female subjects (mean +/- s: 23.3 +/- 6.7 years) performed 12 maximal eccentric actions of the elbow flexors (ECC), and the other arm performed 100 repetitions of isokinetic concentric actions of the elbow flexors followed by the same eccentric exercise (CON-ECC). The two exercise regimens (ECC and CON-ECC) were separated by 2 weeks and presented in a counterbalanced order. Changes in muscle soreness level, maximal isometric force generation, relaxed and flexed elbow joint angle, upper arm circumference and plasma creatine kinase activity were compared between the ECC and CON-ECC conditions. All measures changed significantly after both ECC and CON-ECC; however, there were significant differences in the changes between the conditions. A lower level of soreness, a faster recovery of maximal isometric force generation, a smaller decrease in relaxed elbow joint angle and a smaller increase in upper arm circumference and creatine kinase activity were evident after the CON-ECC condition compared to the ECC condition. Thus, it would seem that muscle damage was attenuated by performance of previous concentric exercise. An additional experiment using a different group of subjects (n = 5) showed that warm-up exercise before the eccentric exercise also attenuated eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.",

      "# Title: The repeated bout effect of reduced-load eccentric exercise on elbow flexor muscle damage.\n# Abstract: In this study we investigated the extent to which an initial eccentric exercise consisting of two (2ECC) or six maximal eccentric actions (6ECC) of the elbow flexors would produce a similar effect to 24 maximal eccentric actions (24ECC), on a second bout of 24ECC performed 2 weeks later. Male students (n = 34) were assigned to one of three groups, and with their non-dominant arm performed either 2ECC (n = 12), 6ECC (n = 10), or 24ECC (n = 12) as a first bout of exercise. Two weeks later all groups performed 24ECC. Maximal isometric strength, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration were assessed before, immediately after, and for 4 days after exercise. Changes in all variables were compared between the bouts and groups by a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance. All variables changed significantly (P< 0.05) after 2ECC, 6ECC, and 24ECC, but the amount of change after 2ECC and 6ECC was significantly smaller (P<0.05) than both 6ECC and 24ECC, and 24ECC, respectively. After the second bout, the 6ECC and 24ECC groups showed a profound repeated bout effect, and no significant differences were found between the groups. All variables except muscle soreness were significantly (P< 0.05) larger after the second bout for the 2ECC group, however the changes observed after 24ECC were significantly smaller (P < 0.01) than those observed after the first 24ECC of the 24ECC group. These results suggest that it is not necessary to conduct a high number of eccentric actions in the first bout to elicit a repeated bout effect in a subsequent bout performed some time later.",

      "# Title: Intensity of eccentric exercise, shift of optimum angle, and the magnitude of repeated-bout effect.\n# Abstract: This study compared the effect of four different intensities of initial eccentric exercise (ECC1) on optimum angle shift and extent of muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise. Fifty-two male students were placed into 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% groups (n = 13 per group), performing 30 eccentric actions of the elbow flexors of 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% of maximal isometric strength [maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)] for ECC1, followed 2-3 wk later by a similar exercise (ECC2) that used 100% MVC load. MVC at six elbow joint angles, range of motion, upper arm circumference, serum creatine kinase activity, myoglobin concentration, and muscle soreness were measured before and for 5 days following ECC1 and ECC2. A rightward shift of optimum angle following ECC1 was significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 100% and 80% than for the 60% and 40% groups, and it decreased significantly (P < 0.05) from immediately to 5 days postexercise. By the time ECC2 was performed, only the 100% group kept a significant shift (4 degrees). Changes in most of the criterion measures following ECC1 were significantly greater for the 100% and 80% groups compared with the 60% and 40% groups. Changes in the criterion measures following ECC2 were significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 40% group compared with other groups. Although the magnitude of repeated bout effect following ECC2 was significantly (P < 0.05) smaller for the 40% and 60% groups, all groups showed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced changes in criterion measures following ECC2 compared with the ECC1 100% bout. We conclude that the repeated-bout effect was not dependent on the shift of optimum angle.",
      "# Title: Repeated bout effect after maximal eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: We hypothesized that a bout of high or low volume eccentric exercise would protect against muscle damage following a subsequent high volume bout and that adaptation would be attributable to neural changes, independent of the initial exercise volume. Sixteen males performed either 45 (ECC45) or 10 (ECC10) maximal eccentric contractions using the elbow flexors, followed by an ECC45 bout 2 weeks later. Damage markers were measured for the following 96 h; EMG and work done during the first 10 eccentric contractions were also recorded. CK, soreness, and decrements in MVC and range of motion (ROM) were greater in bout 1 than bout 2 (p < 0.01). Soreness, MVC and ROM were greater after the initial ECC45 bout compared to the initial ECC10 bout and the repeated bouts of ECC45 exercise in both groups (p < 0.01). Median frequency decreased from bout 1 to bout 2 (p < 0.001), no differences between groups were observed. An ECC45 bout of maximal eccentric exercise causes more initial damage than an ECC10 bout of maximal eccentric exercise, although both confer protection from subsequent ECC45 bouts of maximal eccentric contractions, which are attributable, at least in part, to a shift in the frequency content of EMG.",
      "# Title: A light load eccentric exercise confers protection against a subsequent bout of more demanding eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that a light eccentric exercise (ECC) that does not induce a loss of muscle function and delayed onset muscle soreness would confer a protective effect against a more strenuous ECC. Eighteen young men were randomly placed into two groups: 10-40% (n=9) and 40% (n=9). Subjects in the 10-40% group performed ECC of the elbow flexors (six sets of five reps) using a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (MVC) at an elbow joint angle of 90 degrees , followed 2 days later by ECC using a dumbbell weight of 40% MVC. Subjects in the 40% group performed the 40% ECC only. Changes in MVC, range of motion (ROM), upper arm circumference (CIR), plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and muscle soreness before, immediately after, 1-5 and 7 days following the 40% ECC were compared between groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any of the criterion measures were found immediately and 1-2 days after the 10% ECC. Following the 40% ECC, the 10-40% group showed significantly (P<0.05) smaller decreases in MVC and ROM, and smaller increases in muscle soreness compared with the 40% group, but no significant differences between groups were evident for CIR and plasma CK activity. These results suggest that the 10% ECC induced some protection against a subsequent bout of 40% ECC performed 2 days later. It appears that the light eccentric exercise preconditioned the muscles for exposure to the subsequent damaging eccentric exercise bout.",
      "# Title: Protection against muscle damage following fifty drop jumps conferred by ten drop jumps.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether 10 drop jumps (DJs) would confer protective effect against muscle damage and soreness in a subsequent bout of 50 DJs. Sixteen men were randomly placed into either a group performing 1 set of 10 DJs followed by 5 sets of 10 DJs (10-50, n = 8) or another group performing 2 bouts of 5 sets of 10 DJs (50-50, n = 8) separated by 2 weeks. The DJs were performed from a box height of 0.6 m, with a 10-second interval between jumps and a 1-minute rest between sets. Jump height, peak vertical ground reaction force, ground contact time, and heart rate during DJs were measured, and blood lactate concentration was assessed before and immediately after DJs. Changes in maximal isometric (ISO) and isokinetic concentric torque (CON), vertical jump, muscle soreness, and plasma creatine kinase activity before, immediately after, and at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours following exercise were compared between groups for the first and second bouts and between the bouts by a 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance. Changes in ISO, CON, vertical jump, and muscle soreness were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller for 10 DJs compared with 50 DJs; however, no significant differences in the measures between groups were evident following the second bout. The changes in the measures following 50 DJs in the 10-50 group were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller than those following the first bout of the 50-50 group. These results suggest that 10 DJs and 50 DJs conferred the same magnitude of protective effect against muscle damage by 50 DJs.",
      "# Title: Muscle damage protection by low-intensity eccentric contractions remains for 2 weeks but not 3 weeks.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that the protective effect conferred by a low-intensity eccentric exercise against maximal eccentric exercise would not last more than a week. Untrained men (21.3 ± 1.6 years) were allocated into either a control or one of four repeated bout groups (n = 13 per group). The repeated bout groups performed 30 low-intensity eccentric contractions (ECC) of the elbow flexors with a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (10%-ECC) either 2 days, 7 days (1 week), 14 days (2 weeks) or 21 days (3 weeks) before 30 maximal eccentric contractions (Max-ECC). The control group performed Max-ECC only. Changes in maximal voluntary contraction strength, optimum angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following 10%-ECC were analysed by a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Changes in the variables following Max-ECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. The 10%-ECC did not change any variables, showing no indication of muscle damage. The changes in all variables following Max-ECC were smaller (P < 0.05) for 2-day, 1- and 2-week groups than control group, without significant differences between 2-day and 1-week groups. The 2-week group showed greater (P < 0.05) changes in all variables compared with 2-day and 1-week groups. Changes in the variables were similar between 3-week and control groups, except for muscle soreness showing smaller (P < 0.05) changes for 3-week group. These results suggest that non-damaging eccentric exercise confers a protective effect against Max-Ecc, but the effect is attenuated between 1 and 2 weeks.",
      "# Title: Two maximal isometric contractions attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVC-ISO) would attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. Young untrained men were placed into one of the two experimental groups or one control group (n = 13 per group). Subjects in the experimental groups performed either two or 10 MVC-ISO of the elbow flexors at a long muscle length (20° flexion) 2 days prior to 30 maximal isokinetic eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors. Subjects in the control group performed the eccentric contractions without MVC-ISO. No significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction peak torque, peak torque angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and myoglobin concentration, muscle soreness, and ultrasound echo intensity were evident after MVC-ISO. Changes in the variables following eccentric contractions were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2 MVC-ISO group (e.g., peak torque loss at 5 days after exercise, 23% ± 3%; peak CK activity, 1964 ± 452 IU·L(-1); peak muscle soreness, 46 ± 4 mm) or the 10 MVC-ISO group (13% ± 3%, 877 ± 198 IU·L(-1), 30 ± 4 mm) compared with the control (34% ± 4%, 6192 ± 1747 IU·L(-1), 66 ± 5 mm). The 10 MVC-ISO group showed smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following eccentric contractions compared with the 2 MVC-ISO group. Therefore, two MVC-ISO conferred potent protective effects against muscle damage, whereas greater protective effect was induced by 10 MVC-ISO, which can be used as a strategy to minimize muscle damage.",

      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions attenuate muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise of the knee extensors in the elderly.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors would attenuate the magnitude of muscle damage induced by maximal eccentric exercise of the same muscle performed 7 days later using elderly individuals. Healthy older men (66.4 ± 4.6 years) were assigned to control or experimental (Exp) group (n = 13 per group). The control group performed six sets of ten maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC) of the knee extensors of non-dominant leg. The Exp group performed six sets of ten low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors on a leg extension machine by lowering a weight of 10 % maximal voluntary isometric knee extension strength (10 %ECC) 7 days prior to MaxECC. Changes in maximal voluntary isokinetic concentric torque (MVC-CON), angle at peak torque, range of motion (ROM), upper thigh circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin (Mb) concentration and B-mode ultrasound echo-intensity before and for 5 days after MaxECC were compared between groups by a mixed factor ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were observed following 10 %ECC. Following MaxECC, all variables changed significantly, and changes in all variables except for angle at peak torque were significantly different between groups. MVC-CON and ROM decreased smaller and recovered faster (P < 0.05) for Exp than control group, and changes in other variables were smaller (P < 0.05) for Exp group compared with control group. These results suggest that preconditioning knee extensor muscles with low-intensity eccentric contractions was effective for attenuating muscle damage induced by subsequent MaxECC of the knee extensors for elderly individuals.",
      "# Title: Effect of two maximal isometric contractions on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the elbow flexors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the time wise protective effect conferred by two maximal voluntary isometric contractions (2MVCs) at 20° elbow flexion on muscle damage induced by 30 maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors (MaxECC). Sixty-five young untrained men were randomly assigned to a control group that did not perform 2MVCs, or one of four experimental groups (n = 13 per group) who performed 2MVCs either immediately (0d), 2 (2d), 4 (4d) or 7 days (7d) before MaxECC. Changes in maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) concentric torque (MVC-CON), optimum angle (OA), range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following MaxECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were evident following 2MVCs. The 2d and 4d groups showed 16-62 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following MaxECC than the control, 0d and 7d groups. The 2d group showed 14-34 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables except for OA compared with the 4d group. The changes in the variables were similar among the control, 0d and 7d groups. These results show that 2MVCs that were performed between 2 and 4 days before MaxECC attenuated the magnitude of muscle damage, but no such effect was evident if the 2MVCs were performed immediately or 7 days before MaxECC. It is concluded that the protective effect conferred by 2MVCs is relatively short-lived, and there is a window for the effect to be conferred.",
      "# Title: Effect of a prior bout of preconditioning exercise on muscle damage from downhill walking.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether reduced-duration downhill walking (DW) would confer a protective effect against muscle damage induced by a subsequent bout of longer duration DW performed 1 week or 4 weeks later. Healthy young adults were allocated to a control or one of the preconditioning exercise (PRE-1wk or PRE-4wk) groups (10 men and 4 women per group). PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups performed 20-min DW (-28% slope, 5 km/h, 10% body mass added to a backpack) 1 week and 4 weeks before 40-min DW, respectively, and the control group performed 40-min DW only. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) knee extension torque, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity, and muscle soreness (100-mm visual analog scale) were measured before, immediately after, and 24, 48, and 72 h after DW, and the changes in these variables were compared among groups. The control group showed symptoms of muscle damage (e.g., prolonged decrease in MVC: -14% ± 10% at 48 h post-DW) after 40-min DW. Changes in all variables after 40-min DW of PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups were 54%-61% smaller (P < 0.05) than the control group, without significant differences between PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups for MVC and plasma CK activity. Importantly, changes after the preconditioning exercise (20-min DW) were 67%-69% smaller (P < 0.05) than those after the 40-min DW of the control group. These findings suggest that 20-min DW resulting in minor muscle damage conferred a protective effect against subsequent 40-min DW, and its effect could last for more than 4 weeks.",

      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors and flexors protect against muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the magnitude and duration of the protective effect of low-intensity eccentric contractions (LowEC) against damage induced by maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) of the knee flexors (KF) and extensors (KE). Young men were assigned to 8 experimental groups and 2 control groups (n = 13/group); the experimental groups performed LowEC of KF or KE 2 days (2d), 1 week (1wk), 2 weeks (2wk), or 3 weeks (3wk) before MaxEC, while the control groups performed MaxEC of KF or KE without LowEC. The 2d, 1wk, 2wk, and 3wk groups performed 30 LowEC of KF or 60 LowEC of KE with a load of 10% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction strength on a resistance-training machine, and all groups performed 30 MaxEC of KF or 60 MaxEC of KE on an isokinetic dynamometer. Several muscle damage markers were measured from before to 2 days after exercise (LowEC) or from before to 5 days after exercise (MaxEC). No significant changes in any variables were evident after LowEC. The changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2d and 1wk groups (e.g., peak creatine kinase activity: 1002 ± 501 IU/L; peak muscle soreness: 13 ± 5 mm) than for the control group (peak creatine kinase activity: 3005 ± 983 IU/L; peak muscle soreness 28 ± 6 mm) for both KE and KF. There were no significant differences between the 2d and 1wk groups or among the 2wk, 3wk, and control groups. These results show that LowEC provided 30%-66% protection against damage induced by MaxEC of KF and KE, and the protective effect lasted 1 week.",
      "# Title: Protective effect by maximal isometric contractions against maximal eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the knee extensors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) performed before maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) would attenuate muscle damage of the knee extensors. Untrained men were placed to an experimental group that performed 6 sets of 10 MVIC at 90° knee flexion 2 weeks before 6 sets of 10 MaxEC or a control group that performed MaxEC only (n = 13/group). Changes in muscle damage markers were assessed before to 5 days after each exercise. Small but significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction torque, range of motion (ROM) and plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity were evident at immediately to 2 days post-MVIC (p < 0.05), but other variables (e.g. thigh girth, myoglobin concentration, B-mode echo intensity) did not change significantly. Changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (p < 0.05) by 45% (soreness)-67% (CK) for the experimental than the control group. These results suggest that MVIC conferred potent protective effect against MaxEC-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Prevention of downhill walking-induced muscle damage by non-damaging downhill walking.\n# Abstract: Mountain trekking involves level, uphill, and downhill walking (DW). Prolonged DW induces damage to leg muscles, reducing force generating ability and muscle coordination. These increase risks for more serious injuries and accidents in mountain trekking, thus a strategy to minimize muscle damage is warranted. It has been shown that low-intensity eccentric contractions confer protective effect on muscle damage induced by high-intensity eccentric contractions. This study tested the hypothesis that 5-min non-damaging DW would attenuate muscle damage induced by 40-min DW, but 5-min level walking (LW) would not.",
      "# Title: Isometric pre-conditioning blunts exercise-induced muscle damage but does not attenuate changes in running economy following downhill running.\n# Abstract: Running economy (RE) is impaired following unaccustomed eccentric-biased exercises that induce muscle damage. It is also known that muscle damage is reduced when maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) are performed at a long muscle length 2-4 days prior to maximal eccentric exercise with the same muscle, a phenomenon that can be described as isometric pre-conditioning (IPC). We tested the hypothesis that IPC could attenuate muscle damage and changes in RE following downhill running. Thirty untrained men were randomly assigned into experimental or control groups and ran downhill on a treadmill (-15%) for 30 min. Participants in the experimental group completed 10 MVIC in a leg press machine two days prior to downhill running, while participants in the control group did not perform IPC. The magnitude of changes in muscle soreness determined 48 h after downhill running was greater for the control group (122 ± 28 mm) than for the experimental group (92 ± 38 mm). Isometric peak torque recovered faster in the experimental group compared with the control group (3 days vs. no full recovery, respectively). No significant effect of IPC was found for countermovement jump height, serum creatine kinase activity or any parameters associated with RE. These results supported the hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in markers of muscle damage. The hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in RE was not supported by our data. It appears that the mechanisms involved in changes in markers of muscle damage and parameters associated with RE following downhill running are not completely shared.",

      "# Title: Protective Effect Conferred by Isometric Preconditioning Against Slow- and Fast-Velocity Eccentric Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage.\n# Abstract: We investigated if the same isometric preconditioning protocol (IPP) attenuates the magnitude of muscle damage induced by different maximal eccentric exercise protocols in the elbow flexors. Sixty-four untrained men were assigned to either two experimental or two control groups. Participants in the experimental groups performed an IPP prior to either slow (60°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-S) or fast (180°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-F) maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC). Subjects in the control groups performed slow (ECC-S) or fast (ECC-F) MaxECC without IPP. Maximal isokinetic concentric torque (MVC), muscle soreness (SOR), and muscle thickness (MT) were assessed before, immediately after, and 1-4 days following the MaxECC. Significant (p < 0.05) group vs. time interactions were found for MVC (F = 4,517), SOR (F = 6,318), and MT (F = 1,863). The ECC-S group presented faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and MT and less (p < 0.05) SOR at 96 h post-MaxECC compared with ECC-F group. No significant differences in MVC and MT were found between ECC-S and ECC-F groups following MaxECC. The ISO + ECC-S group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and SOR compared to the ECC-S group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ECC-S in any variable. The ISO + ECC-F group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of all assessed variables compared with the ECC-F group. MVC was greater (p < 0.05) at 48-72 h, and SOR was less (p < 0.05) at 48-96 h in the ISO + ECC-F compared to the ECC-F group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ISO + ECC-F for any variable. These results show that the IPP accelerated recovery of MVC and SOR for the slow-eccentric exercise condition and attenuated strength loss and SOR in addition to faster recovery of all assessed variables for the fast-eccentric exercise condition. Therefore, the IPP can be used as a strategy to attenuate and accelerate recovery of muscle damage induced by different-velocity eccentric exercises, resulting in greater protection against muscle damage induced by faster velocity."

      "# Title: Iron overload in cirrhosis-HFE genotypes and outcome after liver transplantation.\n# Abstract: Previously, we found appreciable hepatic iron deposition in one third of our patients undergoing liver transplantation (LTx) with approximately 10% of cases having quantifiable iron in the range of that seen in hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC). The aim of this study was to compare clinical outcome in liver transplant patients with and without iron overload. We also sought to determine the prevalence of HFE mutations in liver transplant patients with iron overload. Of 456 consecutive liver transplants, 41 explants had an hepatic iron index (HII) greater than 1.9, and these cases were compared to 41 matched liver transplant recipients without increased hepatic iron. Posttransplantation complications, along with patient and graft survival were monitored. HFE gene testing was performed using DNA-based techniques. Kaplan-Meier 5-year patient survival after LTx was significantly lower in cases with hepatic iron overload compared to matched controls without iron excess (48% vs. 77%; P =.045). Fatal infections (especially fungal) were more common in patients with iron overload (24% vs. 7%; P =.03). Of the 41 patients with a liver explant HII greater than 1.9, only 4 were C282Y homozygotes. Patients with severe hepatic explant iron overload undergoing LTx have a reduced survival compared to liver transplant recipients without explant iron excess. The reduced survival was attributable mainly to fatal bacterial and fungal infections. Despite the iron overload, HFE gene mutations were uncommon in patients with hepatic explant hemosiderosis.",

Iron overload has already been associated with increased risk of fungal infections, but it has not yet been assessed as a risk factor in liver transplantation. We retrospectively studied a cohort of 153 consecutive patients who underwent their first liver transplantation at a single center and who survived at least 7 days after transplantation. The association between various pretransplant patient characteristics, including hepatic explant iron and risk of invasive fungal infections, was analyzed by univariate and multivariate models. Iron in the hepatic explant was assessed by Perl's Prussian blue stain by a pathologist blinded to clinical outcome. During the first year after transplantation, 28 of 153 patients developed a total of 31 invasive fungal infections, of which 21 (68%) were caused by Candida, 7 (23%) by Aspergillus, 2 (6%) by Cryptococcus, and 1 (3%) by Saccharomyces. Stainable iron in the hepatic explant was found in 48 patients (31%). Stainable iron in the hepatic explant was found to be strongly and independently associated with posttransplantation fungal infections in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 3.09; 95% confidence interval 1.45-6.56; P = 0.003). Hepatic iron overload is strongly and independently associated with posttransplantation invasive fungal infections. Studies to confirm this finding in other centers and define the mechanism are warranted.",
      "# Title: Serum ferritin concentration predicts mortality in patients awaiting liver transplantation.\n# Abstract: Additional markers are required to identify patients on the orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) waiting list at increased risk of death and adverse clinical events. Serum ferritin concentration is a marker of varied pathophysiological events and is elevated with increased liver iron concentration, hepatic necroinflammation, and systemic illness, all of which may cause a deterioration in liver function and clinical status. The aim of this study was to determine whether serum ferritin concentration is an independent prognostic factor in subjects awaiting OLT. This is a dual-center retrospective study. The study cohort consisted of 191 consecutive adults with cirrhosis accepted by the Queensland (Australia) Liver Transplant Service between January 2000 and June 2006 and a validation cohort of 131 patients from University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Transplant Center. In the study cohort, baseline serum ferritin greater than 200 microg/L was an independent factor predicting increased 180-day and 1-year waiting list mortality. This effect was independent of model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), hepatocellular carcinoma, age, and sex. Subjects with higher serum ferritin had increased frequency of liver-related clinical events. The relationship between serum ferritin and waiting list mortality was confirmed in the UCLA cohort; all deceased patients had serum ferritin greater than 400 microg/L. Serum ferritin greater than 500 microg/L and MELD were independent risk factors for death.",

      "# Title: Serum ferritin concentration and transferrin saturation before liver transplantation predict decreased long-term recipient survival.\n# Abstract: Serum ferritin (SF) concentration is a widely available parameter used to assess iron homeostasis. It has been described as a marker to identify high-risk patients awaiting liver transplantation (LT) but is also elevated in systemic immune-mediated diseases, metabolic syndrome, and in hemodialysis where it is associated with an inferior prognosis. This study analyzed whether SF is not only a predictor of liver-related mortality prior to LT but also an independent marker of survival following LT. In a dual-center, retrospective study, a cohort of 328 consecutive first-LT patients from Hannover Medical School, Germany (2003-2008, follow-up 1260 days), and 82 consecutive LT patients from Regensburg University Hospital, Germany (2003-2007, follow-up 1355 days) as validation cohort were analyzed. In patients exhibiting SF ≥365 μg/L versus <365 μg/L prior to LT, 1-, 3-, and 5-year post-LT survival was 73.3% versus 81.1%, 64.4% versus 77.3%, and 61.1% versus 74.4%, respectively (overall survival P = 0.0097), which was confirmed in the validation cohort (overall survival of 55% versus 83.3%, P = 0.005). Multivariate analyses identified SF ≥365 μg/L combined with transferrin saturation (TFS) <55%, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the survival after LT (SALT) score as independent risk factors for death. In patients with SF concentrations ≥365 μg/L and TFS <55%, overall survival was 54% versus 74.8% in the remaining group (P = 0.003). In the validation cohort, it was 28.6% versus 72% (P = 0.017), respectively.",

Does ferritin actually predict outcome?\n# Abstract: Recent data suggest an association of serum ferritin (SF) with waiting list (WL) and postliver transplant (LT) outcomes. To assess the predictive capacity of SF on pre- and post-LT outcomes, and to identify whether recipient or donor liver siderosis is associated with post-LT survival; a retrospective analysis of 1079 patients assessed for first LT, 2000-2007 was performed. Iron deposition in the liver tissue was assessed using a semi-quantitative grading system. Median age was 54 (18-82) years and 67% were male. Seventeen per cent had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Median Model for End-stage Liver Disease MELD score was 14 (6-40), ferritin was 174 μg/l (4-4597) with 36.5% had a SF ≥ μg/l. Age (OR = 1.028) and MELD score (OR = 1.158) were independently associated with WL mortality (P < 0.001), whilst SF was not (P = NS). Age (OR = 1.018), HCC (OR = 1.542) and cold ischemia time (CIT) ≥ 10 h (OR = 1.418) were independently associated with post-LT survival (P < 0.05). Explant siderosis grade <2 was seen in 376 (71.7%) patients. Patients with explant siderosis grade ≥ 2 had inferior 12-month post-LT survival (P = 0.030). Presence of graft siderosis (15.8% of patients) was not associated with survival. In conclusion, we found a limited role for SF as a prognostic indicator for pre- or post-transplant survival.",
      "# Title: Iron-related markers are associated with infection after liver transplantation.\n# Abstract: Though serum iron has been known to be associated with an increased risk of infection, hepcidin, the major regulator of iron metabolism, has never been systematically explored in this setting. Finding early biomarkers of infection, such as hepcidin, could help identify patients in whom early empiric antimicrobial therapy would be beneficial. We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients (n = 128) undergoing first-time, single-organ orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) without known iron overload disorders at 2 academic hospitals in Boston from August 2009 to November 2012. Cox regression compared the associations between different iron markers and the development of first infection at least 1 week after OLT; 47 (37%) patients developed a primary outcome of infection at least 1 week after OLT and 1 patient died. After adjusting for perioperative bleeding complications, number of hospital days, and hepatic artery thrombosis, changes in iron markers were associated with the development of infection post-OLT including increasing ferritin (hazard ratio [HR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-2.05), rising ferritin slope (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.17), and increasing hepcidin (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.05-1.93). A decreasing iron (HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.20-2.57) and a decreasing iron slope (HR, 4.21; 95% CI, 2.51-7.06) were also associated with subsequent infections.

During the first year after transplantation, 28 of 153 patients developed a total of 31 invasive fungal infections, of which 21 (68%) were caused by Candida, 7 (23%) by Aspergillus, 2 (6%) by Cryptococcus, and 1 (3%) by Saccharomyces. Stainable iron in the hepatic explant was found in 48 patients (31%). Stainable iron in the hepatic explant was found to be strongly and independently associated with posttransplantation fungal infections in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 3.09; 95% confidence interval 1.45-6.56; P = 0.003). Hepatic iron overload is strongly and independently associated with posttransplantation invasive fungal infections. Studies to confirm this finding in other centers and define the mechanism are warranted.",
      "# Title: Serum ferritin concentration predicts mortality in patients awaiting liver transplantation.\n# Abstract: Additional markers are required to identify patients on the orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) waiting list at increased risk of death and adverse clinical events. Serum ferritin concentration is a marker of varied pathophysiological events and is elevated with increased liver iron concentration, hepatic necroinflammation, and systemic illness, all of which may cause a deterioration in liver function and clinical status. The aim of this study was to determine whether serum ferritin concentration is an independent prognostic factor in subjects awaiting OLT. This is a dual-center retrospective study. The study cohort consisted of 191 consecutive adults with cirrhosis accepted by the Queensland (Australia) Liver Transplant Service between January 2000 and June 2006 and a validation cohort of 131 patients from University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Transplant Center. In the study cohort, baseline serum ferritin greater than 200 microg/L was an independent factor predicting increased 180-day and 1-year waiting list mortality. This effect was independent of model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), hepatocellular carcinoma, age, and sex. Subjects with higher serum ferritin had increased frequency of liver-related clinical events. The relationship between serum ferritin and waiting list mortality was confirmed in the UCLA cohort; all deceased patients had serum ferritin greater than 400 microg/L. Serum ferritin greater than 500 microg/L and MELD were independent risk factors for death.",

      "# Title: Serum ferritin concentration and transferrin saturation before liver transplantation predict decreased long-term recipient survival.\n# Abstract: Serum ferritin (SF) concentration is a widely available parameter used to assess iron homeostasis. It has been described as a marker to identify high-risk patients awaiting liver transplantation (LT) but is also elevated in systemic immune-mediated diseases, metabolic syndrome, and in hemodialysis where it is associated with an inferior prognosis. This study analyzed whether SF is not only a predictor of liver-related mortality prior to LT but also an independent marker of survival following LT. In a dual-center, retrospective study, a cohort of 328 consecutive first-LT patients from Hannover Medical School, Germany (2003-2008, follow-up 1260 days), and 82 consecutive LT patients from Regensburg University Hospital, Germany (2003-2007, follow-up 1355 days) as validation cohort were analyzed. In patients exhibiting SF ≥365 μg/L versus <365 μg/L prior to LT, 1-, 3-, and 5-year post-LT survival was 73.3% versus 81.1%, 64.4% versus 77.3%, and 61.1% versus 74.4%, respectively (overall survival P = 0.0097), which was confirmed in the validation cohort (overall survival of 55% versus 83.3%, P = 0.005). Multivariate analyses identified SF ≥365 μg/L combined with transferrin saturation (TFS) <55%, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the survival after LT (SALT) score as independent risk factors for death. In patients with SF concentrations ≥365 μg/L and TFS <55%, overall survival was 54% versus 74.8% in the remaining group (P = 0.003). In the validation cohort, it was 28.6% versus 72% (P = 0.017), respectively.",
      "# Title: The association of pretransplant ferritin level with waiting list and post-transplant survival. Does ferritin actually predict outcome?\n# Abstract: Recent data suggest an association of serum ferritin (SF) with waiting list (WL) and postliver transplant (LT) outcomes. To assess the predictive capacity of SF on pre- and post-LT outcomes, and to identify whether recipient or donor liver siderosis is associated with post-LT survival; a retrospective analysis of 1079 patients assessed for first LT, 2000-2007 was performed. Iron deposition in the liver tissue was assessed using a semi-quantitative grading system. Median age was 54 (18-82) years and 67% were male. Seventeen per cent had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Median Model for End-stage Liver Disease MELD score was 14 (6-40), ferritin was 174 μg/l (4-4597) with 36.5% had a SF ≥ μg/l. Age (OR = 1.028) and MELD score (OR = 1.158) were independently associated with WL mortality (P < 0.001), whilst SF was not (P = NS). Age (OR = 1.018), HCC (OR = 1.542) and cold ischemia time (CIT) ≥ 10 h (OR = 1.418) were independently associated with post-LT survival (P < 0.05). Explant siderosis grade <2 was seen in 376 (71.7%) patients. Patients with explant siderosis grade ≥ 2 had inferior 12-month post-LT survival (P = 0.030). Presence of graft siderosis (15.8% of patients) was not associated with survival. In conclusion, we found a limited role for SF as a prognostic indicator for pre- or post-transplant survival.",
      "# Title: Iron-related markers are associated with infection after liver transplantation.\n# Abstract: Though serum iron has been known to be associated with an increased risk of infection, hepcidin, the major regulator of iron metabolism, has never been systematically explored in this setting. Finding early biomarkers of infection, such as hepcidin, could help identify patients in whom early empiric antimicrobial therapy would be beneficial. We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients (n = 128) undergoing first-time, single-organ orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) without known iron overload disorders at 2 academic hospitals in Boston from August 2009 to November 2012. Cox regression compared the associations between different iron markers and the development of first infection at least 1 week after OLT; 47 (37%) patients developed a primary outcome of infection at least 1 week after OLT and 1 patient died. After adjusting for perioperative bleeding complications, number of hospital days, and hepatic artery thrombosis, changes in iron markers were associated with the development of infection post-OLT including increasing ferritin (hazard ratio [HR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-2.05), rising ferritin slope (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.17), and increasing hepcidin (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.05-1.93). A decreasing iron (HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.20-2.57) and a decreasing iron slope (HR, 4.21; 95% CI, 2.51-7.06) were also associated with subsequent infections. In conclusion, hepcidin and other serum iron markers and their slope patterns or their combination are associated with infection in vulnerable patient populations.

      "# Title: Iron metabolism imbalance at the time of listing increases overall and infectious mortality after liver transplantation.\n# Abstract: Liver transplantation (LT) is the best treatment for patients with liver cancer or end stage cirrhosis, but it is still associated with a significant mortality. Therefore identifying factors associated with mortality could help improve patient management. The impact of iron metabolism, which could be a relevant therapeutic target, yield discrepant results in this setting. Previous studies suggest that increased serum ferritin is associated with higher mortality. Surprisingly iron deficiency which is a well described risk factor in critically ill patients has not been considered."

      "conclusionA": "**Primary Concluding Statement:**\n\nEvidence indicates a positive association between iron overload, measured by markers like ferritin, transferrin saturation, and hepatic iron concentration, and an increased risk of infectious complications following liver transplantation, particularly in the early post-transplant period and potentially more strongly for bacterial and fungal infections. This relationship is complex, influenced by the timing of iron overload (pre- vs. post-transplant), interaction with other risk factors like immunosuppression and underlying liver disease, and the specific type of infection. While managing iron overload is crucial for overall post-transplant outcomes, including long-term graft health, definitive evidence demonstrating that standard interventions like phlebotomy or chelation therapy specifically reduce the *incidence* of infectious complications as a primary outcome is limited, though controlling iron burden is considered vital for mitigating overall risk.",

Although the STAT-3 expression was associated with lymph node metastasis from gastric cancer (GC), the implication of SOCS-3 expression in GC is not clearly elucidated. In this study, SOCS-3, STAT-3, and pSTAT-3 were evaluated in GC tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues of 107 patients who underwent curative surgery by immunohistochemistry. Further, SOCS-3 and STAT-3 mRNA levels were also detected simultaneously. In addition, survival analysis was performed between clinicopathologic variables and prognosis of GC patients. Finally, correlative analysis was adopted for demonstration the best predicator of the survival independent factor. From the results, we demonstrated that only the lymph node metastasis was the independent predictor of the overall survival (OS) of GC patients, although SOCS-3, STAT-3, and other variables were significantly relative to OS. With multivariate logistical regression analysis, SOCS-3, STAT-3, and the status of extragastric nodal metastasis were identified to be the independent factors of the lymph node metastasis from GC. Ultimately, the SOCS-3 was the best predicator of lymph node metastasis from GC identified with the nominal regression analysis.

Although tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3, also known as A20) can decrease SOCS3 expression and is involved in the regulation of tumorigenesis in certain malignancies, its role in CCA remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression of SOCS3 and A20 in human CCA tissues to assess the prognostic significance of these proteins. The expression of SOCS3 and A20 was initially detected by western blot in 22 cases of freshly frozen CCA tumors with corresponding peritumoral tissues and 22 control normal bile duct tissues. Then, these proteins were investigated in 86 CCA patients by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and were evaluated for their association with clinicopathological parameters in human CCA. The results indicated that SOCS3 expression was significantly lower in CCA tumor tissues than in corresponding peritumoral biliary tissues and normal bile duct tissues. Conversely, A20 was overexpressed in CCA tissues. Thus, an inverse correlation between the expression of SOCS3 and A20 was discovered. Furthermore, patients with low SOCS3 expression or high A20 expression showed a dramatically lower overall survival rate. These proteins were both associated with CCA lymph node metastasis, postoperative recurrence and overall survival rate. However, only A20 showed a significant association with the tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage, while SOCS3 showed a significant association with tumor differentiation. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that SOCS3 and A20 were independent prognostic indicators for overall survival in CCA. Thus, our study demonstrated that SOCS3 and A20 represent novel prognostic factors for human CCA.",

Furthermore, abolishment or reduction of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) expression directed by promoter methylation is considered significant in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) carcinogenesis. This study aims to investigate BORIS and SOCS3 expression in HCC specimens and assess the prognostic significance of these proteins.BORIS and SOCS3 expression was examined using immunohistochemistry in HCC tissues, along with corresponding paracarcinomatous, cirrhosis, hepatitis, and normal liver tissues. The expression levels of these 2 proteins in HCC were evaluated for their association with clinicopathological parameters. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves, the log-rank test, and multivariate Cox regression analysis.BORIS expression was significantly higher in HCC tissues than in normal liver tissues. In contrast, SOCS3 expression was dramatically lower in HCC tissues. BORIS expression was associated with tumor size, differentiation grade, satellite lesions, and recurrence while SOCS3 expression correlated with differentiation grade, vascular invasion, and recurrence. A significant negative correlation between BORIS and SOCS3 was observed. Patients with high BORIS expression and/or low SOCS3 expression had poorer postoperative survival. Patients with both these characteristics had the poorest prognostic outcome.BORIS and SOCS3 are promising as valuable indicators for predicting HCC prognosis.",

STAT3 signaling pathway is regarded as the \"bridge\" between inflammation and cancer, and involved in the development of CRC. SOCS3 is a key negative feedback regulator of JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Studies about SOCS3 gene in CRC are rarely reported. The purpose of this study is to determine the expression of SOCS3 in CRC tissue and its correlation with the clinical pathological characteristics and prognosis of colorectal cancers. The effects of SOCS3 on biological behavior such as apoptosis, proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor formation in nude mice were studied. We observed that SOCS3 expression was down-regulated in CRC tissues, while IL-6, pSTAT3 were up-regulated. Inflammatory cytokines IL-6 can promote the expression of STAT3 signaling pathways while inhibit the expression of SOCS3 by promoting hypermethylation of SOCS3 gene promoters. 5-Aza-cdR treatment can reverse IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway mediated down-regulation of SOCS3 in colorectal cancer cells. Low expression of SOCS3 was correlated with lymph node metastasis and advanced clinical stage. Patients with high expression of SOCS3 in colorectal cancers often indicated a relatively good prognosis. Overexpression of SOCS3 inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion and tumorigenic ability of CRC cells while increased cell apoptosis. This study demonstrated that IL-6/STAT3 signaling activation negatively regulated SOCS3 expression, which led to imbalance and sustained activation of STAT3 signaling pathway. Reduced expression of SOCS3 promoted the growth and metastasis of colorectal cancer. Thus, targeting IL-6/STAT3/SOCS3 signaling pathway may become an important treatment strategy of colorectal cancer.",

Methods: We assessed the expression of PD-L1, CD276, SOCS3, CD4 and CD8 by immunohistochemistry in tumor tissue from 74 HCC patients who underwent curative hepatectomy. Results: High expression of PD-L1 was significantly associated with high Edmondson grade (p<0.01) and elevated enzyme (p=0.037); high expression of CD276 was significantly correlated with high Edmondson grade (p=0.021); high expression of SOCS3 was significantly associated with age (p=0.026) and tumor size (p=0.041), while PD-L1 showed no significant correlation. The expression of PD-L1, CD276, SOCS3 protein and other clinicopathological factors (sex, vascular invasion, tumor number, tumor capsule, pT stage, liver cirrhosis, HBsAg, TBiL, AFP) showed no significant correlation (p>0.05). High expression of CD8 was respectively significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS) (p=0.002). There was no significantly difference between CD4 and CD8 high-expression and overall survival (OS) (p=0.100). Both high expression of PD-L1 (p=0.003) and low expression of SOCS3 (p=0.015) was significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS). But CD276 only had a trendency (p=0.166). Additionally, multivariate Cox regression models implied that PD-L1, SOCS3, as well as both CD4 and CD8 was an independent prognostic factor for OS (p<0.05). Furthermore, HCC patients with PD-L1 low-expression and SOCS3 high-expression had a better prognostic according to the different pT stages (p<0.05). Conclusions: We for the first time demonstrated that PD-L1 and SOCS3 were independent prognostic factor for HCC patients. Co-expression of low PD-L1 and high SOCS3 could be a better predictive marker for HCC patients."

      "# Title: Serum Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2-binding protein for patients with chronic hepatitis B and C: a comparative study.\n# Abstract: We compared Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2-binding protein (WFA+ -M2BP) levels between patients with chronic hepatitis B (n=249) and chronic hepatitis C (n=386) based on the degree of liver fibrosis. We examined WFA+ -M2BP levels in patients with F4 (cirrhosis), F3 or more (advanced fibrosis) and F2 or more (significant fibrosis) in the two groups. We further examined the relationship between five fibrosis markers and the degree of fibrosis. The WFA+ -M2BP values ranged from 0.25 cut-off index (COI) to 12.9 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 0.34-20.0 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P<.0001). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F4 in the two groups were 2.83 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 5.03 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P=.0046). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F3 or more in the two groups were 1.79 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 3.79 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P<.0001). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F2 or more in the two groups were 1.49 COI in the hepatitis B cohort and 3.19 COI in the hepatitis C group (P<.0001). Among five liver fibrosis markers, WFA+ -M2BP had the highest correlation coefficient (rs =.629) in terms of correlation with the degree of fibrosis in the patients with hepatitis C and had the second highest rs value (.415) in the hepatitis B group. Although WFA+ -M2BP could be a useful indicator of liver fibrosis, WFA+ -M2BP levels in the two groups significantly differed even in the same degree of fibrosis. Individual cut-off values in each aetiology for the degree of fibrosis should be determined.",
      "# Title: Serum Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n# Abstract: Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein (WFA+-M2BP) has been suggested to be useful for the assessment of disease severity in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Consecutive adult NAFLD patients who had a liver biopsy were included. Serum WFA+-M2BP level was measured using a lectin-antibody sandwich immunoassay using a chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay machine (HISCL-5000, Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). The measured levels were indexed using the following equation: Cut-off index (COI) = ([WFA+-M2BP]sample-[WFA+-M2BP]NC) / ([WFA+-M2BP]PC-[WFA+-M2BP]NC), where PC = positive control and NC = negative control. Histopathological examination of liver biopsy specimen was reported according to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Clinical Research Network Scoring System. Data for 220 cases were analyzed. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of NASH was 0.65. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of steatosis grade ≥2 and 3 was 0.64 and 0.53, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of lobular inflammation grade ≥1, ≥2 and 3 was 0.57, 0.68 and 0.59, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of hepatocyte ballooning grade ≥1 and 2 was 0.64 and 0.65, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of fibrosis stage ≥1, ≥2, ≥3 and 4 was 0.61, 0.71, 0.74 and 0.84, respectively. Out of the 220 cases, 152 cases were the same 76 patients who had a repeat liver biopsy after 48 weeks of intervention. The AUROC of the change in the COI to detect improvement in steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning and fibrosis was 0.57, 0.54, 0.59 and 0.52, respectively. In conclusion, serum WFA+-M2BP was most useful for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in NAFLD patients. However, it was less useful for differentiating NASH from non-NASH, and for diagnosis and follow-up of the individual histopathological components of NASH.",
      "# Title: Serum Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2-binding protein expression predicts disease severity in chronic hepatitis C patients.\n# Abstract: Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein (WFA+-M2BP) has recently been developed as a promising liver fibrosis glyco biomarker. We assessed its efficacy in evaluating liver disease severity in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in Taiwan. The association between WFA+-M2BP and histological features was evaluated among those CHC patients underwent liver biopsy. We also aimed to clarify the factors determining the performance of WFA+-M2BP in CHC. A total of 229 CHC patients were consecutively recruited. The mean value of WFA+-M2BP in patients from F0 to F4 was 1.68, 2.23, 3.45, 3.48, 3.77 respectively (linear trend P = 0.008). Linear regression analysis revealed that alanine aminotransferase (odds ratio [OR]: 0.03, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.02-0.05, P < 0.001), AST (OR: -0.1, 95% CI: -0.02 to -0.01, P < 0.001), and liver fibrosis (OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.01-0.59, P = 0.043) were the independent factors correlated to serum WFA+-M2BP level. The optimal cutoff values of WFA+-M2BP for fibrosis stages F1, F2, F3, and F4 were 1.42, 1.61, 1.42, and 2.67, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the platelet count (OR/CI: -0.009/0.986-0.996, P = <0.001), r-glutamyl transferase (OR/CI: 0.007/1.000-1.013, P = 0.036), and WFA+-M2BP (OR/CI: 0.187/1.057-1.374, P = 0.005). We concluded that WFA+-M2BP is a competent noninvasive marker for liver fibrosis assessment in CHC patients.",

      "# Title: Comparison of serum fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B.\n# Abstract: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The diagnosis of liver fibrosis has a key role in selecting patients with CHB for antiviral treatment. However, serum biomarkers demonstrate limited diagnostic utility. The present study aimed to compare the performances of fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB and to identify the most appropriate biomarker for these patients. The current study included 96 antiviral-naïve patients with CHB who underwent liver biopsy. METAVIR scoring system was used to assess liver fibrosis and necroinflammation. The diagnostic performances were evaluated of the platelet (PLT) count; the levels of hyaluronan, serum 7S domain of type 4 collagen, procollagen type III N-terminal peptide, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1, Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) and N-terminal type III collagen propeptide (Pro-C3); the fibrosis index based on four factors; the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index; and enhanced liver fibrosis score for identifying significant liver fibrosis [≥fibrosis stage 2 (F2)]. All fibrosis biomarkers, except the Pro-C3 level, correlated with the fibrosis stage. M2BPGi was better than other biomarkers for diagnosing ≥F2, with the highest area under the curve of 0.902. M2BPGi demonstrated a higher diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis than mild/severe fibrosis or cirrhosis. However, no significant correlation was observed between the M2BPGi level and fibrosis stage in patients with CHB having significant liver necroinflammation defined as ≥ necroinflammatory activity 2. The M2BPGi level and PLT count were exclusively correlated with the fibrosis stage in 73 patients without significant liver necroinflammation. M2BPGi demonstrated the highest diagnostic performance for significant fibrosis in patients having significant liver fibrosis with no significant liver necroinflammation. In conclusion, the M2BPGi level can accurately diagnose significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB.",

      "# Title: Serum Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2-binding protein expression predicts disease severity in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients.\n# Abstract: The role of Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein (WFA+ -M2BP) in the prediction of disease severity in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains elusive. This study evaluated the performance of WFA+ -M2BP in predicting fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. A total of 80 patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) were enrolled. Serum WFA+ -M2BP levels were measured using standard methods. The fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index was also measured. The mean values of WFA+ -M2BP were 1.0, 1.0, 0.8, and 2.2 in Metavir fibrosis stage F0, F1, F2, and F3-4, respectively (linear trend p = 0.005). The optimal cut-off value of WFA+ -M2BP in predicting advanced fibrosis (F3-4) was 1.37 cut-off index (COI), yielding the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, and accuracy of 75.0, 79.4, 39.1, 94.7, and 78.7%, respectively (p < 0.001). Combining WFA+ -M2BP with FIB-4 significantly increased the diagnostic performance for advanced fibrosis, yielding specificity, PPV, and accuracy of 100, 100, and 93%, respectively. The significant factors predicting advanced liver fibrosis in the multivariate regression analysis were WFA+ -M2BP ≥ 1.37 COI (OR/confidence interval [CI]: 9.49/1.63-55.21, p = 0.01) and FIB-4 ≥ 2.80 (OR/CI: 38.18/4.89-297.93, p = 0.001). Monitoring WFA+ -M2BP is suitable for noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis in NASH patients, particularly in combination with FIB-4."

    "referenceConclusion": "This study found a modest decrease in LBR among women with a history of endometriosis, although only results from the pooled analysis of registry data and not those from the meta-analysis reached statistical significance. These findings suggest that a marginal impairment of uterine receptivity may contribute to infertility mechanisms in women affected by endometriosis. Our findings suggest a potential minimal decrease in the LBR among recipients with a history of endometriosis undergoing oocyte donation ART cycles. Because this approach can provide insights into the impact of the condition on the process of embryo implantation, we can deduce that a marginal impairment of uterine receptivity contributes to infertility mechanisms in women affected by endometriosis. Whether this defect is associated with comorbidities or confounders have to be clarified in future studies.",

In order to eliminate these confounding effects, this prospective comparative study studied a population of menopausal recipients with and without endometriosis sharing sibling oocytes coming from the same donor. The aim was to understand the impact of endometriosis on implantation, pregnancy and live birth rates in menopausal recipients. A total of 240 menopausal recipients of donated sibling oocytes, were divided in two groups. Group I consisted of 120 recipients diagnosed with endometriosis and group II consisted of 120 controls. The implantation and pregnancy rates were significantly lower in the endometriosis group compared with the control group (23.81% versus 31.48%, P=0.019; 45.00% versus 58.33%, P=0.039, respectively). In oocyte donation cycles, a recipient's history of endometriosis might have a negative impact on implantation, pregnancy and live birth rates, even in menopausal women. Infertility in endometriosis may be due to poor oocyte quality or embryos with decreased ability to implant due to impaired fertilization. There are no conclusive data on the impact of endometriosis on implantation. The already-known adverse effect of endometriosis on gamete quality makes it more difficult to demonstrate a direct effect of endometriosis on implantation. In order to eliminate these confounding effects we studied a population of menopausal recipients with and without endometriosis sharing sibling oocytes coming from the same oocyte donor.

In this retrospective study we report on success rates with the over-the-scope clip (OTSC) system in upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding in this high-risk patient population. Patients and methods Between February 2011 and June 2014, 75 patients were treated with an OTSC for active gastrointestinal bleeding. Success rates with the first endoscopic therapy, rebleeding episodes, their management and the influence of antithrombotic or anticoagulant therapy were analyzed retrospectively. Results Application of the OTSC resulted in immediate hemostasis (primary success rate) in all 75 patients. However, in 34.7 % a rebleeding episode was noted that could be treated by further endoscopic interventions. Only 3 patients had to be sent to the operating room because of failure of endoscopic therapy. In the rebleeding group the use of antiplatelet therapies was higher (73.1 % vs. 48.9 %). Conclusions Application of the OTSC in GI bleeding results in a high rate of primary hemostasis. Rebleeding occurs in up to 35 % of patients receiving antithrombotic/anticoagulant therapy but can be managed successfully with further endoscopic treatments. Patients in the rebleeding group were more frequently treated with antiplatelet agents.

Technical success, primary hemostasis, rebleeding, blood transfusion, hospital stay, and hemorrhage-related mortality rates were evaluated. Results  Data from 286 patients, with either UGIB (N = 214) or LGIB (N = 72) were available. Overall, 112 patients (39.2 %) were receiving antithrombotic therapy. Technical success and primary hemostasis rates were 97.9 % and 96.4 %, respectively. Early rebleeding occurred in 4.4 %, more frequently in those on antithrombotic therapy, and no late rebleeding was observed.

Patients and methods  Data on endoscopic treatment (first- vs. second-line) in PUB with OTSC and clinical data were analyzed. The primary outcome was the clinical success of hemostasis, defined as the absence of recurrent bleeding or further intervention. Secondary outcomes were factors associated with OTSC failure. Results  From April 2014 to March 2018, 100 patients (age 72 [20 - 98] y, female 36 %) with PUB in the stomach or the duodenum were treated endoscopically with the OTSC. The OTSC was used as a first-line procedure (primary-OTSC) in 66 pts. Successful hemostasis could be achieved in 90.9 %. After failure of an initial endoscopic treatment, 34 patients were treated with the OTSC (secondary-OTSC) and the treatment was successful in 94.1 %. Recurrent bleeding occurred in n = 10 for primary-OTSC (16.7 %) and in n = 7 pts in the secondary-OTSC (21.9 %) ( P  = 0.81). Clinical success in the primary-OTSC was 75.8 % and 73.5 % in the secondary-OTSC respectively. Conclusions  The OTSC has a high rate of initial bleeding control in first- and second line treatment of PUB. OTSC failure occurs more often in the duodenum than in the stomach and results in longer intensive care unit stay, higher amount of transfusions, and a higher reimbursement per case."

In this retrospective study we report on success rates with the over-the-scope clip (OTSC) system in upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding in this high-risk patient population. Patients and methods Between February 2011 and June 2014, 75 patients were treated with an OTSC for active gastrointestinal bleeding. Success rates with the first endoscopic therapy, rebleeding episodes, their management and the influence of antithrombotic or anticoagulant therapy were analyzed retrospectively. Results Application of the OTSC resulted in immediate hemostasis (primary success rate) in all 75 patients. However, in 34.7 % a rebleeding episode was noted that could be treated by further endoscopic interventions. Only 3 patients had to be sent to the operating room because of failure of endoscopic therapy. In the rebleeding group the use of antiplatelet therapies was higher (73.1 % vs. 48.9 %). Conclusions Application of the OTSC in GI bleeding results in a high rate of primary hemostasis. Rebleeding occurs in up to 35 % of patients receiving antithrombotic/anticoagulant therapy but can be managed successfully with further endoscopic treatments. Patients in the rebleeding group were more frequently treated with antiplatelet agents. Radiological or surgical therapy was reserved for a small subgroup not successfully managed by repeated endoscopic therapies.

The over-the-scope clip (OTSC) may overcome limitations of standard clips or thermocoagulation in high-risk bleeding lesions. We evaluate the main clinically relevant outcomes following endoscopic hemostasis with OTSC in high-risk lesions and/or patients. Patients and methods  This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected databases including all patients with UGIB and LGIB who underwent OTCS placement as first-line treatment in eleven tertiary endoscopic referral centers. Technical success, primary hemostasis, rebleeding, blood transfusion, hospital stay, and hemorrhage-related mortality rates were evaluated. Results  Data from 286 patients, with either UGIB (N = 214) or LGIB (N = 72) were available. Overall, 112 patients (39.2 %) were receiving antithrombotic therapy. Technical success and primary hemostasis rates were 97.9 % and 96.4 %, respectively. Early rebleeding occurred in 4.4 %, more frequently in those on antithrombotic therapy, and no late rebleeding was observed. Following a successful primary haemostasis, only 5.2 % patients needed blood transfusions, and the median hospital stay was 4 days (range: 3 - 11). Eighteen patients with either technical failure (N = 6) or rebleeding (N = 12) underwent radiological or surgical approaches. Overall, bleeding-related deaths occurred in 5 (1.7 %) patients, including 3 patients with technical procedural failure, and 2 in the rebleeding group.  Conclusions  Data from our large, multicenter study show that OTSC placement is an effective first-line treatment for hemostasis in high-risk patients and/or lesions both in upper and lower gastrointestinal tract.",

Patients and methods  Data on endoscopic treatment (first- vs. second-line) in PUB with OTSC and clinical data were analyzed. The primary outcome was the clinical success of hemostasis, defined as the absence of recurrent bleeding or further intervention. Secondary outcomes were factors associated with OTSC failure. Results  From April 2014 to March 2018, 100 patients (age 72 [20 - 98] y, female 36 %) with PUB in the stomach or the duodenum were treated endoscopically with the OTSC. The OTSC was used as a first-line procedure (primary-OTSC) in 66 pts. Successful hemostasis could be achieved in 90.9 %. After failure of an initial endoscopic treatment, 34 patients were treated with the OTSC (secondary-OTSC) and the treatment was successful in 94.1 %. Recurrent bleeding occurred in n = 10 for primary-OTSC (16.7 %) and in n = 7 pts in the secondary-OTSC (21.9 %) ( P  = 0.81). Clinical success in the primary-OTSC was 75.8 % and 73.5 % in the secondary-OTSC respectively. Conclusions  The OTSC has a high rate of initial bleeding control in first- and second line treatment of PUB. OTSC failure occurs more often in the duodenum than in the stomach and results in longer intensive care unit stay, higher amount of transfusions, and a higher reimbursement per case."

    "referenceConclusion": "The evidence is robust for a strongly elevated risk of tuberculosis with radiological silicosis, with a low disease severity threshold. The effect estimate is more uncertain for silica exposure without radiological silicosis. Research is needed, particularly cohort studies measuring silica exposure in different settings, to characterise the effect more accurately as well as the silica exposure threshold that could be used to prevent excess tuberculosis risk. The study provides to our knowledge the first systematic review of the epidemiological evidence for an association identified at least a century ago, viz. that occupational inhalation of silica dust increases the risk of pulmonary tuberculosis in co-exposed populations. In the current era, even with less severe forms of silicosis in traditional dusty industries, the evidence remains strong for a substantially elevated risk of tuberculosis in those with radiologically diagnosed disease. While there is evidence for an elevated risk of tuberculosis in those who have not been radiologically diagnosed with silicosis, the effect size is subject to uncertainty. Further studies are needed to characterise this effect, and particularly the exposure threshold that would avoid an excess risk of tuberculosis.",

For the 18-year follow-up period, the following groups had statistically significant increased standard incidence rates (SIR) for pulmonary tuberculosis: silicotics, SIR = 1000 (95% CI = 272 to 2561, P less than .01); nonsilicotics employed at least 25 years, SIR = 353 (95% CI = 130 to 768, P less than .01); and for the entire cohort, SIR = 201 (95% CI = 125 to 397, P = .01).

Two occupational categories were extracted--\"mining, tunneling, and quarrying\" (n = 284) and \"iron and steel foundries\" (n = 428), respectively. Control groups were drawn from a national register of persons undergoing periodic health examinations with regard to silicosis risk. The controls were matched for occupation, age, and time of first exposure. The follow-up was performed through record-linkage operations to computerized information in Swedish Death Statistics, Swedish Cancer Register, and the Swedish Tuberculosis Index. End of follow-up was set at December 31, 1980. In cases drawn from mining, quarrying, and tunneling workers seven deaths in lung cancer were observed and two among the controls. Among iron and steel foundry workers the corresponding numbers were 10 and 6. The values for expected numbers, based on general population statistics, were 1.3 and 2.6, respectively, for these two occupational groups. When cancer incidence statistics were used, the case/control ratio for lung cancer was 2.1 for \"mining, quarrying, and tunneling\" and 0.6 for \"iron and steel foundries.\" There were 29 cases of lung tuberculosis registered among the silicosis cases during the follow-up period. Only one tuberculosis case was observed among the controls. The results demonstrate that persons with silicosis contracted in the mining, quarrying, and tunneling occupations are subject to an increased risk of lung cancer. The risk is observed when both the general population and a closely matched control population from the same occupations are used for values of reference. The results also demonstrate the high risk of persons with silicosis to contract lung tuberculosis.",

In this study, a cohort of 1,153 older gold miners with and without silicosis who had not had tuberculosis have been followed for 7 yr by a routine mine surveillance program for detection of tuberculosis. One hundred seventy-eight of the men developed tuberculosis. The annual incidence of tuberculosis was 981/100,000 in the 335 men without silicosis and 2,707/100,000 in the 818 men with silicosis. The relative risk for tuberculosis was 2.8 (95% CI, 1.9 to 4.1) for men with silicosis compared with that in the men without silicosis. The incidence of tuberculosis increased from 1% per annum (pa) for the men without silicosis to 2.2% pa for the men with silicosis with Category 1 nodule profusion, 2.9% pa for those with Category 2, and 6.3% pa for those with Category 3 silicosis. This study has confirmed and quantified the high risk of pulmonary and of extrapulmonary tuberculosis in men with silicosis. The incidence of tuberculosis during this 7-yr study suggests that one quarter of these men with silicosis will have developed tuberculosis by 60 yr of age.",

      "# Title: Risk factors for pulmonary mycobacterial disease in South African gold miners. A case-control study.\n# Abstract: Pulmonary mycobacterial disease is common in miners. Risk factors for nontuberculous pulmonary mycobacterial (NTM) disease and tuberculosis (TB) in gold miners were identified in a retrospective case-control study that included 206 NTM patients and 381 TB patients of known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status diagnosed between 1993 and 1996. A total of 180 HIV-tested trauma/surgical inpatients were selected as control patients. Both HIV infection (odds ratio [OR] 3.6 for NTM and 4.5 for TB patients) and higher grades of silicosis (OR 5.0 for NTM and 4.9 for TB patients) were significantly more common in NTM and TB patients than in control patients. HIV prevalence rose in the control and both case groups during the study period. The overall HIV prevalence was 13.1% in NTM patients, 14.2% in TB patients, and 5.6% in control patients. Previous TB (OR 9.6), premorbid focal radiological scarring (OR 7.4) and a dusty job at diagnosis (OR 2.4) were additional significant risk factors for NTM disease. These findings suggest that the historically high incidence of NTM disease in miners is largely attributable to chronic chest disease from silica dust inhalation and prior TB. HIV infection has recently become an additional risk factor for mycobacterial disease in miners and is likely to become increasingly important as the HIV epidemic progresses.",

The risk of MTB infection relative to the general population was 4.5. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the independent risk factors for MTB infection in ESRD patients are old age (hazard ratio (HR) 1.17 per 10 years, p <0.001), male gender (HR 1.37, p <0.001), silicosis (HR 5.82, p <0.001), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 1.68, p 0.012).

This study investigated the usefulness of LSM as a predictor of HCC development in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). A total of 1,130 patients with non-biopsy-proven CHB who underwent LSM between May 2005 and December 2007 were enrolled in this prospective study. After LSM was performed, patients attended regular follow-up as part of a surveillance program for the detection of HCC. The mean age of the patients (767 men, 363 women) was 50.2 years, and the median LSM was 7.7 kPa. Six hundred seventy-two (59.5%) patients received antiviral treatment before or after enrollment. During the follow-up period (median, 30.7 months; range, 24.0-50.9 months), HCC developed in 57 patients (2.0% per 1 person-year).

We investigated the efficacy of the ELF test in predicting development of liver-related events (LREs) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). A total of 170 patients (103 men; 60.6%) with CHB who underwent LB and serological tests for determining ELFs were enrolled. All patients were followed up to monitor LRE development, defined as hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and/or liver-related death. The mean age was 45.3 years. During the follow-up period (median, 41 months), 39 (22.9%) patients experienced LREs. In patients with LREs, age, proportion of male gender, ELF test results, age-spleen-platelet ratio (ASPRI), liver stiffness (LS) value, and proportion of histological cirrhosis were significantly higher than those in patients without LREs (all P < 0.05). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves to predict LRE development were 0.808 for the ELF test, 0.732 for LS value, 0.713 for histological fibrosis stages using Batts and Ludwig's scoring system, and 0.687 for ASPRI. On multivariate analysis, along with age, the ELF test was an independent predictor of LRE development (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.438; P < 0.001). When we applied a three-tier stratification of our study population using cut-off ELF values of 8.10 and 10.40, patients with low (P = 0.002; adjusted HR: 0.045; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.006-0.330) and intermediate (P < 0.001; adjusted HR: 0.239; 95% CI: 0.122-0.469) ELF range were found less likely to develop LREs, compared to those with high ELF range.",

This study investigated whether transient elastography (TE) can identify patients with subclinical cirrhosis (SCC) who are at increased risk of developing HCC among chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients without clinical evidence of cirrhosis. A total of 2,876 CHB patients without clinical cirrhosis who received TE examinations between April 2006 and December 2012 were enrolled in this prospective study. SCC was defined as a nonclinical cirrhosis, but with a liver stiffness (LS) value ≥13 kilopascals (kPa). Mean age of the study population was 46.1 years, and male gender was predominant (n = 1,775; 61.7%). Mean LS value was 7.9 kPa, and SCC was identified in 285 (9.9%) patients. During the median follow-up period of 48.9 months (range, 6.6-96.2), HCC developed in 16 patients (13.3 per 1,000 person-years) in the SCC group and 36 (3.4 per 1,000 person-years) in the non-SCC group.

A total of 9300 patients with CHB who underwent US and TE in two institutions between 2006 and 2018 were enrolled. TE value ≥13 kPa was set to indicate cirrhosis. Patients were divided into four groups: US(+)TE(+) (cirrhosis by US and TE), US(+)TE(-) (cirrhosis by US, but not by TE), US(-)TE(+) (cirrhosis by TE, but not by US) and US(-)TE(-) (non-cirrhosis by US and TE).The patients were predominantly male (n = 5474, 58.9%) with a mean age of 47.5 years. The proportions of patients with cirrhosis diagnosed by US and TE were 17.2% (n = 1595) and 13.2% (n = 1225), respectively. The proportion of patients with discordant results in diagnosing cirrhosis by US and TE was 18.7% (n = 1740).

      "# Title: Risk assessment of hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma development using liver stiffness measurement (FibroScan).\n# Abstract: Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using FibroScan accurately assesses the degree of liver fibrosis and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in patients with chronic hepatitis C. This study investigated the usefulness of LSM as a predictor of HCC development in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). A total of 1,130 patients with non-biopsy-proven CHB who underwent LSM between May 2005 and December 2007 were enrolled in this prospective study. After LSM was performed, patients attended regular follow-up as part of a surveillance program for the detection of HCC. The mean age of the patients (767 men, 363 women) was 50.2 years, and the median LSM was 7.7 kPa. Six hundred seventy-two (59.5%) patients received antiviral treatment before or after enrollment. During the follow-up period (median, 30.7 months; range, 24.0-50.9 months), HCC developed in 57 patients (2.0% per 1 person-year). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year cumulative incidence rates of HCC were 0.80%, 3.26%, and 5.98%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, together with old age, male sex, heavy alcohol consumption (>80 g/day), serum albumin, and hepatitis B e antigen positivity, patients with a higher LSM (>8 kPa) were at a significantly greater risk of HCC development, with the following hazard ratios: 3.07 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-9.31; P = 0.047) for LSM 8.1-13 kPa; 4.68 (95% CI, 1.40-15.64; P = 0.012) for LSM 13.1-18 kPa; 5.55 (95% CI, 1.53-20.04; P = 0.009) for LSM 18.1-23 kPa; and 6.60 (95% CI, 1.83-23.84; P = 0.004) for LSM >23 kPa.",

      "# Title: Risk assessment of clinical outcomes in Asian patients with chronic hepatitis B using enhanced liver fibrosis test.\n# Abstract: Serum fibrosis markers, such as the enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) test, have been suggested as alternatives for liver biopsy (LB) in assessing liver fibrosis. We investigated the efficacy of the ELF test in predicting development of liver-related events (LREs) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). A total of 170 patients (103 men; 60.6%) with CHB who underwent LB and serological tests for determining ELFs were enrolled. All patients were followed up to monitor LRE development, defined as hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and/or liver-related death. The mean age was 45.3 years. During the follow-up period (median, 41 months), 39 (22.9%) patients experienced LREs. In patients with LREs, age, proportion of male gender, ELF test results, age-spleen-platelet ratio (ASPRI), liver stiffness (LS) value, and proportion of histological cirrhosis were significantly higher than those in patients without LREs (all P < 0.05). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves to predict LRE development were 0.808 for the ELF test, 0.732 for LS value, 0.713 for histological fibrosis stages using Batts and Ludwig's scoring system, and 0.687 for ASPRI. On multivariate analysis, along with age, the ELF test was an independent predictor of LRE development (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.438; P < 0.001). When we applied a three-tier stratification of our study population using cut-off ELF values of 8.10 and 10.40, patients with low (P = 0.002; adjusted HR: 0.045; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.006-0.330) and intermediate (P < 0.001; adjusted HR: 0.239; 95% CI: 0.122-0.469) ELF range were found less likely to develop LREs, compared to those with high ELF range.",
      "# Title: Increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic hepatitis B patients with transient elastography-defined subclinical cirrhosis.\n# Abstract: Early detection of liver cirrhosis in its subclinical stage is of paramount importance to identify high-risk individuals for developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study investigated whether transient elastography (TE) can identify patients with subclinical cirrhosis (SCC) who are at increased risk of developing HCC among chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients without clinical evidence of cirrhosis. A total of 2,876 CHB patients without clinical cirrhosis who received TE examinations between April 2006 and December 2012 were enrolled in this prospective study. SCC was defined as a nonclinical cirrhosis, but with a liver stiffness (LS) value ≥13 kilopascals (kPa). Mean age of the study population was 46.1 years, and male gender was predominant (n = 1,775; 61.7%). Mean LS value was 7.9 kPa, and SCC was identified in 285 (9.9%) patients. During the median follow-up period of 48.9 months (range, 6.6-96.2), HCC developed in 16 patients (13.3 per 1,000 person-years) in the SCC group and 36 (3.4 per 1,000 person-years) in the non-SCC group. Cumulative incidence rate of HCC in the SCC group was significantly higher than that in the non-SCC group (P < 0.001, log-rank test). On multivariate analysis, SCC was independently associated with a risk of developing HCC, regardless of antiviral therapy (without antiviral therapy: hazard ratio [HR]: 4.680; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.187-18.441; P = 0.027; with antiviral therapy: HR, 3.344; 95% CI: 1.526-7.328; P = 0.003).",
