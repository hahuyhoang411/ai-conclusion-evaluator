      "sourcePaperId": 35280900,
      "referenceConclusion": "In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggested that a higher dose of rifampin could significantly increase the pharmacokinetic parameters containing plasma and CSF concentration and the plasma AUC 0−24 , without a remarkable increase of adverse reactions. This phenomenon may indicate the idea that the crucial drug in the antituberculosis regimen was used in a low dose, more studies are required to shed light on this question. However, we found that there was no improvement in the treatment outcome. In terms of efficacy, more work will need to be done, especially large sample size phase III studies to determine the effect of an intensified regimen including a higher dose of rifampin.",

        "# Title: Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Phase II Dose-Finding Study To Evaluate High-Dose Rifampin for Tuberculous Meningitis.\n# Abstract: High doses of rifampin may help patients with tuberculous meningitis (TBM) to survive. Pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic evaluations suggested that rifampin doses higher than 13 mg/kg given intravenously or 20 mg/kg given orally (as previously studied) are warranted to maximize treatment response. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase II trial, we assigned 60 adult TBM patients in Bandung, Indonesia, to standard 450 mg, 900 mg, or 1,350 mg (10, 20, and 30 mg/kg) oral rifampin combined with other TB drugs for 30 days. The endpoints included pharmacokinetic measures, adverse events, and survival. A double and triple dose of oral rifampin led to 3- and 5-fold higher geometric mean total exposures in plasma in the critical early days (2 ± 1) of treatment (area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h [AUC0-24], 53.5 mg · h/liter versus 170.6 mg · h/liter and 293.5 mg · h/liter, respectively; P < 0.001), with proportional increases in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations and without an increase in the incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events. The 6-month mortality was 7/20 (35%), 9/20 (45%), and 3/20 (15%) in the 10-, 20-, and 30-mg/kg groups, respectively (P = 0.12). A tripling of the standard dose caused a large increase in rifampin exposure in plasma and CSF and was safe. The survival benefit with this dose should now be evaluated in a larger phase III clinical trial. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under identifier NCT02169882.).",
        "# Title: Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Intensive Antituberculosis Treatment of Tuberculous Meningitis.\n# Abstract: The most effective antituberculosis drug treatment regimen for tuberculous meningitis is uncertain. We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing standard treatment with a regimen intensified by rifampin 15 mg/kg and levofloxacin for the first 60 days. The intensified regimen did not improve survival or any other outcome. We therefore conducted a nested pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study in 237 trial participants to define exposure-response relationships that might explain the trial results and improve future therapy. Rifampin 15 mg/kg increased plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) exposures compared with 10 mg/kg: day 14 exposure increased from 48.2 hour·mg/L (range 18.2-93.8) to 82.5 hour·mg/L (range 8.7-161.0) in plasma and from 3.5 hour·mg/L (range 1.2-9.6) to 6.0 hour·mg/L (range 0.7-15.1) in CSF. However, there was no relationship between rifampin exposure and survival. In contrast, we found that isoniazid exposure was associated with survival, with low exposure predictive of death, and was linked to a fast metabolizer phenotype. Higher doses of isoniazid should be investigated, especially in fast metabolizers.",

        "# Title: Plasma Pharmacokinetics of High-Dose Oral versus Intravenous Rifampicin in Patients with Tuberculous Meningitis: a Randomized Controlled Trial.\n# Abstract: Higher doses of intravenous rifampicin may improve outcomes in tuberculous meningitis but are impractical in high-burden settings. We hypothesized that plasma rifampicin exposures would be similar between oral dosing of 35 mg/kg of body weight and intravenous dosing of 20 mg/kg, which has been proposed for efficacy trials in tuberculous meningitis. We performed a randomized parallel-group pharmacokinetic study nested within a clinical trial of intensified antimicrobial therapy for tuberculous meningitis. HIV-positive participants with tuberculous meningitis were recruited from South African hospitals and randomized to one of three rifampicin dosing groups: standard (oral 10 mg/kg), high dose (oral 35 mg/kg), and intravenous (20 mg/kg). Intensive pharmacokinetic sampling was done on day 3. Data were described using noncompartmental analysis, and exposures were compared by geometric mean ratios (GMRs). Forty-six participants underwent pharmacokinetic sampling (standard dose, n = 17; high-dose oral, n = 15; intravenous, n = 14). The median CD4 count was 130 cells/mm3 (interquartile range [IQR], 66 to 253 cells/mm3). The rifampicin geometric mean area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC0-24) values were 42.9 μg · h/ml (95% confidence interval [CI], 24.5 to 75.0 μg · h/ml) for the standard dose, 295.2 μg · h/ml (95% CI, 189.9 to 458.8 μg · h/ml) for the high oral dose, and 206.5 μg · h/ml (95% CI, 154.6 to 275.8 μg · h/ml) for intravenous administration. The rifampicin AUC0-24 GMR was 1.44 (90% CI, 0.84 to 2.21) and the maximal concentration of drug in serum (Cmax) GMR was 0.89 (90% CI, 0.63 to 1.23) for high-dose oral administration with respect to intravenous dosing. The plasma rifampicin AUC0-24 was higher after an oral 35-mg/kg dose than with intravenous administration at a 20-mg/kg dose over the first few days of tuberculosis (TB) treatment. The findings support oral rifampicin dosing in future tuberculous meningitis trials."

Twenty children on dialysis intended to perform a 12-week graded community-based exercise program. Exercise capacity and fatigue level were studied; muscle force and health-related quality of life were secondary outcomes. All outcomes were measured at baseline (T = 0) and after intervention (T = 1). Fourteen of the 20 patients (70%) either did not start the program or did not complete the program. Of these patients, seven did not complete or even start the exercise program because of a combination of lack of time and motivational problems. Six patients were not able to continue the program or were unable to do the follow-up measurements because of medical problems. Exercise capacity and muscle strength was higher after the exercise program in the children who completed the training. In conclusion, exercise training is difficult to perform in children with ESRD and is not always feasible in real-life situations for many children with ESRD.",

The aim of this study was to determine if twice-weekly exercise for 1 h during HD could improve exercise capacity in children receiving HD. We assessed lower extremity strength (Biodex; dominant extension peak torque in 60 degrees per second, Newton-meters), grip strength (dynanometer, kilogram) and 6-min walk capacity (yards) in ten children (median age 13.6 years, range 8-25 years) at baseline and after 3 months of twice weekly exercise for 1 h during HD. Baseline assessment revealed a mean (1) Biodex of 70 +/- 32 N-m/s, (2) 6-m walk test of 589 +/- 90 yards and (3) grip strength of 23.2 +/- 10 kg, which were 50% lower than the normal value for healthy controls. Patients demonstrated significant improvements in lower extremity strength and 6-min walk test after 3 months of exercise. Our data show that twice-weekly exercise of a moderate intensity during HD can lead to exercise capacity improvement in 3 months. We identified barriers to and strategies for the successful implementation of intradialytic exercise. We suggest that intradialytic exercise intervention may be effective to improve exercise capacity in children receiving maintenance HD.",

Aerobic, strengthening exercises, and exergames are reported as effective in the treatment of symptoms associated with CKD. Unlike adult patients, there are insufficient studies investigating the effects of exercise on disease-related symptoms in pediatric CKD. This study aimed to compare the effects of Nintendo Wii-based exergaming and home-based fun video exercises on functional capacity, muscle strength, physical activity (PA), depression, fatigue, and QoL in pediatric patients with CKD. Twenty-three pediatric patients with CKD were included in the study and randomized to group I (Nintendo Wii Fit) and group II (home-based fun video exercises). Patients in both groups underwent exercise programs twice per week for 6 weeks. Functional capacity, muscle strength, PA, QoL, fatigue, and depression of the patients were evaluated before and after the treatments. Sixteen patients completed the study. After treatment, significant differences were observed in both groups on 6MWT, muscle strength, average daily steps, PedsQoL Child Self-Report PHSS, and the Visual Fatigue Scale. Left knee flexor muscle strength and average step counts were found to be superior in group I. Both exergaming and home-based fun video exercises provide positive effects on functional capacity, muscle strength, fatigue, PA, depression, and QoL in pediatric patients with CKD. We think that these exercise methods can help to protect physical and mental health of patients and should be included in treatment from the early stages of the disease."

The two most commonly used autogenous grafts are the central third of the patellar tendon and the hamstring tendon constructs. The choice of different grafts and different construct influence the final clinical outcome of ACL reconstruction. The 3 groups, of 25 patients each, were generated by choosing the technique (PT tendon, 4 strand hamstring, and single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty) to utilize and followed for 5 years, with an alternate systematic sampling. Our comparison has shown significant kneeling pain in the patellar tendon with respect to the groups with hamstrings techniques. Single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty achieved subjective score significantly higher with respect to the other two groups as well as for the time to resume sport. The study confirms that patellar tendon and hamstring can be equivalent options for ACL reconstruction. This study demonstrated that a superior outcome as far as subjective clinical findings were concerned, was obtained in group III. Patients in the latter group were also able to return to sports sooner than those in the bone-patellar tendon graft group and the four-strand hamstring group.",

Fifty patients who underwent ACLR with versus without ALLR were analyzed at four different time points (preoperatively and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively). For the functional outcomes, muscle strength and acceleration time (AT) were measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. Proprioception was evaluated using joint position sense and dynamic postural stability. Patient-reported outcomes were measured using the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK-11) scores. Functional performance was assessed using single-leg hop distance (SLHD) and Limb Symmetry Index. In the operated knees, quadriceps (at 6 months postoperatively, p = 0.003) and hamstring (at 6 and 12 months postoperatively, p < 0.001) strength were significantly higher in the combined ACLR and ALLR group than the isolated ACLR group.

      "referenceConclusion": "The complete explanation of the genomic background behind melanoma pathogenesis remains elusive. This study presents a summary of current understanding regarding the clonal relatedness of mutated genes in primary cutaneous melanoma and matched tumors. We draw attention to the knowledge gap regarding the genetic heterogeneity of melanoma-specific genes, which could serve as a valuable tool in identifying suitable patients for trials testing possible new targeted therapies. Furthermore, we found that CM presents a significant concordance in BRAF status between primary and metastatic tumors than in previous meta-analyses, probably due to technical advances, although a minority of patients showed inconsistencies. Therefore, we propose that molecular testing in metastatic tissue is a more appropriate method for determining BRAF status to tailor the treatment decision, although it is still reasonable to use the primary tumor in cases of difficulty. Further research should investigate the factors causing these discrepancies and the feasibility of using other molecular markers with BRAF status to better stratify patients for melanoma treatment.",

        "# Title: Intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity of BRAF(V600E))mutations in primary and metastatic melanoma.\n# Abstract: The rationale for using small molecule inhibitors of oncogenic proteins as cancer therapies depends, at least in part, on the assumption that metastatic tumors are primarily clonal with respect to mutant oncogene. With the emergence of BRAF(V600E) as a therapeutic target, we investigated intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity in melanoma using detection of the BRAF(V600E) mutation as a marker of clonality. BRAF mutant-specific PCR (MS-PCR) and conventional sequencing were performed on 112 tumors from 73 patients, including patients with matched primary and metastatic specimens (n = 18). Nineteen patients had tissues available from multiple metastatic sites. Mutations were detected in 36/112 (32%) melanomas using conventional sequencing, and 85/112 (76%) using MS-PCR. The better sensitivity of the MS-PCR to detect the mutant BRAF(V600E) allele was not due to the presence of contaminating normal tissue, suggesting that the tumor was comprised of subclones of differing BRAF genotypes. To determine if tumor subclones were present in individual primary melanomas, we performed laser microdissection and mutation detection via sequencing and BRAF(V600E)-specific SNaPshot analysis in 9 cases. Six of these cases demonstrated differing proportions of BRAF(V600E)and BRAF(wild-type) cells in distinct microdissected regions within individual tumors. Additional analyses of multiple metastatic samples from individual patients using the highly sensitive MS-PCR without microdissection revealed that 5/19 (26%) patients had metastases that were discordant for the BRAF(V600E) mutation. In conclusion, we used highly sensitive BRAF mutation detection methods and observed substantial evidence for heterogeneity of the BRAF(V600E) mutation within individual melanoma tumor specimens, and among multiple specimens from individual patients. Given the varied clinical responses of patients to BRAF inhibitor therapy, these data suggest that additional studies to determine possible associations between clinical outcomes and intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity could prove fruitful.",

        "# Title: Discordancy in BRAF mutations among primary and metastatic melanoma lesions: clinical implications for targeted therapy.\n# Abstract: Systemic targeted molecular therapy, in the form of a selective BRAF inhibitor with or without a MEK inhibitor, is a standard treatment for patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma with unresectable stage III and IV disease. Patients with BRAF mutation-negative primary tumors may manifest BRAF mutation-positive metastatic disease. It is unclear whether all metastatic lesions carry the same BRAF mutation status found in the primary tumor and if discordancy exists, in what frequency it occurs. Primary and matched metastatic lesions in 25 melanoma patients were tested for the BRAF V600E/Ec, V600K, V600D, and V600R mutations using a BRAF RGQ PCR kit (Qiagen). Four patients (16%) had discrepancies between their primary and metastatic melanoma BRAF status. Of these patients, 2 (8%) had BRAF mutation-positive primary melanomas with BRAF mutation-negative metastatic lesions and 2 (8%) patient had BRAF mutation-negative melanoma with a BRAF mutation-positive metastatic lesion. In summary, discordancy of BRAF mutation status is not an infrequent finding between primary and metastatic melanoma. It may be prudent in previously negative patients to determine BRAF mutation status of new metastatic tumors for proper allocation of BRAF inhibitor therapy. Discordant BRAF status may have a role in the varying patterns of response and inevitable resistance seen with BRAF inhibitor therapies.",

Nevertheless, BRAF oncogene mutation status between different samples from the same patient has been studied with conflicting results. This study investigated the intrapatient homogeneity of BRAF mutation status using pyrosequencing in primary tumors and different metastatic sites of melanoma patients. Paired samples of lymphatic, visceral, and subcutaneous metastases and primary melanoma from 45 metastatic melanoma patients were tested for BRAF mutations using a pyrosequencing assay and by Sanger sequencing. Overall, sequencing for BRAF mutation status was performed in 114 paired samples from 45 patients. Eighteen patients (40%) carried a BRAF mutation, including BRAF V600E (12/18), BRAF V600K (5/18), and BRAF V600R (1/18) mutations. Multiple BRAF mutations (V600E and V600K) were found in one patient. Among the patients with BRAF mutations, a good agreement in BRAF mutation status was found between the first and second tumor samples genotyped (91%; Cohen's κ coefficient: 0.81). Discordance in BRAF mutation status was found only in four patients, involving all three patients in whom sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases were sampled. These SLNs exhibited a wild-type genotype and were discordant with the other BRAF-mutated samples found in the same patient. The intrapatient BRAF status was predominantly homogeneous. However, SLN genotyping using pyrosequencing might be inaccurate in determining the actual mutation status of melanoma. Further studies are required to confirm the lack of reliability of SLN.",

Treatment with BRAFV600 inhibitors has improved overall and disease-free survival in metastatic melanoma patients whose tumors harbor BRAFV600 mutations. Although the BRAFV600E mutation appears to have a critical role in tumor initiation, its expression during tumor progression remains controversial. In fact, various authors claim that BRAFV600E heterogeneity is evident in melanoma tumors. Herein, we investigated the pattern of BRAFV600E expression in matched primary and metastatic samples from 140 patients. Using a combination of real-time PCR and immunohistochemical analyses, we demonstrated that BRAFV600E expression is homogeneous in melanoma tumors and hypothesized that the heterogeneity described by others might be attributable to technical issues when molecular methods are used.

BRAF mutation frequency ranges from 40 to 60% depending on melanoma clinical characteristics and detection technique used.Intertumoral heterogeneity could lead to misinterpretation of BRAF mutational status; this is especially important if testing is performed on primary specimens, when metastatic lesions are unavailable.Aim of this study was to identify the best combination of methods for detecting BRAF mutations (among peptide nucleic acid - PNA-clamping real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and capillary sequencing) and investigate BRAF mutation heterogeneity in a series of 100 primary melanomas and a subset of 25 matched metastatic samples.Overall, we obtained a BRAF mutation frequency of 62%, based on the combination of at least two techniques. Concordance between mutation status in primary and metastatic tumor was good but not complete (67%), when agreement of at least two techniques were considered. Next generation sequencing was used to quantify the threshold of detected mutant alleles in discordant samples. Combining different methods excludes that the observed heterogeneity is technique-based. We propose an algorithm for BRAF mutation testing based on agreement between immunohistochemistry and PNA; a third molecular method could be added in case of discordance of the results. Testing the primary tumor when the metastatic sample is unavailable is a good option if at least two methods of detection are used, however the presence of intertumoral heterogeneity or the occurrence of additional primaries should be carefully considered.",

Between 40% and 60% of melanomas demonstrate BRAF mutations, BRAF V600E being most common. Selective BRAF inhibitor therapy has shown improvement in outcome in patients with melanoma. It has been demonstrated that not all metastatic lesions carry the same BRAF mutation status as the primary, but the frequency in which discordance occurs remains unclear. Establishing this may have implications in the use of BRAF inhibitors in patients with melanoma brain metastases.Patients who underwent metastectomy for melanoma brain metastases were identified using our local histopathology database. A review of histology of the primary lesion and the metastasis was performed for each patient, assessing for BRAF mutation status discordance.Fourty-two patients who underwent a brain metastectomy following excision of a melanoma primary were identified over a 7-year period. Median survival was 9 months. The median Breslow thickness for the primary lesion was 3.4 mm. Six patients (14%) had discrepancy between the BRAF status of a melanoma primary and metastatic lesion. Of these 6 patients, 3 had a BRAF mutation positive primary with a BRAF mutation negative metastatic lesion, while the other 3 had a BRAF mutation negative primary with BRAF mutation positive metastasis.There is an important discordance rate in the BRAF mutation status of melanoma primaries versus brain metastases.",
        "# Title: Concordance of somatic mutation profiles (BRAF,NRAS, and TERT) and tumoral PD-L1 in matched primary cutaneous and metastatic melanoma samples.\n# Abstract: Despite the efficacy of BRAF-targeted and PD-L1-related immune therapies in tackling metastatic melanoma, a significant number of patients exhibit resistance. Given this, the objective of the current study was to ascertain concordance of somatic mutations in BRAF/NRAS/TERT and immunohistochemical PD-L1 and CD8 in matched primary cutaneous and metastatic melanoma. A total of 43 archival paired samples with sufficient material for genetic and immunohistochemical analyses met the criteria for inclusion in the study. Immunohistochemistry was performed for PD-L1 and CD8 and direct-DNA Sanger sequencing for BRAF/NRAS/TERT promoter mutational analyses. Agreement between paired samples was assessed using Cohen κ. Poor concordance among primary and corresponding metastases was noted in BRAF (9/42 cases discordant, κ = 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.77; P = .0013), TERT promoter mutations (13/41 cases discordant, κ = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.04-0.62; P = .033), tumoral PD-L1 immunoexpression (9/43 cases discordant, κ = 0.39; 95% CI, 0.07-0.72; P = .0099), and immunoexpression of CD8+ T lymphocytes (12/43 cases discordant, κ = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.19-0.69; P = .002). Although NRAS1 and NRAS2 were highly concordant (42/43 and 39/43 cases, respectively), discordant NRAS2 mutational status was associated with a median time to metastasis of 90 versus 455 days for pairs with concordant status (P = .07).

        "# Title: Immunohistochemical and Molecular Features of Melanomas Exhibiting Intratumor and Intertumor Histomorphologic Heterogeneity.\n# Abstract: Melanoma is a heterogeneous neoplasm at the histomorphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular levels. Melanoma with extreme histomorphologic heterogeneity can pose a diagnostic challenge in which the diagnosis may predominantly rely on its immunophenotypic profile. However, tumor survival and response to therapy are linked to tumor genetic heterogeneity rather than tumor morphology. Therefore, understating the molecular characteristics of such melanomas become indispensable. In this study, DNA was extracted from 11 morphologically distinct regions in eight formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded melanomas. In each region, mutations in 50 cancer-related genes were tested using next-generation sequencing (NGS). A tumor was considered genetically heterogeneous if at least one non-overlapping mutation was identified either between the histologically distinct regions of the same tumor (intratumor heterogeneity) or among the histologically distinct regions of the paired primary and metastatic tumors within the same patient (intertumor heterogeneity). Our results revealed that genetic heterogeneity existed in all tumors as non-overlapping mutations were detected in every tested tumor (n = 5, 100%; intratumor: n = 2, 40%; intertumor: n = 3, 60%). Conversely, overlapping mutations were also detected in all the tested regions (n = 11, 100%). Melanomas exhibiting histomorphologic heterogeneity are often associated with genetic heterogeneity, which might contribute to tumor survival and poor response to therapy.",

We conducted a retrospective review of our acral melanoma patients. Of the 196 patients with acral melanoma, we retrieved 31 pairs of primary and matched metastatic melanomas. We immunostained the 31 pairs with VE1, a BRAFV600E-mutation-specific monoclonal antibody. Immunohistochemistry with VE1 showed a high degree of sensitivity and specificity for detecting BRAFV600E mutations compared with the real-time polymerase chain reaction method. A total of nine primary (29.0%) and eight metastatic (25.8%) acral melanomas were positive for VE1. In three patients (9.7%), we observed a discordance of VE1 staining between the primary and metastatic lesions. Of note, VE1 immunohistochemical staining revealed a remarkable degree of intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity in acral melanoma. Our study reveals that VE1 immunostaining is a useful ancillary method for detecting BRAFV600E mutations in acral melanoma and allows for a clear visualization of intra- and inter-tumor BRAF heterogeneity.",
        "# Title: TERT, BRAF, and NRAS Mutational Heterogeneity between Paired Primary and Metastatic Melanoma Tumors.\n# Abstract: Mutational heterogeneity can contribute to therapeutic resistance in solid cancers. In melanoma, the frequencies of intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity are controversial. We examined mutational heterogeneity within individual patients with melanoma using multiplatform analysis of commonly mutated driver and nonpassenger genes. We analyzed paired primary and metastatic tumors from 60 patients and multiple metastatic tumors from 39 patients whose primary tumors were unavailable (n = 271 tumors). We used a combination of multiplex SNaPshot assays, Sanger sequencing, mutation-specific PCR, or droplet digital PCR to determine the presence of BRAFV600, NRASQ61, TERT-124C>T, and TERT-146C>T mutations. Mutations were detected in BRAF (39%), NRAS (21%), and/or TERT (78%). Thirteen patients had TERTmutant discordant tumors; seven of these had a single tumor with both TERT-124C>T and TERT-146C>T mutations present at different allele frequencies. Two patients had both BRAF and NRAS mutations; one had different tumors and the other had a single tumor with both mutations. One patient with a BRAFmutant primary lacked mutant BRAF in at least one of their metastases. Overall, we identified mutational heterogeneity in 18 of 99 patients (18%). These results suggest that some primary melanomas may be composed of subclones with differing mutational profiles. Such heterogeneity may be relevant to treatment responses and survival outcomes."

        "conclusionA": "Genetic concordance between primary cutaneous melanoma and its metastases is a complex phenomenon significantly impacting treatment response: **while initial concordance, particularly in tumor mutational burden (TMB), correlates with improved outcomes for both targeted BRAF/MEK inhibition and immunotherapy, discordance – often driven by the emergence of resistance mutations or loss of heterozygosity – frequently predicts diminished treatment efficacy and can be dynamically monitored using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to inform adaptive therapeutic strategies.**",
        "conclusionB": "Despite generally high concordance, significant discordance in BRAF mutation status—occurring in 8% to 40% of patients depending on the study and methodology—is observed between primary melanomas and their metastases, highlighting the potential for inaccurate treatment allocation and the need to re-evaluate mutation status in metastatic disease, particularly when initial testing was negative or when response to BRAF inhibitor therapy is suboptimal."

Discard rates for SCDs were ascertained. The relative risk of graft loss was similar for recipients of SCD kidneys with sCr of 1.6-2.0 and >2.0 mg/dL, compared to </=1.5 mg/dL. For ECD recipients, the relative risk of graft failure significantly increased with increasing sCr. Of potential SCDs, the adjusted risk of discard was higher with sCr >2.0 mg/dL (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 7.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.5-7.6) and 1.6-2.0 mg/dL (AOR 2.7; CI 2.5-2.9) relative to sCr </=1.5 mg/dL.

We performed a multicenter study to determine associations of AKI (increasing admission-to-terminal serum creatinine by AKI Network stages) with kidney discard, delayed graft function (DGF) and 6-month estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). In 1632 donors, kidney discard risk increased for AKI stages 1, 2 and 3 (compared to no AKI) with adjusted relative risks of 1.28 (1.08-1.52), 1.82 (1.45-2.30) and 2.74 (2.0-3.75), respectively. Adjusted relative risk for DGF also increased by donor AKI stage: 1.27 (1.09-1.49), 1.70 (1.37-2.12) and 2.25 (1.74-2.91), respectively. Six-month eGFR, however, was similar across AKI categories but was lower for recipients with DGF (48 [interquartile range: 31-61] vs. 58 [45-75] ml/min/1.73m(2) for no DGF, p < 0.001). There was significant favorable interaction between donor AKI and DGF such that 6-month eGFR was progressively better for DGF kidneys with increasing donor AKI (46 [29-60], 49 [32-64], 52 [36-59] and 58 [39-71] ml/min/1.73m(2) for no AKI, stage 1, 2 and 3, respectively; interaction p = 0.05).

We included all patients who received deceased donor kidney transplant from June 2004 to October 2013. There were 162 AKI donor transplant recipients (21% of deceased donor transplants): 139 in the standard criteria donor (SCD) and 23 in the expanded criteria donor (ECD) cohort. 71% of the AKI donors had stage 3 (severe AKI), based on acute kidney injury network (AKIN) staging. Protocol biopsies were done at 1, 4, and 12 months posttransplant. One and four month formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies from 48 patients (24 AKI donors, 24 non-AKI) underwent global gene expression profiling using DNA microarrays (96 arrays). DGF was more common in the AKI group but eGFR, graft survival at 1 year and proportion with IF/TA>2 at 1 year were similar for the two groups. At 1 month, there were 898 differentially expressed genes in the AKI group (p-value <0.005; FDR <10%), but by 4 months there were no differences. Transplanting selected kidneys from deceased donors with AKI is safe and has excellent outcomes.",

To determine whether this policy is justified, we analyzed outcomes of donor kidneys with acute kidney injury (AKI) in a large UK cohort. A retrospective analysis of the UK Transplant Registry evaluated deceased donors between 2003 and 2013. Donors were classified as no AKI, or AKI stage 1-3 according to Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Relationship of AKI with delayed graft function/primary nonfunction (DGF/PNF), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and graft-survival at 90 days and 1 year was analyzed. There were 11 219 kidneys (1869 [17%] with AKI) included. Graft failure at 1 year is greater for donors with AKI than for those without (graft survival 89% vs. 91%, p = 0.02; odds ratio (OR) 1.20 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.41]). DGF rates increase with donor AKI stage (p < 0.005), and PNF rates are significantly higher for AKIN stage 3 kidneys (9% vs. 4%, p = 0.04) Analysis of association between AKI and recipient eGFR suggests a risk of inferior eGFR with AKI versus no AKI (p < 0.005; OR 1.25 [95% CI: 1.08-1.31]). We report a small reduction in 1-year graft-survival of kidneys from donors with AKI. We conclude that AKI stage 1 or 2 kidneys should be used; however, caution is advised for AKI stage 3 donors.",

We aimed to evaluate the impact of donors' AKI severity and trend on graft outcomes in DDK transplantation. This was a retrospective study of DDK transplantation performed from 2005 to 2014. Based on maximum and terminal serum creatinine values before transplantation, the AKI trends were categorized as improving or worsening. Of 413 DDKs, 275 developed AKI: 177 stage 1, 52 stage 2, and 46 stage 3. DDKs with AKI had 212 improving AKI and 63 worsening AKI. Graft outcomes were similar based on AKI stage. Worsening AKI did not affect delayed graft function development; however, it significantly elevated graft failure risk even after adjusting for AKI stage and Kidney Donor Risk Index. Graft survival of the improving group was similar to DDKs with no AKI. This study showed that AKI severity of DDKs did not affect overall graft outcomes. Notably, DDKs with improving AKI showed a similar graft survival rate to DDKs without AKI, although worsening AKI had a worse prognosis. Consideration of the AKI trend, rather than its severity, is needed when DDKs with AKI are allocated.",
        "# Title: Deceased-donor acute kidney injury is not associated with kidney allograft failure.\n# Abstract: Deceased-donor acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with organ discard and delayed graft function, but data on longer-term allograft survival are limited. We performed a multicenter study to determine associations between donor AKI (from none to severe based on AKI Network stages) and all-cause graft failure, adjusting for donor, transplant, and recipient factors. We examined whether any of the following factors modified the relationship between donor AKI and graft survival: kidney donor profile index, cold ischemia time, donation after cardiac death, expanded-criteria donation, kidney machine perfusion, donor-recipient gender combinations, or delayed graft function. We also evaluated the association between donor AKI and a 3-year composite outcome of all-cause graft failure or estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 in a subcohort of 30% of recipients. Among 2,430 kidneys transplanted from 1,298 deceased donors, 585 (24%) were from donors with AKI. Over a median follow-up of 4.0 years, there were no significant differences in graft survival by donor AKI stage. We found no evidence that pre-specified variables modified the effect of donor AKI on graft survival. In the subcohort, donor AKI was not associated with the 3-year composite outcome. Donor AKI was not associated with graft failure in this well-phenotyped cohort. Given the organ shortage, the transplant community should consider measures to increase utilization of kidneys from deceased donors with AKI.",
        "# Title: Success of kidney transplantations from deceased donors with acute kidney injury.\n# Abstract: BACKGROUND The acceptance of organs from deceased donors with acute kidney injury (AKI) varies considerably, with uncertain outcomes. The current organ shortage has led to increased use of marginal donor organs. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective, single-center study included 642 patients who underwent kidney allograft transplantation between 2005 and 2016. The recipients were categorized into 3 groups: AKI-1 (n=214), comprising donors with a peak serum creatinine (SCr) level of 1.1-2.0 mg/dl; AKI-2 (n=89), comprising donors with a peak SCr level >2 mg/dl; and non-AKI (n=339), comprising donors with normal kidney function (SCr <1.1 mg/dl). RESULTS The cumulative survival rates for patients and grafts did not significantly differ among the AKI-1, AKI-2, and non-AKI groups at the 1-year (91.6%/79.4%, 92.1%/83.1%, 95.3%/88.5%, respectively) and 5-year assessments (79.4%/67.8%, 86.8%/71.7%, 80.5%/71.1%, respectively). These findings were corroborated by mean SCr values and estimated glomerular filtration rates at the 1-year (2.08±1.7/51.16±23.45, 2.01±1.52/56.46±23.63, 1.81±1.13/55.44±23.26 mg/dl, respectively) and 5-year assessments (1.91±1.28/51.06±24.65, 1.74±0.66/57.44±31.21, 1.7±0.88/58.56±26.04 mg/dl, respectively). The incidence of delayed graft function in each group was 29.9%, 44.9%, and 28.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Kidney transplantation from donors with AKI, although associated with a higher rate of delayed graft function, results in good long-term transplant survival and reliable kidney functionality after 5 years. The inclusion of donors with AKI may widely extend the pool of available organs; however, careful donor selection is necessary.",

We investigated the effect of donor AKI on renal function and chronic changes on protocol biopsies at 1-year post-transplant. Donor AKI was defined according to Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Between 2013 and 2017, 333 kidneys were transplanted and subsequently biopsied after 1 year. Fifty-three kidneys from AKI donors (AKIN stage I n = 42, stage II n = 8, stage III n = 3) were compared to 280 kidneys from non-AKI donors. At 1-year follow-up, patient and graft survival were comparable. Donor AKI was not predictive of IFTA (Banff interstitial fibrosis plus tubular atrophy scores) at 1-year post-transplant biopsy (2.10 ± 1.28 in AKI, 2.09 ± 1.22 in non-AKI, P = .95). Donor AKI was also not associated with progression of IFTA from 3 to 12 months (P = .69), or inferior glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, P = .94). In a multivariate analysis, the odds of IFTA >2 were comparable between AKI and non-AKI groups. In conclusion, the transplantation of kidneys from donors with predominantly stage I AKI results in comparable function and degree of fibrosis on protocol biopsies 1-year post-transplant. Selected grafts from donors with AKI are a valuable tool for expanding the donor pool for kidney transplantation.",

All patients who underwent KT from DBD donors between June 2003 and April 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. The KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) criteria were used to classify donor AKI. The cohort included 376 donors (no AKI group, n = 117 [31.1%]; AKI group n = 259 [68.9%]). Death-censored graft survival was similar according to the presence of AKI, AKI severity, and the AKI trend (p = 0.929, p = 0.077, and p = 0.658, respectively). Patients whose donors had AKI who received using low dose (1.5 mg/kg for three days) rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (r-ATG) as the induction agent had significantly superior death-censored graft survival compared with patients in that group who received basiliximab (p = 0.039).

This study aimed to analyze the selection trends of AKI donors and investigate the impact of AKI on graft failure using the United states cohort data. We analyzed a total 52,757 KTs collected in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipient (SRTR) from 2010 to 2015. The sample included 4,962 (9.4%) cases of KTs with AKI donors (creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dL). Clinical characteristics of AKI and non-AKI donors were analyzed and outcomes of both groups were compared. We also analyzed risk factors for graft failure in AKI donor KTs. Although the incidence of delayed graft function was higher in recipients of AKI donors compared to non-AKI donors, graft and patient survival were not significantly different between the two groups. We found donor hypertension, cold ischemic time, the proportion of African American donors, and high KDPI were risk factors for graft failure in AKI donor KTs. KTs from deceased donor with AKI showed comparable outcomes. Thus, donors with AKI need to be considered more actively to expand donor pool. Caution is still needed when donors have additional risk factors of graft failure.",

Kidneys from ≥65-year-old donors with comorbidities are more susceptible to cold ischemia time (CIT) and DGF and it is unknown whether such elderly kidneys with AKI can also be transplanted with satisfactory outcomes. All KTs from ≥65-year-old donors performed at our center from 1999 to 2019 (n = 233) were retrospectively analyzed and short- as well as long-term outcomes were compared for KTs from donors with (n = 64) and without AKI (n = 169). There were no significant differences regarding the frequency of DGF as well as the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 1 and 3 years post-transplant between the no-AKI and the AKI group (DGF: no-AKI 30.2% vs. AKI 40.6%, P = .17; eGFR at 1-year: 31.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 vs. 35.5 ml/min/1.73 m2 , P = .32; at 3-years: 33.8 ml/min/1.73 m2 vs. 40.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 , P = .18; respectively).

Our previous study identified an NF-KappaB interacting lncRNA (NKILA) which was negatively correlated with breast cancer metastasis and patient prognosis. However, its clinical significance and potential role in Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) remain unclear. Here we show that NKILA is down-regulated in TSCC cancer tissues than that in matched adjacent noncancerous tissues. And low NKILA expression in TSCC is significantly correlated with tumor metastasis and poor patient prognosis. In vitro, overexpression of NKILA decreases TSCC cells migration and invasion. Mechanistic study shows that NKILA inhibits the phosphorylation of IκBα and NF-κB activation as well as the induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Ectopic expression of NKILA in Tscca cells inhibits NF-κB activator TNF-α-promoted cell migration and invasion, while applying NF-κB inhibitor Bay-117082 or JSH-23 in NKILA silenced CAL27 cells reverses cell migration capacity to lower level. In vivo experimental metastasis model also demonstrates NKILA inhibits lung metastasis of NOD/SCID mice with TSCC tumors. These results suggested that NKILA is a vital determinant of TSCC migration and invasion and NF-κB signaling pathway mediates this effect. Given the above mentioned function of NKILA, it could act as a potential predictor for overall survival in patients with TSCC and a potential therapeutic target for TSCC intervention.",

However, the clinical significance and biological roles of NKILA in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remain unknown. In this study, we showed that NKILA was downregulated in ESCC tissues and cancer cells compared with their normal counterparts. Low NKILA expression correlated with large tumor size and advanced TNM stage, and predicted poor overall and disease-free survival of ESCC patients. Further loss- and gain-of-function assays indicated that NKILA inhibited proliferation and migration of ESCC cells in vitro, suppressed tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, NKILA could inhibit phosphorylation of IκBα, suppress p65 nuclear translocation and downregulate the expression of NF-κB target genes in ESCC cells. These results suggest NKILA could suppress malignant development of ESCC via abrogation of the NF-κB signaling and may potentially serve as a prognostic marker for ESCC.",

Baicalein, a principle flavonoid, has shown attractive anti-cancer effects on HCC. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and influencing factors contributing to the anti-cancer effects of baicalein on HCC are still largely unknown. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been revealed to be fascinating therapeutic targets for cancers. The roles of NF-κB Interacting LncRNA (NKILA) are recently explored in several cancers. However, the expressions, clinical significances, roles and action mechanisms of NKILA in the anti-cancer effects of baicalein on HCC are unknown. In this study, we found that NKILA is down-regulated in HCC and reduced expression of NKILA indicts poor survival of HCC patients. Functional assays showed that overexpression of NKILA enhances the roles of baicalein on HCC cell proliferation inhibition, apoptosis induction, and migration inhibition in vitro and tumor growth suppression in vivo. Conversely, knockdown of NKILA suppresses the effects of baicalein. Mechanistically, we found that NKILA inhibits IκBα phosphorylation, NF-κB nuclear translocation, and NF-κB activity. NKILA also enhances the inhibitory effects of baicalein on NF-κB signaling. Furthermore, the effects of NKILA on baicalein-induced NF-κB activity inhibition, cell growth inhibition, apoptosis induction, and migration inhibition are reversed by NF-κB nuclear translocation inhibitor JSH-23. Collectively, our data demonstrated that NKILA enhances the anti-cancer effects of baicalein on HCC in vitro and in vivo via the regulation of NF-κB signaling, and implied that the combination of NKILA and baicalein would be potential therapeutic strategies for HCC.",
        "# Title: lncRNA-NKILA/NF-κB feedback loop modulates laryngeal cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and radioresistance.\n# Abstract: Laryngeal cancer is one of the most common head and neck malignant tumors and is commonly resistant to X-ray-based radiotherapy. NF-κB interacting lncRNA (NKILA) has been reported to serve as a tumor suppressor in several cancers through combining with NF-κB: IκB complex thereby inhibiting NF-κB activation. Herein, we demonstrated a low NKILA expression in laryngeal cancer and its correlation with shorter overall survival in patients with laryngeal cancer. NKILA serves as a tumor suppressor in laryngeal cancer by suppressing laryngeal cancer cell viability and migration, whereas promoting cell apoptosis; NKILA knockdown reverses the cytotoxicity of X-ray radiation on laryngeal cancer cells through combining with NF-κB: IκB complex to inhibit IκB phosphorylation, inhibit p65 nuclear translocation, and finally inhibit NF-κB activation. NF-κB binds to the promoter region of NKILA to activate its transcriptional activity, upregulated NKILA then inhibits IκB phosphorylation and NF-κB activation, thus forming a negative feedback loop to sensitize laryngeal cancer cell to X-ray radiation. In conclusion, NKILA can serve as a promising agent of enhancing the cytotoxicity of X-ray radiation on laryngeal cancer and addressing the radioresistance of laryngeal cancer.",

However, the role of NKILA in rectal cancer is still unknown. The objective of this study is to investigate the clinical value and biological function of NKILA in rectal cancer. The association between NKILA expression and clinical variables including prognosis was estimated in rectal cancer patients. The gain-of-function study of NKILA in rectal cancer cell was conducted to evaluate the effect of NKILA on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and NF-κB signaling pathway. The results suggested NKILA expression was decreased in rectal cancer tissues and cells, and correlated with clinical stage, T classification, N classification and M classification. NKILA low-expression was an independent poor prognostic factor in rectal cancer patients. NKILA-inhibited rectal cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via suppressing NF-κB signaling.

        "# Title: Long non-coding RNA NKILA serves as a biomarker in the early diagnosis and prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer.\n# Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. The prognosis of patients with CRC at an advanced stage is poor. Biomarkers currently used in clinical practice, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen (CA) 19-9, lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity for early diagnosis and prediction, therefore there remains a requirement to improve the prognosis of patients with CRC. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been revealed to serve fundamental roles in various pathophysiological processes, including cancer initiation and progression. The present study investigated the expression and clinical significance of the lncRNA nuclear factor-κB interacting long non-coding RNA (NKILA) in CRC. It was identified that NKILA was downregulated in six CRC cell lines and tissues (n=173). Low NKILA expression was significantly associated with a poor differentiation grade, larger tumor size and advanced Tumor-Node-Metastases stages. Further statistical analyses revealed that low NKILA expression predicted poor overall survival (OS) rate and progression-free survival (PFS) rate. In addition, low NKILA expression was determined as an independent risk factor for poor OS and PFS. Furthermore, NKILA exhibited a relatively high sensitivity and specificity compared with CEA and CA19-9 in the early diagnosis of CRC. The serum level of NKILA was positively correlated with the level in tissues. In addition, a decreased NKILA level in serum was revealed to be partially restored post-operatively. In conclusion, low NKILA expression has been demonstrated to accelerate CRC progression and NKILA may be a potential novel biomarker in early diagnosis and prognosis of patients with CRC.",
        "# Title: NKILA, a prognostic indicator, inhibits tumor metastasis by suppressing NF-κB/Slug mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition in hepatocellular carcinoma.\n# Abstract: The metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the major obstacles hindering its therapeutic efficacy, leading to low surgical resection rate, high mortality and poor prognosis. Accumulating evidence has shown that both long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and NF-κB play vital roles in the regulation of cancer metastasis. However, the clinical significance and biological function of NKILA (NF-κB interacting lncRNA) and its interaction with NF-κB in HCC remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that NKILA was down-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines, and decreased NKILA expression was significantly associated with larger tumor size and positive vascular invasion in HCC patients. NKILA reduction was an independent risk factor of HCC patients' poor prognosis, and the 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of patients with low and high NKILA expression were 15.6% and 60.0%, respectively. Moreover, NKILA inhibits migration and invasion of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, NKILA prevents Slug/epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway via suppressing phosphorylation of IκBα, p65 nuclear translocation and NF-κB activation. In conclusion, these results indicate that NKILA might serve as an effective prognostic biomarker and a promising therapeutic target against HCC metastasis."

Sequence-influenced methylations were described in T2DM-associated genomic regions, but evidence for direct, sequence-independent association with disease risk is missing. Here, we explore disease-contributing DNA methylation through a stepwise study design: first, a pool-based, genome-scale screen among 1169 case and control individuals revealed an excess of differentially methylated sites in genomic regions that were previously associated with T2DM through genetic studies. Next, in-depth analyses were performed at selected top-ranking regions. A CpG site in the first intron of the FTO gene showed small (3.35%) but significant (P = 0.000021) hypomethylation of cases relative to controls. The effect was independent of the sequence polymorphism in the region and persists among individuals carrying the sequence-risk alleles. The odds of belonging to the T2DM group increased by 6.1% for every 1% decrease in methylation (OR = 1.061, 95% CI: 1.032-1.090), the odds ratio for decrease of 1 standard deviation of methylation (adjusted to gender) was 1.5856 (95% CI: 1.2824-1.9606) and the sensitivity (area under the curve = 0.638, 95% CI: 0.586-0.690; males = 0.675, females = 0.609) was better than that of the strongest known sequence variant. Furthermore, a prospective study in an independent population cohort revealed significant hypomethylation of young individuals that later progressed to T2DM, relative to the individuals who stayed healthy. Further genomic analysis revealed co-localization with gene enhancers and with binding sites for methylation-sensitive transcriptional regulators. The data showed that low methylation level at the analyzed sites is an early marker of T2DM and suggests a novel mechanism by which early-onset, inter-individual methylation variation at isolated non-promoter genomic sites predisposes to T2DM.",
        "# Title: DNA methylation profiling identifies epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetic patients.\n# Abstract: In addition to genetic predisposition, environmental and lifestyle factors contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Epigenetic changes may provide the link for translating environmental exposures into pathological mechanisms. In this study, we performed the first comprehensive DNA methylation profiling in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We uncovered 276 CpG loci affiliated to promoters of 254 genes displaying significant differential DNA methylation in diabetic islets. These methylation changes were not present in blood cells from T2D individuals nor were they experimentally induced in non-diabetic islets by exposure to high glucose. For a subgroup of the differentially methylated genes, concordant transcriptional changes were present. Functional annotation of the aberrantly methylated genes and RNAi experiments highlighted pathways implicated in β-cell survival and function; some are implicated in cellular dysfunction while others facilitate adaptation to stressors. Together, our findings offer new insights into the intricate mechanisms of T2D pathogenesis, underscore the important involvement of epigenetic dysregulation in diabetic islets and may advance our understanding of T2D aetiology.",

Epigenetics may affect disease susceptibility. To describe the human methylome in pancreatic islets and determine the epigenetic basis of T2D, we analyzed DNA methylation of 479,927 CpG sites and the transcriptome in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We provide a detailed map of the global DNA methylation pattern in human islets, β- and α-cells. Genomic regions close to the transcription start site showed low degrees of methylation and regions further away from the transcription start site such as the gene body, 3'UTR and intergenic regions showed a higher degree of methylation. While CpG islands were hypomethylated, the surrounding 2 kb shores showed an intermediate degree of methylation, whereas regions further away (shelves and open sea) were hypermethylated in human islets, β- and α-cells. We identified 1,649 CpG sites and 853 genes, including TCF7L2, FTO and KCNQ1, with differential DNA methylation in T2D islets after correction for multiple testing. The majority of the differentially methylated CpG sites had an intermediate degree of methylation and were underrepresented in CpG islands (∼ 7%) and overrepresented in the open sea (∼ 60%). 102 of the differentially methylated genes, including CDKN1A, PDE7B, SEPT9 and EXOC3L2, were differentially expressed in T2D islets. Methylation of CDKN1A and PDE7B promoters in vitro suppressed their transcriptional activity. Functional analyses demonstrated that identified candidate genes affect pancreatic β- and α-cells as Exoc3l silencing reduced exocytosis and overexpression of Cdkn1a, Pde7b and Sept9 perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion in clonal β- and α-cells, respectively. Together, our data can serve as a reference methylome in human islets. We provide new target genes with altered DNA methylation and expression in human T2D islets that contribute to perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion. These results highlight the importance of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of T2D.",
        "# Title: Altered DNA methylation and differential expression of genes influencing metabolism and inflammation in adipose tissue from subjects with type 2 diabetes.\n# Abstract: Genetics, epigenetics, and environment may together affect the susceptibility for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our aim was to dissect molecular mechanisms underlying T2D using genome-wide expression and DNA methylation data in adipose tissue from monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D and independent case-control cohorts. In adipose tissue from diabetic twins, we found decreased expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation; carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism; and increased expression of genes involved in inflammation and glycan degradation. The most differentially expressed genes included ELOVL6, GYS2, FADS1, SPP1 (OPN), CCL18, and IL1RN. We replicated these results in adipose tissue from an independent case-control cohort. Several candidate genes for obesity and T2D (e.g., IRS1 and VEGFA) were differentially expressed in discordant twins. We found a heritable contribution to the genome-wide DNA methylation variability in twins. Differences in methylation between monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D were subsequently modest. However, 15,627 sites, representing 7,046 genes including PPARG, KCNQ1, TCF7L2, and IRS1, showed differential DNA methylation in adipose tissue from unrelated subjects with T2D compared with control subjects. A total of 1,410 of these sites also showed differential DNA methylation in the twins discordant for T2D. For the differentially methylated sites, the heritability estimate was 0.28. We also identified copy number variants (CNVs) in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D. Taken together, subjects with T2D exhibit multiple transcriptional and epigenetic changes in adipose tissue relevant to the development of the disease.",
        "# Title: An integrated epigenomic analysis for type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci in monozygotic twins.\n# Abstract: DNA methylation has a great potential for understanding the aetiology of common complex traits such as Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here we perform genome-wide methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) in whole-blood-derived DNA from 27 monozygotic twin pairs and follow up results with replication and integrated omics analyses. We identify predominately hypermethylated T2D-related differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and replicate the top signals in 42 unrelated T2D cases and 221 controls. The strongest signal is in the promoter of the MALT1 gene, involved in insulin and glycaemic pathways, and related to taurocholate levels in blood. Integrating the DNA methylome findings with T2D GWAS meta-analysis results reveals a strong enrichment for DMRs in T2D-susceptibility loci. We also detect signals specific to T2D-discordant twins in the GPR61 and PRKCB genes. These replicated T2D associations reflect both likely causal and consequential pathways of the disease. The analysis indicates how an integrated genomics and epigenomics approach, utilizing an MZ twin design, can provide pathogenic insights as well as potential drug targets and biomarkers for T2D and other complex traits.",

In the setting of large, extended families representing a minority, high-risk population of the USA, we aimed to characterize the role of epigenome-wide DNA methylation in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Using Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays, we tested for association of DNA methylation at 446 356 sites with age, sex and phenotypic traits related to T2D in 850 pedigreed Mexican-American individuals. Robust statistical analyses showed that (i) 15% of the methylome is significantly heritable, with a median heritability of 0.14; (ii) DNA methylation at 14% of CpG sites is associated with nearby sequence variants; (iii) 22% and 3% of the autosomal CpG sites are associated with age and sex, respectively; (iv) 53 CpG sites were significantly associated with liability to T2D, fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance; (v) DNA methylation levels at five CpG sites, mapping to three well-characterized genes (TXNIP, ABCG1 and SAMD12) independently explained 7.8% of the heritability of T2D (vi) methylation at these five sites was unlikely to be influenced by neighboring DNA sequence variation. Our study has identified novel epigenetic indicators of T2D risk in Mexican Americans who have increased risk for this disease. These results provide new insights into potential treatment targets of T2D.",

        "# Title: Epigenome-wide association study identifies TXNIP gene associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and sustained hyperglycemia.\n# Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is an established risk factor for a wide range of vascular diseases, including ischemic stroke (IS). Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a marker for average blood glucose levels over the previous 12 weeks, is used as a measure of glycemic control and also as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes (HbA1c levels ≥ 6.5%). Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, may be associated with aging processes and with modulation of the risk of various pathologies, such as DM. Specifically, DNA methylation could be one of the mechanisms mediating the relation between DM and environmental exposures. Our goal was to identify new CpG methylation sites associated with DM. We performed a genome-wide methylation study in whole-blood DNA from an IS patient cohorts. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array was used to measure DNA methylation in CpG sites. All statistical analyses were adjusted for sex, age, hyperlipidemia, body mass index (BMI), smoking habit and cell count. Findings were replicated in two independent cohorts, an IS cohort and a population-based cohort, using the same array. In the discovery phase (N = 355), we identified a CpG site, cg19693031 (located in the TXNIP gene) that was associated with DM (P = 1.17 × 10(-12)); this CpG was replicated in two independent cohorts (N = 167 and N = 645). Methylation of TXNIP was inversely and intensely associated with HbA1c levels (P = 7.3 × 10(-16)), specifically related to diabetic patients with poor control of glucose levels. We identified an association between the TXNIP gene and DM through epigenetic mechanisms, related to sustained hyperglycemia levels (HbA1c ≥ 7%).",

Here we examine whether age-related epigenetic changes affect human islet function and if blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect these changes and associate with future T2D. We analyse DNA methylation genome-wide in islets from 87 non-diabetic donors, aged 26-74 years. Aging associates with increased DNA methylation of 241 sites. These sites cover loci previously associated with T2D, for example, KLF14. Blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related methylation changes in 83 genes identified in human islets (for example, KLF14, FHL2, ZNF518B and FAM123C) and some associate with insulin secretion and T2D. DNA methylation correlates with islet expression of multiple genes, including FHL2, ZNF518B, GNPNAT1 and HLTF. Silencing these genes in β-cells alter insulin secretion. Together, we demonstrate that blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related DNA methylation changes in human islets, and associate with insulin secretion in vivo and T2D.",

To conduct a genome-wide DNA methylation in individuals with type 2 diabetes, individuals with prediabetes, and control mixed ancestry individuals from South Africa. Methods. We used peripheral blood to perform genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in 3 individuals with screen detected diabetes, 3 individuals with prediabetes, and 3 individuals with normoglycaemia from the Bellville South Community, Cape Town, South Africa, who were age-, gender-, body mass index-, and duration of residency-matched. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) was performed by Arraystar Inc. (Rockville, MD, USA). Results. Hypermethylated DMRs were 1160 (81.97%) and 124 (43.20%), respectively, in individuals with diabetes and prediabetes when both were compared to subjects with normoglycaemia. Our data shows that genes related to the immune system, signal transduction, glucose transport, and pancreas development have altered DNA methylation in subjects with prediabetes and diabetes. Pathway analysis based on the functional analysis mapping of genes to KEGG pathways suggested that the linoleic acid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism pathways are hypomethylated in prediabetes and diabetes. Conclusions. Our study suggests that epigenetic changes are likely to be an early process that occurs before the onset of overt diabetes. Detailed analysis of DMRs that shows gradual methylation differences from control versus prediabetes to prediabetes versus diabetes in a larger sample size is required to confirm these findings.",

Only a few studies have investigated DNA methylation of selected candidate genes or a very small fraction of genomic CpG sites in human pancreatic islets, the tissue of primary pathogenic importance for diabetes. Our aim was to characterize the whole-genome DNA methylation landscape in human pancreatic islets, to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in diabetic islets, and to investigate the function of DMRs in islet biology. Here, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, which is a comprehensive and unbiased method to study DNA methylation throughout the genome at a single nucleotide resolution, in pancreatic islets from donors with T2D and control subjects without diabetes. We identified 25,820 DMRs in islets from individuals with T2D. These DMRs cover loci with known islet function, e.g., PDX1, TCF7L2, and ADCY5 Importantly, binding sites previously identified by ChIP-seq for islet-specific transcription factors, enhancer regions, and different histone marks were enriched in the T2D-associated DMRs. We also identified 457 genes, including NR4A3, PARK2, PID1, SLC2A2, and SOCS2, that had both DMRs and significant expression changes in T2D islets. To mimic the situation in T2D islets, candidate genes were overexpressed or silenced in cultured β-cells. This resulted in impaired insulin secretion, thereby connecting differential methylation to islet dysfunction. We further explored the islet methylome and found a strong link between methylation levels and histone marks. Additionally, DNA methylation in different genomic regions and of different transcript types (i.e., protein coding, noncoding, and pseudogenes) was associated with islet expression levels. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the islet DNA methylome in individuals with and without diabetes and highlights the importance of epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets and T2D pathogenesis."

Specifically, altered methylation at numerous CpG sites, particularly within genes involved in insulin secretion, glucose metabolism, inflammation, and β-cell function (including *FTO*, *TCF7L2*, *TXNIP*, *CDKN1A*, *PPARG*, *MALT1*, *IRS1*, *PDX1*, *ADCY5*), contributes to T2D pathogenesis, with hypomethylation in the *FTO* gene promoter in blood being a significant predictor of T2D risk, and islet-specific changes potentially representing early pathogenic events.",
        "conclusionB": "Across multiple tissues and populations, altered DNA methylation is consistently associated with type 2 diabetes, with replicated findings demonstrating that differential methylation – particularly at sites near genes involved in glucose metabolism, insulin secretion, and inflammation (including *TXNIP*, *FTO*, *TCF7L2*, and *PPARG*) – contributes to disease pathogenesis and, in some cases, precedes disease onset; however, the magnitude of methylation changes is often modest and further research is needed to fully elucidate the functional implications of these epigenetic alterations."

Four hundred twenty-nine patients had migraine, of which 16.5% reported that headaches could be precipitated by cheese or chocolate, and nearly always both. Of the migraine patients, 18.4% reported sensitivity to all alcoholic drinks, while another 11.8% were sensitive to red wine but not to white wine; 28% of the migrainous patients reported that beer would precipitate headaches. There was a definite statistical association between sensitivity to cheese/chocolate and to red wine (P < 0.001) and also to beer (P < 0.001), but none between diet sensitivity and sensitivity to alcoholic drinks in general. None of 40 patients with tension headache (diagnosed by International Headache Society criteria) reported sensitivity to foods, and only one was sensitive to alcoholic drinks. The prevalence of sensitivity among 46 patients with some migrainous features was intermediate between the migraine and tension headache categories. It is concluded that cheese/chocolate and red wine sensitivity, in particular, have closely related mechanisms, in some way related more to migraine than to more chronic tension-type headache, while quite separate mechanisms play a major role in sensitivity to alcoholic drinks in general.",

The Head-HUNT Study.\n# Abstract: The aim of this study was to examine a possible association between smoking, alcohol and headache in a large population-based cross-sectional study. A total of 51,383 subjects completed a headache questionnaire and constituted the 'Head-HUNT' Study. Questionnaire-based information on smoking was available in 95% and on alcohol in 89% of the individuals. Associations were assessed in multivariate analyses, estimating prevalence odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Prevalence rates for headache were higher amongst smokers compared with never smokers, most evident for those under 40 years smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.6). Passive smoking was also associated with higher headache prevalence. For alcohol use, there was a tendency of decreasing prevalence of migraine with increasing amounts of alcohol consumption compared with alcohol abstinence. Only with regard to symptoms indicating alcohol overuse, a positive association with frequent headache was found. The association between headache and smoking found in the present study raises questions about a causal relationship, e.g. that smoking causes headache or that it allays stress induced by headache. The observed negative association between migraine and alcohol consumption is probably explained by the headache precipitating properties of alcohol.",

        "# Title: Prospective and randomized evaluation of ACL reconstruction with three techniques: a clinical and radiographic evaluation at 5 years follow-up.\n# Abstract: A variety of graft sources have been used for ACL reconstruction to improve functions and kinematics in ACL deficient knees. The two most commonly used autogenous grafts are the central third of the patellar tendon and the hamstring tendon constructs. The choice of different grafts and different construct influence the final clinical outcome of ACL reconstruction. The 3 groups, of 25 patients each, were generated by choosing the technique (PT tendon, 4 strand hamstring, and single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty) to utilize and followed for 5 years, with an alternate systematic sampling. Our comparison has shown significant kneeling pain in the patellar tendon with respect to the groups with hamstrings techniques. Single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty achieved subjective score significantly higher with respect to the other two groups as well as for the time to resume sport. The study confirms that patellar tendon and hamstring can be equivalent options for ACL reconstruction. This study demonstrated that a superior outcome as far as subjective clinical findings were concerned, was obtained in group III. Patients in the latter group were also able to return to sports sooner than those in the bone-patellar tendon graft group and the four-strand hamstring group.",

The purpose of this prospective randomized study was to compare the clinical, instrumental and X-ray outcome of two ACL reconstruction techniques with hamstring tendons: one with a single intra-articular bundle associated to an extra-articular sling, the second with a more anatomic double-bundle technique that reproduces better the native ACL function. From an initial group of 100 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction, 72 patients (35 single bundle plus lateral plasty and 37 double bundle) were evaluated with IKDC, Tegner score, KT2000 arthrometer, Activity Rating Scale, Psychovitality Questionnaire and Ahlback radiographic score at a mean 3 years follow-up. Double-bundle group showed significantly better results regarding IKDC, ROM, Activity Rating Scale and time to return to sport. Also KT 2000 showed significant differences in objective stability.

Here, we present data from a retrospective analysis using PET/CT and PET/MRI examinations to investigate the efficacy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET for primary N-staging of patients with prostate cancer (PC) compared with morphologic imaging (CT or MRI) and validated by histopathology. Methods: Data from 58 patients with high-risk PC (according to the D'Amico criteria) who were staged with 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET/CT or PET/MRI at our institution between July 2017 and June 2018 were reviewed. The patients had a median prescan prostate-specific antigen value of 12.2 ng/mL (range, 1.2-81.6 ng/mL). The median injected activity of 18F-rhPSMA-7 was 327 MBq (range, 132-410 MBq), with a median uptake time of 79.5 min (range, 60-153 min). All patients underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection. The presence of lymph node metastases was determined by an experienced reader independently for both the PET and the morphologic datasets using a template-based analysis on a 5-point scale. Patient-level and template-based results were both compared with histopathologic findings. Results: Lymph node metastases were present in 18 patients (31.0%) and were located in 52 of 375 templates (13.9%). Receiver-operating-characteristic analyses showed 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET to perform significantly better than morphologic imaging on both patient-based and template-based analyses (areas under curve, 0.858 vs. 0.649 [P = 0.012] and 0.765 vs. 0.589 [P < 0.001], respectively). On patient-based analyses, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET were 72.2%, 92.5%, and 86.2%, respectively, and those of morphologic imaging were 50.0%, 72.5%, and 65.5%, respectively. On template-based analyses, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET were 53.8%, 96.9%, and 90.9%, respectively, and those of morphologic imaging were 9.6%, 95.0%, and 83.2%, respectively.

Our approach in vaccine development uses recombinant expression of the highly immunogenic HAV antigen VP1-P2a in food-grade lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis and in Escherichia coli. We used genetic constructs that enable nisin-controlled expression of the antigen in L. lactis in three different forms: (a) intracellularly, (b) on the bacterial surface and (c) on the bacterial surface fused with the fragment of the E. coli flagellin molecule that can act as a molecular adjuvant. Expression of the two surface forms of the antigen was achieved in L. lactis, and the resulting antigen-displaying bacteria were administered orally to mice. Half the animals in each of the two groups developed specific IgGs, with titers increasing over time and reaching 1:422 without flagellin and 1:320 with flagellin. A much higher titer 1:25,803 was observed with the parenterally administered antigen, which was purified from E. coli. With the latter, a significant mucosal IgA response was also observed. Despite significant titers, the IgGs elicited with oral or parenteral administration could not prevent HAV from infecting cells in a virus neutralization assay, suggesting that the antibodies cannot recognize viral surface epitopes. Nevertheless, orally administered HAV antigen expressed in L. lactis elicited significant systemic humoral immune response showing the feasibility for development of effective HAV vaccine for mucosal delivery.",
        "# Title: Oral immunization with recombinant Lactococcus lactis delivering a multi-epitope antigen CTB-UE attenuates Helicobacter pylori infection in mice.\n# Abstract: Urease is an essential virulence factor and colonization factor for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and is considered as an excellent vaccine candidate antigen. However, conventional technologies for preparing an injectable vaccine require purification of the antigenic protein and preparation of an adjuvant. Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 (L. lactis) could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of edible vaccine. In previous study, we constructed a multi-epitope vaccine, designated CTB-UE, which is composed of the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), three Th cell epitopes and two B-cell epitopes from urease subunits. To develop a novel type of oral vaccine against H. pylori, genetically modified L. lactis strains were established to secrete this epitope vaccine extracellularly in this study. Oral prophylactic immunization with recombinant L. lactis significantly elicited humoral anti-urease antibody responses (P < 0.001) and reduced the gastric colonization of H. pylori from 7.14 ± 0.95 to 4.68 ± 0.98 log10 CFU g(-1) stomach. This L. lactis oral vaccine offers a promising vaccine candidate for the control of H. pylori infection.",
        "# Title: Development of a new DNA vaccine based on mycobacterial ESAT-6 antigen delivered by recombinant invasive Lactococcus lactis FnBPA+.\n# Abstract: The use of the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis as a vehicle for the oral delivery of DNA vaccine plasmids constitutes a promising strategy for vaccination. The delivery of DNA plasmids into eukaryotic cells is of critical importance for subsequent DNA expression and effectiveness of the vaccine. In this context, the use of the recombinant invasive L. lactis FnBPA+ (fibronectin-binding protein A) strain for the oral delivery of the eukaryotic expression vector vaccination using lactic acid bacteria (pValac), coding for the 6-kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6) gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, could represent a new DNA vaccine strategy against tuberculosis. To this end, the ESAT-6 sequence was cloned into the pValac vector; the L. lactis fibronectin-binding protein A (FnBPA)+ (pValac:ESAT-6) strain was obtained, and its immunological profile was checked in BALB/c mice. This strain was able to significantly increase interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production in spleen cells, showing a systemic T helper 1 (Th1) cell response. The mice also showed a significant increase in specific secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) production in colon tissue and fecal extracts. Thus, this is the first time that L. lactis has been used to deliver a plasmid DNA harboring a gene that encodes an antigen against tuberculosis through mucous membranes.",
        "# Title: Lactococcus lactis displayed neuraminidase confers cross protective immunity against influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Influenza A viruses pose a serious threat to public health. Current influenza A vaccines predominantly focus on hemagglutinin (HA) and show strain-specific protection. Neuraminidase (NA) is much less studied in the context of humoral immunity against influenza A viruses. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cross protective immunity of NA presented on Lactococcus lactis (L.lactis) surface against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in the mouse model. L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA was constructed in which pgsA was used as an anchor protein. Mice vaccinated orally with L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA could elicit significant NA-specific serum IgG and mucosa IgA antibodies, as well as neuraminidase inhibition (NI) titers. Importantly, L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA provided 80% protection against H5N1, 60% protection against H3N2 and H1N1, respectively. These findings suggest that recombinant L.lactis/pNZ110-pgsA-NA in the absence of adjuvant via oral administration can be served as an effective vaccine candidate against diverse strains of influenza A viruses.",
        "# Title: Broadly protective immunity against divergent influenza viruses by oral co-administration of Lactococcus lactis expressing nucleoprotein adjuvanted with cholera toxin B subunit in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines need to be annually reformulated to well match the predicated circulating strains. Thus, it is critical for developing a novel universal influenza vaccine that would be able to confer cross-protection against constantly emerging divergent influenza virus strains. Influenza virus A is a genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses. Influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) is a structural protein which encapsidates the negative strand viral RNA, and anti-NP antibodies play role in cross-protective immunity. Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) is an ideal vaccine delivery vehicle via oral administration route. However, L. lactis vectored vaccine exhibits poor immunogenicity without the use of mucosal adjuvant. To enhance the immunogenicity of L. lactis vectored vaccine, cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit, one of mucosal adjuvants, is a safe adjuvant for oral route, when combined with L. lactis vectored vaccine. In this study, we hypothesized that pNZ8008, a L. lactis expression plasmid, encoding NP antigen, would be able to elicit cross-protection with the use of CTB via oral administration route.",
        "# Title: Cross-protection of Lactococcus lactis-displayed HA2 subunit against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines provide strain-specific protection against homologous subtypes and need to be updated annually. Therefore, it is essential to develop a universal vaccine that would induce broadly cross-protective immunity against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses. The highly conserved HA2 subunit is a promising candidate for developing a universal influenza vaccine. Here, we hypothesized that the HA2 subunit could be displayed on the surface of Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis), using Spax as an anchor protein (L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2) and that L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 would have immunogenicity by oral administration without the use of adjuvant in the mouse model. To address this hypothesis, we show that oral vaccination of mice with L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 elicited significant humoral and mucosal immune responses. Importantly, L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 provided 100% protection against homologous H5N1 or heterologous H1N1 virus challenge. These results suggest that an HA2 subunit presented on the surface of L. lactis is an effective universal vaccine candidate against influenza A viruses in the poultry industry and in humans.",
        "# Title: Oral Immunization with a Recombinant Lactococcus lactis-Expressing HIV-1 Antigen on Group A Streptococcus Pilus Induces Strong Mucosal Immunity in the Gut.\n# Abstract: The induction of a potent humoral and cellular immune response in mucosal tissue is important for the development of an effective HIV vaccine. Most of the current HIV vaccines under development use the i.m. route for immunization, which is relatively poor in generating potent and long-lived mucosal immune responses. In this article, we explore the ability of an oral vaccination with a probiotic organism, Lactococcus lactis, to elicit HIV-specific immune responses in the mucosal and systemic compartments of BALB/c mice. We expressed the HIV-1 Gag-p24 on the tip of the T3 pilus of Streptococcus pyogenes as a fusion to the Cpa protein (LL-Gag). After four monthly LL-Gag oral immunizations, we observed strong Gag-specific IgG and IgA responses in serum, feces, and vaginal secretions. However, the Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses in the blood were at or below our detection limit. After an i.m. modified vaccinia Ankara/Gag boost, we observed robust Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses both in systemic and in mucosal tissues, including intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes of the small intestine, Peyer's patches, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Consistent with strong immunogenicity, the LL-Gag induced activation of CD11c(+) CD11b(+) dendritic cells in the Peyer's patches after oral immunization. Our results demonstrate that oral immunization with L. lactis expressing an Ag on the tip of the group A Streptococcus pilus serves as an excellent vaccine platform to induce strong mucosal humoral and cellular immunity against HIV.",

        "# Title: Production and delivery of Helicobacter pylori NapA in Lactococcus lactis and its protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity.\n# Abstract: Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein A subunit (NapA) has been identified as a virulence factor, a protective antigen and a potent immunomodulator. NapA shows unique application potentials for anti-H. pylori vaccines and treatment strategies of certain allergic diseases and carcinomas. However, appropriate production and utilization modes of NapA still remain uncertain to date. This work has established a novel efficient production and utilization mode of NapA by using L. lactis as an expression host and delivery vector, and demonstrated immune protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity of the engineered L. lactis by oral vaccination of mice. It was observed for the first time that H. pylori NapA promotes both polarized Th17 and Th1 responses, which may greatly affect the clinical application of NapA. This report offers a promising anti-H. pylori oral vaccine candidate and a potent mucosal immune modulatory agent. Meanwhile, it uncovers a way to produce and deliver the oral vaccine and immunomodulator by fermentation of food like milk, which might have striking effects on control of H. pylori infection, gastrointestinal cancers, and Th2 bias allergic diseases, including many food allergies.",
        "# Title: Protective immunity induced by an intranasal multivalent vaccine comprising 10 Lactococcus lactis strains expressing highly prevalent M-protein antigens derived from Group A Streptococcus.\n# Abstract: Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) causes diseases ranging from mild pharyngitis to severe invasive infections. The N-terminal fragment of streptococcal M protein elicits protective antibodies and is an attractive vaccine target. However, this N- terminal fragment is hypervariable: there are more than 200 different M types. In this study, an intranasal live bacterial vaccine comprising 10 strains of Lactococcus lactis, each expressing one N-terminal fragment of M protein, has been developed. Live bacterial-vectored vaccines cost less to manufacture because the processes involved are less complex than those required for production of protein subunit vaccines. Moreover, intranasal administration does not require syringes or specialized personnel. Evaluation of individual vaccine types (M1, M2, M3, M4, M6, M9, M12, M22, M28 and M77) showed that most of them protected mice against challenge with virulent S. pyogenes. All 10 strains combined in a 10-valent vaccine (M×10) induced serum and bronchoalveolar lavage IgG titers that ranged from three- to 10-fold those of unimmunized mice. After intranasal challenge with M28 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice was significantly higher than that of unimmunized mice. In contrast, when mice were challenged with M75 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice did not differ significantly from that of unimmunized mice. Mx-10 immunized mice had significantly less S. pyogenes in oropharyngeal washes and developed less severe disease symptoms after challenge than did unimmunized mice. Our L. lactis-based vaccine may provide an alternative solution to development of broadly protective group A streptococcal vaccines.",
        "# Title: Mucosal and systemic immune responses elicited by recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a fusion protein composed of pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin from Bordetella pertussis.\n# Abstract: We constructed a food-grade expression system harboring a F1S1 fusion protein of Bordetella pertussis to be produced in Lactococcus lactis NZ3900 as a new oral vaccine model against whooping cough, caused by B. pertussis. F1S1 was composed of N-terminally truncated S1 subunit of pertussis toxin and type I immunodominant domain of filamentous hemagglutinin which are both known as protective immunogens against pertussis. The recombinant L. lactis was administered via oral or intranasal routes to BALB/c mice and the related specific systemic and mucosal immune responses were then evaluated. The results indicated significantly higher levels of specific IgA in the lung extracts and IgG in sera of mucosally-immunized mice, compared to their controls. It was revealed that higher levels of IgG2a, compared to IgG1, were produced in all mucosally-immunized mice. Moreover, immunized mice developed Th1 responses with high levels of IFN-γ production by the spleen cells. These findings provide evidence for L. lactis to be used as a suitable vehicle for expression and delivery of F1S1 fusion protein to mucosa and induction of appropriate systemic and mucosal immune responses against pertussis.",
        "# Title: Rotavirus VP6 protein mucosally delivered by cell wall-derived particles from Lactococcus lactis induces protection against infection in a murine model.\n# Abstract: Rotaviruses are the primary cause of acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide. Although the implementation of live attenuated vaccines has reduced the number of rotavirus-associated deaths, variance in their effectiveness has been reported in different countries. This fact, among other concerns, leads to continuous efforts for the development of new generation of vaccines against rotavirus.In this work, we describe the obtention of cell wall-derived particles from a recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a cell wall-anchored version of the rotavirus VP6 protein. After confirming by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, flow cytometry and electronic immunomicroscopy that these particles were carrying the VP6 protein, their immunogenic potential was evaluated in adult BALB/c mice. For that, mucosal immunizations (oral or intranasal), with or without the dmLT [(double mutant Escherichia coli heat labile toxin LT(R192G/L211A)] adjuvant were performed. The results showed that these cell wall-derived particles were able to generate anti-rotavirus IgG and IgA antibodies only when administered intranasally, whether the adjuvant was present or not. However, the presence of dmLT was necessary to confer protection against rotavirus infection, which was evidenced by a 79.5 percent viral shedding reduction.In summary, this work describes the production of cell wall-derived particles which were able to induce a protective immune response after intranasal immunization. Further studies are needed to characterize the immune response elicited by these particles as well as to determine their potential as an alternative to the use of live L. lactis for mucosal antigen delivery.",

        "# Title: A Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB)-Based Vaccine Candidate for Human Norovirus.\n# Abstract: Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are responsible for more than 95% of the non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis epidemics in the world. The CDC estimates that every year 21 million individuals suffer from HuNoV-induced gastroenteritis in the United States. Currently, there is no FDA-approved vaccine for HuNoVs. Development of an effective vaccine has been hampered by the lack of an efficient cell culture system for HuNoVs and a suitable small animal model for pathogenesis study. In this study, we developed lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as a vector to deliver HuNoV antigen. A LAB strain (Lactococcus lactis) carrying VP1 gene of a HuNoV GII.4 virus (LAB-VP1) was constructed. It was found that HuNoV VP1 protein was highly expressed by LAB vector and was secreted into media supernatants. To test whether LAB-based HuNoV vaccine candidate is immunogenic, 4-day-old gnotobiotic piglets were orally inoculated with various doses of LAB-VP1. It was found that LABs were persistent in the small intestine of piglets and shed in pig feces for at least 25 days post inoculation. LAB DNA and VP1 were detected in mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen tissue in LAB-VP1 inoculated groups. HuNoV-specific IgG and IgA were detectable in serum and feces respectively at day 13 post-inoculation, and further increased at later time points. After being challenged with HuNoV GII.4 strain, a large amount of HuNoV antigens were observed in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum sections of the intestine in the LAB control group. In contrast, significantly less, or no, HuNoV antigens were detected in the LAB-VP1 immunized groups. Collectively, these results demonstrate that a LAB-based HuNoV vaccine induces protective immunity in gnotobiotic piglets.",

        "# Title: Mucosal Vaccination with Lactococcus lactis-Secreting Surface Immunological Protein Induces Humoral and Cellular Immune Protection against Group B Streptococcus in a Murine Model.\n# Abstract: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the primary etiological agent of sepsis and meningitis in newborns and is associated with premature birth and stillbirth. The development of a licensed vaccine is one of the pending challenges for the World Health Organization. Previously, we showed that oral immunization with surface immune protein (SIP) decreases vaginal colonization of GBS and generates functional opsonizing antibodies, which was determined by opsonophagocytic assays (OPA) in vitro. We also showed that the protein has an adjuvant vaccine profile. Therefore, an oral vaccine based on SIP may be an attractive alternative to employ in the development of new vaccines against GBS. Lactococcus lactis is a highlighted oral vaccine probiotic inducer of the mucosal immune response. This bacterium could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of an edible vaccine and has been used in clinical trials. In this study, we showed that an oral vaccine with a recombinant L. lactis strain secreting SIP from GBS (rL. lactis-SIP) can induce protective humoral and cellular immunity in an experimental model of GBS vaginal colonization in C57BL/6 mice. Mice immunized with rL. lactis-SIP were protected against clinical symptoms and bacterial colonization after GBS vaginal colonization. Our rL. lactis-SIP vaccine also induces an increase of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) specifically against SIP. The adoptive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice to naïve mice generated protection against GBS vaginal colonization. Moreover, the rL. lactis-SIP strain induces the activation of SIP-specific T cells, which could decrease GBS vaginal colonization and generate protective antibodies when transferred to other mice. Our experimental observations strongly support the notion that rL. lactis-SIP induces protective humoral and cellular immunity and could be considered as a novel alternative in the development of vaccines for GBS.",
        "# Title: Recombinant Lactococcus Lactis Displaying Omp31 Antigen of Brucella melitensis Can Induce an Immunogenic Response in BALB/c Mice.\n# Abstract: Since Brucella infection mostly occurs through the mucosal surfaces, immune response induced by vaccine that is delivered by a way of mucosal route can be drastically enhanced to control the brucellosis. Omp31is the major outer membrane protein of Brucella, and is considered as a protective antigen against Brucella infection. Accordingly, Lactococcus lactis has been used as an antigen-delivering vector to develop a vaccine-induced mucosal response for having a safer vaccination against brucellosis. A designed omp31 gene fused to the usp45 signal peptide and M6 cell wall anchor was sub cloned in the pNZ7021 expression vector, and a recombinant L. lactis displaying Omp31 was constructed. Omp31 protein expression was confirmed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. Animals were orally and intraperitoneally immunized with live or killed L. lactis expressing Omp31, respectively. The humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated by measuring the specific cytokines and antibodies. sIgA, serum IgA, IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in the mice immunized with live recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31 and also serum IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in mice immunized with killed recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31. Among IgG subtypes, IgG2a response was significantly higher in both groups compared to IgG1. In mice groups immunized with recombinant L. lactis, the IFN-γ and IL-10 level elevated; however, there was no change in the level of IL-4. These results indicated that recombinants L. lactis induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, and also vaccines based on L. lactis-derived live carriers are promising interventions against Brucella melitensis infections.",
        "# Title: Lactococcus lactis FNBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) Induces Cellular and Humoral Immune Responses After Oral Immunization of Mice.\n# Abstract: The development of a new vaccine strategy against tuberculosis is urgently needed and has been greatly encouraged by the scientific community worldwide. In this work, we constructed a lactococcal DNA vaccine based on the fusion of two Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens, ESAT-6 and Ag85A, and examined its immunogenicity. The coding sequences of the ESAT-6 and Ag85A genes were fused and cloned into the eukaryotic expression pValac vector, and the functionality of the vector was confirmed in vitro. Then, L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) was obtained and used for oral immunization of mice. This strain induced significant increases in IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-17 cytokines in stimulated splenocyte cultures, and significant production of antigen-specific sIgA was observed in the colonic tissues of immunized mice. We demonstrated that L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) generated a cellular and humoral immune response after oral immunization of mice. The strategy developed in this work may represent an interesting DNA mucosal vaccine candidate against tuberculosis, using the fusion of two highly immunogenic antigens delivered by safe lactic acid bacteria.",
        "# Title: Protective Immunity Against Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli by Oral Vaccination of Engineered Lactococcus lactis.\n# Abstract: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the leading causes of diarrhea in children globally, and thus suitable vaccines are desired. Antigen display on lactic acid bacteria is a reliable approach for efficient oral vaccination and preventing bowel diseases. To develop an oral vaccine against ETEC, the gene of the binding domain from heat-labile toxin (LTB), a key ETEC virulence factor, was codon-optimized and cloned into a construct containing a signal peptide and an anchor for display on L. lactis. Bioinformatics analysis showed a codon adaptation index of 0.95 for the codon-optimized gene. Cell surface expression of LTB was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and blotting. White New Zealand rabbits were immunized per os (PO) with the recombinant L. lactis, and the antibody titers were assayed with ELISA. In vitro neutralization assay was performed using mouse adrenal tumor cells and rabbit ileal loop test was performed as the in vivo assay. ELISA results indicated that oral administration of the engineered L. lactis elicited a significant production of IgA in the intestine. In vitro neutralization assay showed that the effect of the toxin could be neutralized with 500 µg/ml of IgG isolated from the oral vaccine group. Furthermore, the dose of ETEC causing fluid accumulation in the ileal loop test showed a tenfold increase in rabbits immunized with either recombinant L. lactis or LTB protein compared to other groups. Our results imply that recombinant L. lactis could potentially be an effective live oral vaccine against ETEC toxicity.",
        "# Title: Oral Immunization of Mice with Cell Extracts from Recombinant Lactococcus lactis Expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein.\n# Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all over the world and became a pandemic that named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). At present, several intramuscular vaccines have been successfully developed and mass vaccination has progressed in many countries. The aim of the study is to develop and examine an oral vaccine against COVID-19 with recombinant Lactococcus lactis IL1403, a strain of lactic acid bacteria, expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) S1 subunit as an immunizing antigen. PBS or cell extracts from recombinant L. lactis were orally administered into mice (control VS treatment), and formation of antigen-specific antibodies and changes in the gut microbiome were analyzed. Intracellular antigen was detected, but its secretion was not successful. After immunization, antigen-specific serum IgG and fecal IgA levels were 1.5-fold (P = 0.002) and 1.4-fold (P = 0.016) higher in the immunized mice (treatment) than control, respectively. Gut microbiome profiles were clearly separated between the two groups when analyzed for beta diversity with overall similarity. At the genus level, while Coprococcus (P = 0.036) and unclassified genus of Ruminococcaceae (P = 0.037) in treatment were more abundant than control, rc4-4 (P = 0.013) and Stenotrophomonas (P = 0.021) were less abundant. Our results indicate that cell extract containing SARS-CoV-2 antigen can induce mice to produce antigen-specific antibodies without overall changes in the gut microbiome. This strategy may be useful for the development of other oral viral vaccines.",
        "# Title: Oral Immunization With a M Cell-Targeting Recombinant L. Lactis Vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE Stimulate Protective Immunity Against H. Pylori in Mice.\n# Abstract: There are many virulence factors of H. pylori that contribute in diverse ways to gastric disease. Therefore, designing multivalent epitope vaccines against many key virulence factors virulence factors of H. pylori is a promising strategy to control H. pylori infection. In previous studies, we constructed a multivalent epitope vaccine FVpE against four key virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), and oral immunization with the FVpE vaccine plus a polysaccharide adjuvant (PA) containing lycium barbarum polysaccharide and chitosan could provide protection against H. pylori infection in the Mongolian gerbil model. Oral vaccines have many advantages over injected vaccines, such as improved safety and compliance, and easier manufacturing and administration. However, the harsh gastrointestinal (GI) environment, such as gastric acid and proteolytic enzymes, limits the development of oral vaccines to some extent. Oral vaccines need a gastrointestinal delivery system with high safety, low price and promoting vaccine antigen to stimulate immune response in the gastrointestinal mucosa. Lactic acid bacteria are gastrointestinal probiotics that have unique advantages as a delivery system for oral vaccines. In this study, a M cell-targeting surface display system for L. lactis named plSAM was designed to help vaccine antigens to stimulate effective immune responses in the gastrointestinal tract, and a M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE was constructed by using the surface display system plSAM. recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE could secretively express the SAM-FVpE protein and display it on the bacterial surface. Moreover, experimental results confirmed that LL-plSAM-FVpE had an enhanced M cell-targeting property. In addition, LL-plSAM-FVpE had excellent M cell-targeting property to promote the phagocytosis and transport of the antigen SAM-FVpE by gastrointestinal M cells. More importantly, oral immunization of LL-plSAM-FVpE or SAM-FVpE plus PA can stimulate IgG and sIgA antibodies and CD4+ T cell immune responses against four virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), thus providing protective immunity against H. pylori infection in mice. The M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine against various key H. pylori virulence factors could be a promising vaccine candidate for controlling H. pylori infection.",
        "# Title: Oral and intranasal immunization with food-grade recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing high conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein triggers mice's immunity responses.\n# Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic began at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread throughout the world. Vaccination is still the most effective method of prevention of pathogenic infections, including viral infections. However, there is little evidence that vaccination can protect against SARS-CoV-2 virus for a long time. Thus, regular re-vaccination is necessary to control COVID-19. Vaccination by injection is invasive, and is one of the reasons people refuse to get re-vaccinated. Therefore, we developed a less invasive vaccine based on oral or nasal administration. The gene encoding the high conserved region (HCR) spike protein was inserted into pNZ8149 and expressed in L.lactis NZ3900. Mice were immunized at 3-week intervals with oral or nasal routes. Anti-SARS-CoV2 spike antibody (IgG and IgA) level were measured using ELISA method before and after treatment. Plasma cells population in lymph were analyzed using flowcytometry and the CD4 + and CD8 + cells in lymph and intestine were analyzed using immunofluorescence method. The results of nasal and oral administration in experimental animals showed that L.lactis carrying the HCR gene could induce a humoral immune response, as indicated by increased levels of IgG and IgA against SARS-CoV-2 (IgG/IgA-SARS-CoV-2). The plasma cell population after nasal and oral vaccination in mice were significantly different with control group (p < 0.05). The CD4 + and CD8 + cells in intestine were significantly higher in orally immunized group mice than control group. The CD8 + cells in lymph were significantly higher in intranasal immunized group mice than control group. Our data demonstrate L.lactis expressing spike protein can be developed into a less invasive alternative to nasal and oral vaccination.",
        "# Title: Expanding strain coverage of a group A Streptococcus pilus-expressing Lactococcus lactis mucosal vaccine.\n# Abstract: Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a human pathogenic bacterium that can trigger a wide range of diseases, including the autoimmune diseases acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, causing major morbidity and mortality in many low- and middle-income countries. Primary intervention programs have had limited success thus far, and a licensed vaccine has yet to be developed. The pilus of GAS is known to be involved in host cell adhesion, biofilm formation and immune evasion. We have a mucosal vaccine in development that expresses the pilus of GAS on the surface of the nonpathogenic bacterium Lactococcus lactis. To expand strain coverage, we combined seven L. lactis constructs, each expressing a different GAS pilus variant, and investigated the systemic and mucosal immune responses following immunization. Mice immunized with this combination showed specific immunoglobin G and immunoglobin A responses to the GAS pilus proteins of vaccine strains, at levels comparable to mice immunized with a single construct. Cross-reactivity to pilus proteins of nonvaccine strains was also evident. Furthermore, protective efficacy against a homologous strain of GAS in a murine nasopharyngeal colonization model was observed. Overall, this study provides further evidence for using pilus-expressing lactic acid bacteria as a vaccine to prevent upper respiratory tract GAS infections."

The outcomes may be affected from variations in patterns of lymph node metastasis. As the patterns of lymph node sub-classifications, multiple station metastases of mediastinal lymph nodes (MN2), highest metastasis of the mediastinal lymph nodes (HM), distribution of metastatic nodes (skip N2 or non-skip N2), and clinical (c-) N factor have been cited. We investigated these factors for patients with pathological stage IIIA (pIIIA) N2 NSCLC. We reviewed 121 consecutive patients with pIIIA N2 who underwent complete resection.

LTBI is detected using interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) or the tuberculin-skin-test (TST). In clinical practice, IGRAs and the TSTs have failed to distinguish between active tuberculosis and LTBI and their predictive value to identify individuals at risk for the future development of tuberculosis is limited. There is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that improve the clinical performance of current immunodiagnostic methods for tuberculosis prevention, diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Here, we review the landscape of potential alternative biomarkers useful for detection of infection with M. tuberculosis. We describe what individual markers add in terms of specificity for active/latent infection, prediction of progression to active tuberculosis and immunodiagnostic potential in high-risk groups' such as HIV-infected individuals and children.",
        "# Title: Diagnostic performance of a cytokine and IFN-γ-induced chemokine mRNA assay after Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigen stimulation in whole blood from infected individuals.\n# Abstract: Interferon (IFN)-γ release assays have limited sensitivity and cannot differentiate between active tuberculosis (TB) disease and latent TB infection (LTBI). Numerous cytokines and regulator factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis and control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Additional cytokines and chemokines associated with M. tuberculosis infection may improve the performance of IFN-γ release assays. We developed a real-time RT-PCR TaqMan assay for targeting levels of eight human targets [IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-10, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11] and evaluated the assay with three different study groups. Results showed that the sensitivity of TNF-α, IL-2R, and CXCL10 in the active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) group was 96.43%, 96.43%, and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity of IL-2R and CXCL10 in the latent tuberculosis infection group was 86.36% and 81.82%, respectively. Statistical results showed that TNF-α and CXCL9 were the best individual markers for differentiating between the PTB, LTBI, and non-TB groups. For optimal sensitivity and differentiation of M. tuberculosis infection status, the simultaneous detection of multiple targets was attempted. The combination of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2R, and the combination of TNF-α, IL-2R, CXCL9, and CXCL10 showed the best performance for detecting active PTB (both 100% positivity) and LTBI (86.36% and 81.82% positivity, respectively). These results imply that the combination of suitable markers is useful in efficiently diagnosing TB and differentiating M. tuberculosis infection status.",

We evaluated the potentials of 74 host markers as biomarkers for the immunological diagnosis of tuberculosis and monitoring of treatment response. Fifty-five individuals that presented with signs and symptoms requiring investigation for tuberculosis disease were prospectively recruited prior to clinical diagnosis, at a health centre in Cape Town, South Africa. Patients were later classified as having tuberculosis disease or other respiratory diseases (ORD) using a combination of clinical, radiological and laboratory findings. Out of 74 host markers that were evaluated in plasma samples from study participants using a multiplex platform, 18 showed potential as tuberculosis diagnostic candidates with the most promising being NCAM, CRP, SAP, IP-10, ferritin, TPA, I-309, and MIG, which diagnosed tuberculosis disease individually, with area under the ROC curve ≥0.80. Six-marker biosignatures containing NCAM diagnosed tuberculosis disease with a sensitivity of 100% (95%CI, 86.3-100%) and specificity of 89.3% (95%CI, 67.6-97.3%) irrespective of HIV status, and 100% accuracy in the absence of HIV infection.

Seventy-nine individuals, 27 active TB, 32 latent infection subsets, 20 individuals derivative purified protein (PPD) negative (subjects that do not have any indurative cutaneous reaction after 72 hrs of intradermal injection of PPD) and with other pulmonary disease were retrospectively studied. Forty-eight analytes were evaluated by Luminex Assay in plasma obtained from whole blood stimulated cells. The diagnostic accuracies of the markers detected were evaluated by ROC curve analysis and by the combination of multiple biomarkers to improve the potential to discriminate between infection/disease and non infection. Among 48 cytokines, 13 analytes, namely IL-3, IL-12-p40, LIF, IFNα2, IL-2ra, IL-13, b-NGF, SCF, TNF-β, TRAIL, IL-2, IFN-γ, IP-10, and MIG, were significantly higher in the active TB and LTBI groups, compared to NON-TB patients, while MIF was significantly lower in active TB patients compared to NON-TB and LTBI groups. The diagnostic accuracies of the markers detected in the culture supernatants evaluated by ROC curve analysis revealed that 11 analytes (IL2, IP10, IFN-γ, IL13, MIG, SCF, b-NGF, IL12-p40, TRAIL, IL2 Ra, LIF) discriminated between NON-TB and LTBI groups, with AUC for all analytes ≥0.73, while 14 analytes (IL2, IP10, IFN-γ, MIG, SCF, b-NGF, IL12-p40, TRAIL, IL2Ra, MIF, TNF-β, IL3, IFN-α2, LIF) discriminated between NON-TB and active TB groups, with AUC ≥0.78, that is a moderate, value in terms of accuracy of a diagnostic test. Finally, the combinations of seven biomarkers resulted in the accurate prediction of 88.89% of active TB patients, 82.35% of subjects with latent infection and 90% of non-TB patients, respectively.

        "# Title: Associations of deceased donor kidney injury with kidney discard and function after transplantation.\n# Abstract: Deceased donor kidneys with acute kidney injury (AKI) are often discarded due to fear of poor outcomes. We performed a multicenter study to determine associations of AKI (increasing admission-to-terminal serum creatinine by AKI Network stages) with kidney discard, delayed graft function (DGF) and 6-month estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). In 1632 donors, kidney discard risk increased for AKI stages 1, 2 and 3 (compared to no AKI) with adjusted relative risks of 1.28 (1.08-1.52), 1.82 (1.45-2.30) and 2.74 (2.0-3.75), respectively. Adjusted relative risk for DGF also increased by donor AKI stage: 1.27 (1.09-1.49), 1.70 (1.37-2.12) and 2.25 (1.74-2.91), respectively. Six-month eGFR, however, was similar across AKI categories but was lower for recipients with DGF (48 [interquartile range: 31-61] vs. 58 [45-75] ml/min/1.73m(2) for no DGF, p < 0.001). There was significant favorable interaction between donor AKI and DGF such that 6-month eGFR was progressively better for DGF kidneys with increasing donor AKI (46 [29-60], 49 [32-64], 52 [36-59] and 58 [39-71] ml/min/1.73m(2) for no AKI, stage 1, 2 and 3, respectively; interaction p = 0.05). Donor AKI is associated with kidney discard and DGF, but given acceptable 6-month allograft function, clinicians should consider cautious expansion into this donor pool.",
        "# Title: Transplanting Kidneys from Deceased Donors With Severe Acute Kidney Injury.\n# Abstract: Our aim was to determine outcomes with transplanting kidneys from deceased donors with acute kidney injury, defined as a donor with terminal serum creatinine ≥2.0 mg/dL, or a donor requiring acute renal replacement therapy. We included all patients who received deceased donor kidney transplant from June 2004 to October 2013. There were 162 AKI donor transplant recipients (21% of deceased donor transplants): 139 in the standard criteria donor (SCD) and 23 in the expanded criteria donor (ECD) cohort. 71% of the AKI donors had stage 3 (severe AKI), based on acute kidney injury network (AKIN) staging. Protocol biopsies were done at 1, 4, and 12 months posttransplant. One and four month formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies from 48 patients (24 AKI donors, 24 non-AKI) underwent global gene expression profiling using DNA microarrays (96 arrays). DGF was more common in the AKI group but eGFR, graft survival at 1 year and proportion with IF/TA>2 at 1 year were similar for the two groups. At 1 month, there were 898 differentially expressed genes in the AKI group (p-value <0.005; FDR <10%), but by 4 months there were no differences. Transplanting selected kidneys from deceased donors with AKI is safe and has excellent outcomes.",

To determine whether this policy is justified, we analyzed outcomes of donor kidneys with acute kidney injury (AKI) in a large UK cohort. A retrospective analysis of the UK Transplant Registry evaluated deceased donors between 2003 and 2013. Donors were classified as no AKI, or AKI stage 1-3 according to Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Relationship of AKI with delayed graft function/primary nonfunction (DGF/PNF), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and graft-survival at 90 days and 1 year was analyzed. There were 11 219 kidneys (1869 [17%] with AKI) included. Graft failure at 1 year is greater for donors with AKI than for those without (graft survival 89% vs. 91%, p = 0.02; odds ratio (OR) 1.20 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.41]). DGF rates increase with donor AKI stage (p < 0.005), and PNF rates are significantly higher for AKIN stage 3 kidneys (9% vs. 4%, p = 0.04) Analysis of association between AKI and recipient eGFR suggests a risk of inferior eGFR with AKI versus no AKI (p < 0.005; OR 1.25 [95% CI: 1.08-1.31]). We report a small reduction in 1-year graft-survival of kidneys from donors with AKI. We conclude that AKI stage 1 or 2 kidneys should be used; however, caution is advised for AKI stage 3 donors.",

We aimed to evaluate the impact of donors' AKI severity and trend on graft outcomes in DDK transplantation. This was a retrospective study of DDK transplantation performed from 2005 to 2014. Based on maximum and terminal serum creatinine values before transplantation, the AKI trends were categorized as improving or worsening. Of 413 DDKs, 275 developed AKI: 177 stage 1, 52 stage 2, and 46 stage 3. DDKs with AKI had 212 improving AKI and 63 worsening AKI. Graft outcomes were similar based on AKI stage. Worsening AKI did not affect delayed graft function development; however, it significantly elevated graft failure risk even after adjusting for AKI stage and Kidney Donor Risk Index. Graft survival of the improving group was similar to DDKs with no AKI. This study showed that AKI severity of DDKs did not affect overall graft outcomes. Notably, DDKs with improving AKI showed a similar graft survival rate to DDKs without AKI, although worsening AKI had a worse prognosis. Consideration of the AKI trend, rather than its severity, is needed when DDKs with AKI are allocated.",

We performed a multicenter study to determine associations between donor AKI (from none to severe based on AKI Network stages) and all-cause graft failure, adjusting for donor, transplant, and recipient factors. We examined whether any of the following factors modified the relationship between donor AKI and graft survival: kidney donor profile index, cold ischemia time, donation after cardiac death, expanded-criteria donation, kidney machine perfusion, donor-recipient gender combinations, or delayed graft function. We also evaluated the association between donor AKI and a 3-year composite outcome of all-cause graft failure or estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 in a subcohort of 30% of recipients. Among 2,430 kidneys transplanted from 1,298 deceased donors, 585 (24%) were from donors with AKI. Over a median follow-up of 4.0 years, there were no significant differences in graft survival by donor AKI stage. We found no evidence that pre-specified variables modified the effect of donor AKI on graft survival. In the subcohort, donor AKI was not associated with the 3-year composite outcome. Donor AKI was not associated with graft failure in this well-phenotyped cohort. Given the organ shortage, the transplant community should consider measures to increase utilization of kidneys from deceased donors with AKI.",
        "# Title: Success of kidney transplantations from deceased donors with acute kidney injury.\n# Abstract: BACKGROUND The acceptance of organs from deceased donors with acute kidney injury (AKI) varies considerably, with uncertain outcomes. The current organ shortage has led to increased use of marginal donor organs. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective, single-center study included 642 patients who underwent kidney allograft transplantation between 2005 and 2016. The recipients were categorized into 3 groups: AKI-1 (n=214), comprising donors with a peak serum creatinine (SCr) level of 1.1-2.0 mg/dl; AKI-2 (n=89), comprising donors with a peak SCr level >2 mg/dl; and non-AKI (n=339), comprising donors with normal kidney function (SCr <1.1 mg/dl). RESULTS The cumulative survival rates for patients and grafts did not significantly differ among the AKI-1, AKI-2, and non-AKI groups at the 1-year (91.6%/79.4%, 92.1%/83.1%, 95.3%/88.5%, respectively) and 5-year assessments (79.4%/67.8%, 86.8%/71.7%, 80.5%/71.1%, respectively). These findings were corroborated by mean SCr values and estimated glomerular filtration rates at the 1-year (2.08±1.7/51.16±23.45, 2.01±1.52/56.46±23.63, 1.81±1.13/55.44±23.26 mg/dl, respectively) and 5-year assessments (1.91±1.28/51.06±24.65, 1.74±0.66/57.44±31.21, 1.7±0.88/58.56±26.04 mg/dl, respectively). The incidence of delayed graft function in each group was 29.9%, 44.9%, and 28.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Kidney transplantation from donors with AKI, although associated with a higher rate of delayed graft function, results in good long-term transplant survival and reliable kidney functionality after 5 years. The inclusion of donors with AKI may widely extend the pool of available organs; however, careful donor selection is necessary.",

We investigated the effect of donor AKI on renal function and chronic changes on protocol biopsies at 1-year post-transplant. Donor AKI was defined according to Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Between 2013 and 2017, 333 kidneys were transplanted and subsequently biopsied after 1 year. Fifty-three kidneys from AKI donors (AKIN stage I n = 42, stage II n = 8, stage III n = 3) were compared to 280 kidneys from non-AKI donors. At 1-year follow-up, patient and graft survival were comparable. Donor AKI was not predictive of IFTA (Banff interstitial fibrosis plus tubular atrophy scores) at 1-year post-transplant biopsy (2.10 ± 1.28 in AKI, 2.09 ± 1.22 in non-AKI, P = .95). Donor AKI was also not associated with progression of IFTA from 3 to 12 months (P = .69), or inferior glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, P = .94). In a multivariate analysis, the odds of IFTA >2 were comparable between AKI and non-AKI groups. In conclusion, the transplantation of kidneys from donors with predominantly stage I AKI results in comparable function and degree of fibrosis on protocol biopsies 1-year post-transplant. Selected grafts from donors with AKI are a valuable tool for expanding the donor pool for kidney transplantation.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate how kidney transplantation (KT) from a donor with AKI affects long-term graft survival in various situations. All patients who underwent KT from DBD donors between June 2003 and April 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. The KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) criteria were used to classify donor AKI. The cohort included 376 donors (no AKI group, n = 117 [31.1%]; AKI group n = 259 [68.9%]). Death-censored graft survival was similar according to the presence of AKI, AKI severity, and the AKI trend (p = 0.929, p = 0.077, and p = 0.658, respectively). Patients whose donors had AKI who received using low dose (1.5 mg/kg for three days) rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (r-ATG) as the induction agent had significantly superior death-censored graft survival compared with patients in that group who received basiliximab (p = 0.039).

Although previous studies comparing clinical outcomes between AKI and non-AKI donors in KTs have shown comparable results, data on high-volume analysis of KTs outcomes with AKI donors are limited. This study aimed to analyze the selection trends of AKI donors and investigate the impact of AKI on graft failure using the United states cohort data. We analyzed a total 52,757 KTs collected in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipient (SRTR) from 2010 to 2015. The sample included 4,962 (9.4%) cases of KTs with AKI donors (creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dL). Clinical characteristics of AKI and non-AKI donors were analyzed and outcomes of both groups were compared. We also analyzed risk factors for graft failure in AKI donor KTs. Although the incidence of delayed graft function was higher in recipients of AKI donors compared to non-AKI donors, graft and patient survival were not significantly different between the two groups. We found donor hypertension, cold ischemic time, the proportion of African American donors, and high KDPI were risk factors for graft failure in AKI donor KTs. KTs from deceased donor with AKI showed comparable outcomes. Thus, donors with AKI need to be considered more actively to expand donor pool.

Positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]FDDNP and the determination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of these proteins constitute a means to visualize in vivo Aβ and tau brain accumulation. Information about longitudinal changes of these CSF and PET biomarkers in PD with regard to progression to dementia is lacking. We assessed the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of CSF and PET biomarkers of tau and Aβ with PD-related cognitive dysfunction in 6 healthy-controls (HC), 16 patients with PD without dementia (PDND), and 8 PD with dementia (PDD). All subjects underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing, [18F]FDDNP PET, and CSF Aβ-tau determination. After 18 months, the PDND group was re-assessed clinically and by neuropsychological, PET, and CSF determinations. Cross-sectionally, PDD had higher [18F]FDDNP binding in lateral temporal regions and lower levels of CSF Aβ levels compared to PDND, with a congruent correlation between the [18F]FDDNP binding and CSF Aβ levels. Longitudinally, higher baseline lateral temporal [18F]FDDNP binding was associated to longitudinal worsening in cognitive performances and progression to dementia among subjects classified as PDND at baseline, who additionally disclosed at follow-up an increase in lateral-temporal FDDNP binding, as well as a reduction in CSF Aβ and an increase in CSF tau levels.

While many parkinsonian disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia, and multiple system atrophy are classified as synucleinopathies, progressive supranuclear palsy is coined a tauopathy due to the aggregation of pathological tau in the brain. [18F]AV-1451 (also known as [18F]-T807) is a positron emission tomography radiotracer that binds to paired helical filaments of tau in Alzheimer's disease. We investigated whether [18F]AV-1451 could be used as biomarker for the diagnosis and disease progression monitoring in progressive supranuclear palsy. Six progressive supranuclear palsy, six Parkinson's disease, and 10 age-matched healthy controls were recruited.

[18F]AV-1451 is a positron emission tomography radiotracer designed to bind pathological tau. A post-mortem study using [18F]AV-1451 discovered off-target binding properties to neuromelanin in the substantia nigra. A subsequent clinical study reported a 30% decrease in [18F]AV-1451 binding in the midbrain of PD patients. A total of 12 patients and 10 healthy age-matched controls were recruited. An anatomical MRI and a 90-min PET scan, using [18F]AV-1451, were acquired from all participants. The standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) from 60 to 90 min post-injection was calculated for the substantia nigra, using the cerebellar cortex as the reference region.

        "# Title: 18F-AV-1451 in Parkinson's Disease with and without dementia and in Dementia with Lewy Bodies.\n# Abstract: Mixed pathologies of α-synuclein, β-amyloid and tau are relatively common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). We therefore wanted to study the retention patterns of 18F-AV-1451 in PD, PD-dementia (PDD), and DLB. To do this 44 healthy controls, 11 non-demented patients with PD, 18 patients with PDD, and six patients with DLB underwent MRI and 18F-AV-1451 PET scanning and cognitive testing. We found that parietal 18F-AV-1451 retention was increased in patients with DLB compared to controls and PD patients, while 18F-AV-1451 uptake was reduced in the substantia nigra in PDD. Increased parietal 18F-AV-1451 PET uptake was associated with impaired performance on verbal fluency tests, and the decreased uptake in the substantia nigra correlated with worse motor function. We found no effect of the monoamine oxidase B inhibitor rasagiline on 18F-AV-1451 binding. In conclusion DLB patients have increased parietal 18F-AV-1451 uptake. Increased parietal tau is associated with executive impairment in patients with synucleinopathies, while decreased uptake in the substantia nigra is associated with parkinsonism. Further, our data indicate that 18F-AV-1451 does not significantly bind to MAO-B in vivo.",

        "# Title: PET Imaging of Astrogliosis and Tau Facilitates Diagnosis of Parkinsonian Syndromes.\n# Abstract: Neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes comprise a number of disorders that are characterized by similar clinical features but are separated on the basis of different pathologies, i.e., aggregates of α-synuclein or tau protein. Due to the overlap of signs and symptoms a precise differentiation is often difficult, especially early in the disease course. Enormous efforts have been taken to develop tau-selective PET imaging agents, but strong off-target binding to monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) has been observed across first generation ligands. Nonetheless, astrogliosis-related MAO-B elevation is a common histopathological known feature of all parkinsonian syndromes and might be itself an interesting imaging target. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the performance of [18F]-THK5351, a combined MAO-B and tau tracer for differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes. [18F]-THK5351 PET was performed in 34 patients: six with Parkinson's disease (PD), nine with multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P), six with MSA with predominant cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C), and 13 with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) Richardson's syndrome. Volume-of-interest-based quantification of standardized-uptake-values was conducted in different parkinsonian syndrome-related target regions. PET results were subjected to multinomial logistic regression to create a prediction model discriminating among groups. Furthermore, we correlated tracer uptake with clinical findings. Elevated [18F]-THK5351 uptake in midbrain and diencephalon differentiated PSP patients from PD and MSA-C. MSA-C patients were distinguishable by high tracer uptake in the pons and cerebellar deep white matter when compared to PSP and PD patients, whereas MSA-P patients tended to show higher tracer uptake in the lentiform nucleus. A multinomial logistic regression classified 33/34 patients into the correct clinical diagnosis group. Tracer uptake in the pons, cerebellar deep white matter, and striatum was closely associated with the presence of cerebellar and parkinsonian symptoms of MSA patients. The current study demonstrates that combined MAO-B and tau binding of THK5351 facilitates differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes. Furthermore, our data indicate a correlation of MSA phenotype with [18F]-THK5351 uptake in certain brain regions, illustrating their relevance for the emergence of clinical symptoms and underlining the potential of THK5351 PET as a biomarker that correlates with pathological changes as well as with disease stage.",

We aimed to investigate its performance in combination with plasma tau levels in patients with non-AD tauopathy. Methods: A total of 47 participants were enrolled, including 10 healthy controls, 16 with tauopathy parkinsonism syndromes (9 with corticobasal syndrome [CBS], 7 with progressive supranuclear palsy [PSP]), 9 with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 4 with AD, and 8 with Parkinson's disease (PD). All participants underwent clinical assessments, 18F-T807 tau PET, brain MRI, and plasma tau assay. Results: The global cortical standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) of 18F-T807 PET was comparable between PD and control (p = 0.088). The cortical SUVR was significantly higher in AD group (p = 0.002) but was modestly increased in PSP group compared to the PD group (p = 0.044), especially in parietal and pallidal regions. Asymmetric 18F-T807 uptake at the pallidum was noted in patients with CBS and FTD. Cortical tau tracer uptake was associated with increased plasma total tau level (p = 0.016), especially in frontal and parietal regions. Regional tracer uptake was correlated with cortical thinning in patients with CBS and PSP (CBS: r = -0.092, p = 0.025; PSP: r = -0.114, p = 0.015). Conclusions: The 18F-T807 tau tracer uptake was only modestly increased in patients with PSP. Although the cortical tau tracer uptake correlated with regional cortical atrophy and plasma tau levels, a four-repeated tau-specific tracer is needed for future classifying tauopathy parkinsonism syndromes.",

The outcomes may be affected from variations in patterns of lymph node metastasis.

Sequence-influenced methylations were described in T2DM-associated genomic regions, but evidence for direct, sequence-independent association with disease risk is missing. Here, we explore disease-contributing DNA methylation through a stepwise study design: first, a pool-based, genome-scale screen among 1169 case and control individuals revealed an excess of differentially methylated sites in genomic regions that were previously associated with T2DM through genetic studies. Next, in-depth analyses were performed at selected top-ranking regions. A CpG site in the first intron of the FTO gene showed small (3.35%) but significant (P = 0.000021) hypomethylation of cases relative to controls. The effect was independent of the sequence polymorphism in the region and persists among individuals carrying the sequence-risk alleles. The odds of belonging to the T2DM group increased by 6.1% for every 1% decrease in methylation (OR = 1.061, 95% CI: 1.032-1.090), the odds ratio for decrease of 1 standard deviation of methylation (adjusted to gender) was 1.5856 (95% CI: 1.2824-1.9606) and the sensitivity (area under the curve = 0.638, 95% CI: 0.586-0.690; males = 0.675, females = 0.609) was better than that of the strongest known sequence variant. Furthermore, a prospective study in an independent population cohort revealed significant hypomethylation of young individuals that later progressed to T2DM, relative to the individuals who stayed healthy. Further genomic analysis revealed co-localization with gene enhancers and with binding sites for methylation-sensitive transcriptional regulators. The data showed that low methylation level at the analyzed sites is an early marker of T2DM and suggests a novel mechanism by which early-onset, inter-individual methylation variation at isolated non-promoter genomic sites predisposes to T2DM.",

Epigenetic changes may provide the link for translating environmental exposures into pathological mechanisms. In this study, we performed the first comprehensive DNA methylation profiling in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We uncovered 276 CpG loci affiliated to promoters of 254 genes displaying significant differential DNA methylation in diabetic islets. These methylation changes were not present in blood cells from T2D individuals nor were they experimentally induced in non-diabetic islets by exposure to high glucose. For a subgroup of the differentially methylated genes, concordant transcriptional changes were present. Functional annotation of the aberrantly methylated genes and RNAi experiments highlighted pathways implicated in β-cell survival and function; some are implicated in cellular dysfunction while others facilitate adaptation to stressors. Together, our findings offer new insights into the intricate mechanisms of T2D pathogenesis, underscore the important involvement of epigenetic dysregulation in diabetic islets and may advance our understanding of T2D aetiology.",

Epigenetics may affect disease susceptibility. To describe the human methylome in pancreatic islets and determine the epigenetic basis of T2D, we analyzed DNA methylation of 479,927 CpG sites and the transcriptome in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We provide a detailed map of the global DNA methylation pattern in human islets, β- and α-cells. Genomic regions close to the transcription start site showed low degrees of methylation and regions further away from the transcription start site such as the gene body, 3'UTR and intergenic regions showed a higher degree of methylation. While CpG islands were hypomethylated, the surrounding 2 kb shores showed an intermediate degree of methylation, whereas regions further away (shelves and open sea) were hypermethylated in human islets, β- and α-cells. We identified 1,649 CpG sites and 853 genes, including TCF7L2, FTO and KCNQ1, with differential DNA methylation in T2D islets after correction for multiple testing. The majority of the differentially methylated CpG sites had an intermediate degree of methylation and were underrepresented in CpG islands (∼ 7%) and overrepresented in the open sea (∼ 60%). 102 of the differentially methylated genes, including CDKN1A, PDE7B, SEPT9 and EXOC3L2, were differentially expressed in T2D islets. Methylation of CDKN1A and PDE7B promoters in vitro suppressed their transcriptional activity. Functional analyses demonstrated that identified candidate genes affect pancreatic β- and α-cells as Exoc3l silencing reduced exocytosis and overexpression of Cdkn1a, Pde7b and Sept9 perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion in clonal β- and α-cells, respectively. Together, our data can serve as a reference methylome in human islets. We provide new target genes with altered DNA methylation and expression in human T2D islets that contribute to perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion. These results highlight the importance of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of T2D.",
        "# Title: Altered DNA methylation and differential expression of genes influencing metabolism and inflammation in adipose tissue from subjects with type 2 diabetes.\n# Abstract: Genetics, epigenetics, and environment may together affect the susceptibility for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our aim was to dissect molecular mechanisms underlying T2D using genome-wide expression and DNA methylation data in adipose tissue from monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D and independent case-control cohorts. In adipose tissue from diabetic twins, we found decreased expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation; carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism; and increased expression of genes involved in inflammation and glycan degradation. The most differentially expressed genes included ELOVL6, GYS2, FADS1, SPP1 (OPN), CCL18, and IL1RN. We replicated these results in adipose tissue from an independent case-control cohort. Several candidate genes for obesity and T2D (e.g., IRS1 and VEGFA) were differentially expressed in discordant twins. We found a heritable contribution to the genome-wide DNA methylation variability in twins. Differences in methylation between monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D were subsequently modest. However, 15,627 sites, representing 7,046 genes including PPARG, KCNQ1, TCF7L2, and IRS1, showed differential DNA methylation in adipose tissue from unrelated subjects with T2D compared with control subjects. A total of 1,410 of these sites also showed differential DNA methylation in the twins discordant for T2D. For the differentially methylated sites, the heritability estimate was 0.28. We also identified copy number variants (CNVs) in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D. Taken together, subjects with T2D exhibit multiple transcriptional and epigenetic changes in adipose tissue relevant to the development of the disease.",
        "# Title: An integrated epigenomic analysis for type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci in monozygotic twins.\n# Abstract: DNA methylation has a great potential for understanding the aetiology of common complex traits such as Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here we perform genome-wide methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) in whole-blood-derived DNA from 27 monozygotic twin pairs and follow up results with replication and integrated omics analyses. We identify predominately hypermethylated T2D-related differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and replicate the top signals in 42 unrelated T2D cases and 221 controls. The strongest signal is in the promoter of the MALT1 gene, involved in insulin and glycaemic pathways, and related to taurocholate levels in blood. Integrating the DNA methylome findings with T2D GWAS meta-analysis results reveals a strong enrichment for DMRs in T2D-susceptibility loci. We also detect signals specific to T2D-discordant twins in the GPR61 and PRKCB genes. These replicated T2D associations reflect both likely causal and consequential pathways of the disease. The analysis indicates how an integrated genomics and epigenomics approach, utilizing an MZ twin design, can provide pathogenic insights as well as potential drug targets and biomarkers for T2D and other complex traits.",

Using Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays, we tested for association of DNA methylation at 446 356 sites with age, sex and phenotypic traits related to T2D in 850 pedigreed Mexican-American individuals. Robust statistical analyses showed that (i) 15% of the methylome is significantly heritable, with a median heritability of 0.14; (ii) DNA methylation at 14% of CpG sites is associated with nearby sequence variants; (iii) 22% and 3% of the autosomal CpG sites are associated with age and sex, respectively; (iv) 53 CpG sites were significantly associated with liability to T2D, fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance; (v) DNA methylation levels at five CpG sites, mapping to three well-characterized genes (TXNIP, ABCG1 and SAMD12) independently explained 7.8% of the heritability of T2D (vi) methylation at these five sites was unlikely to be influenced by neighboring DNA sequence variation.

Hepatic insulin resistance is a hallmark of T2D. However, it remains unknown whether epigenetic alterations take place in the liver from diabetic subjects. Therefore, we investigated the genome-wide DNA methylation pattern in the liver from subjects with T2D and nondiabetic controls and related epigenetic alterations to gene expression and circulating folate levels.",

        "# Title: Epigenome-wide association study identifies TXNIP gene associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and sustained hyperglycemia.\n# Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is an established risk factor for a wide range of vascular diseases, including ischemic stroke (IS). Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a marker for average blood glucose levels over the previous 12 weeks, is used as a measure of glycemic control and also as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes (HbA1c levels ≥ 6.5%). Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, may be associated with aging processes and with modulation of the risk of various pathologies, such as DM. Specifically, DNA methylation could be one of the mechanisms mediating the relation between DM and environmental exposures. Our goal was to identify new CpG methylation sites associated with DM. We performed a genome-wide methylation study in whole-blood DNA from an IS patient cohorts. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array was used to measure DNA methylation in CpG sites. All statistical analyses were adjusted for sex, age, hyperlipidemia, body mass index (BMI), smoking habit and cell count. Findings were replicated in two independent cohorts, an IS cohort and a population-based cohort, using the same array. In the discovery phase (N = 355), we identified a CpG site, cg19693031 (located in the TXNIP gene) that was associated with DM (P = 1.17 × 10(-12)); this CpG was replicated in two independent cohorts (N = 167 and N = 645). Methylation of TXNIP was inversely and intensely associated with HbA1c levels (P = 7.3 × 10(-16)), specifically related to diabetic patients with poor control of glucose levels. We identified an association between the TXNIP gene and DM through epigenetic mechanisms, related to sustained hyperglycemia levels (HbA1c ≥ 7%).",

Here we examine whether age-related epigenetic changes affect human islet function and if blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect these changes and associate with future T2D. We analyse DNA methylation genome-wide in islets from 87 non-diabetic donors, aged 26-74 years. Aging associates with increased DNA methylation of 241 sites. These sites cover loci previously associated with T2D, for example, KLF14. Blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related methylation changes in 83 genes identified in human islets (for example, KLF14, FHL2, ZNF518B and FAM123C) and some associate with insulin secretion and T2D. DNA methylation correlates with islet expression of multiple genes, including FHL2, ZNF518B, GNPNAT1 and HLTF. Silencing these genes in β-cells alter insulin secretion. Together, we demonstrate that blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related DNA methylation changes in human islets, and associate with insulin secretion in vivo and T2D.",

To conduct a genome-wide DNA methylation in individuals with type 2 diabetes, individuals with prediabetes, and control mixed ancestry individuals from South Africa. Methods. We used peripheral blood to perform genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in 3 individuals with screen detected diabetes, 3 individuals with prediabetes, and 3 individuals with normoglycaemia from the Bellville South Community, Cape Town, South Africa, who were age-, gender-, body mass index-, and duration of residency-matched. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) was performed by Arraystar Inc. (Rockville, MD, USA). Results. Hypermethylated DMRs were 1160 (81.97%) and 124 (43.20%), respectively, in individuals with diabetes and prediabetes when both were compared to subjects with normoglycaemia. Our data shows that genes related to the immune system, signal transduction, glucose transport, and pancreas development have altered DNA methylation in subjects with prediabetes and diabetes. Pathway analysis based on the functional analysis mapping of genes to KEGG pathways suggested that the linoleic acid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism pathways are hypomethylated in prediabetes and diabetes. Conclusions. Our study suggests that epigenetic changes are likely to be an early process that occurs before the onset of overt diabetes. Detailed analysis of DMRs that shows gradual methylation differences from control versus prediabetes to prediabetes versus diabetes in a larger sample size is required to confirm these findings.",
        "# Title: Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing of Human Pancreatic Islets Reveals Novel Differentially Methylated Regions in Type 2 Diabetes Pathogenesis.\n# Abstract: Current knowledge about the role of epigenetics in type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains limited. Only a few studies have investigated DNA methylation of selected candidate genes or a very small fraction of genomic CpG sites in human pancreatic islets, the tissue of primary pathogenic importance for diabetes. Our aim was to characterize the whole-genome DNA methylation landscape in human pancreatic islets, to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in diabetic islets, and to investigate the function of DMRs in islet biology. Here, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, which is a comprehensive and unbiased method to study DNA methylation throughout the genome at a single nucleotide resolution, in pancreatic islets from donors with T2D and control subjects without diabetes. We identified 25,820 DMRs in islets from individuals with T2D. These DMRs cover loci with known islet function, e.g., PDX1, TCF7L2, and ADCY5 Importantly, binding sites previously identified by ChIP-seq for islet-specific transcription factors, enhancer regions, and different histone marks were enriched in the T2D-associated DMRs. We also identified 457 genes, including NR4A3, PARK2, PID1, SLC2A2, and SOCS2, that had both DMRs and significant expression changes in T2D islets. To mimic the situation in T2D islets, candidate genes were overexpressed or silenced in cultured β-cells. This resulted in impaired insulin secretion, thereby connecting differential methylation to islet dysfunction. We further explored the islet methylome and found a strong link between methylation levels and histone marks. Additionally, DNA methylation in different genomic regions and of different transcript types (i.e., protein coding, noncoding, and pseudogenes) was associated with islet expression levels. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the islet DNA methylome in individuals with and without diabetes and highlights the importance of epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets and T2D pathogenesis."

        "# Title: Standard assessments of frailty are validated predictors of mortality in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis.\n# Abstract: The risk of morbidity and mortality for hospitalized patients with cirrhosis is high and incompletely captured by conventional indices. We sought to evaluate the predictive role of frailty in an observational cohort study of inpatients with decompensated cirrhosis between 2010 and 2013. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included discharge to a rehabilitation hospital, 30-day readmission, and length of stay. Frailty was assessed with three metrics: activities of daily living (ADL), the Braden Scale, and the Morse fall risk score. A predictive model was validated by randomly dividing the population into training and validation cohorts: 734 patients were admitted 1358 times in the study period. The overall 90-day mortality was 18.3%. The 30-day readmission rate was 26.6%, and the rate of discharge to a rehabilitation facility was 14.3%. Adjusting for sex, age, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, sodium, and Charlson index, the odds ratio for the effect of an ADL score of less than 12 of 15 on mortality is 1.83 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-3.20). A predictive model for 90-day mortality including ADL and Braden Scale yielded C statistics of 0.83 (95% CI 0.80-0.86) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.71-0.83) in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Discharge to a rehabilitation hospital is predicted by both the ADL (<12) and Braden Scale (<16), with respective adjusted odds ratios of 3.78 (95% CI 1.97-7.29) and 6.23 (95% CI 2.53-15.4). Length of stay was associated with the Braden Scale (<16) (hazard ratio = 0.63, 95% CI 0.44-0.91). No frailty measure was associated with 30-day readmission.",

However, for patients with compensated disease, data are limited regarding associations with poor patient-reported outcomes (PROs). We prospectively enrolled 300 patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension without a history of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and reviewed medical and pharmacy records. We characterized determinants of PROs using the 8-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-8) scale (0-100) and sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; poor sleep >5). Disability and frailty measures were assessed using activities of daily living (ADLs), falls, hand-grip, and chair-stands. Cognitive function was measured using weighted-lures from the Inhibitory Control Test (ICT). The median age of our cohort was 60 (interquartile range [IQR], 52-66) years, 56.3% were male, and 70% Child class A. All patients had portal hypertension, 76% had varices, and 41% had a history of ascites (predominantly well controlled). The median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease with Sodium (MELD-Na) score was 9 (IQR, 7-13). The overall median SF-8 was 70 (IQR, 54-86). Multivariate analysis showed that after adjusting for age, sex, education, and MELD-Na, performance on chair-stands (9.28 HRQOL points [95% confidence interval {CI}, 4.76-13.8] per 10-stands), ADL dependence (-6.06 [-10.8 to -1.36]), opiate use (-5.01 [-7.84 to -2.19]), benzodiazepine use (-3.50 [-6.58 to -0.42]), and ICT performance (-0.10 [-0.20 to 0.001] per weighted-lure) were significantly associated with HRQOL. Among patients completing the ICT, poor HRQOL (score <50) was significantly associated with chair-stands (odds ratio [OR] per 10-stands, 0.24; 95% CI [0.11-0.56]) and weighted lures (OR per weighted-lure, 1.01 [1.00-1.03]). Poor sleep quality was associated with opiate use (OR, 2.85 [1.11-7.29]) and lures (OR per-lure, 1.03 [1.00-1.05]). Conclusion: Disability, chair-stand performance, cognitive dysfunction, as well as psychoactive medication use are significantly associated with PROs in patients with clinically stable cirrhosis.",

        "# Title: Frailty Is a Risk Factor for Postoperative Mortality in Patients With Cirrhosis Undergoing Diverse Major Surgeries.\n# Abstract: With a rising burden of cirrhosis surgeries, understanding risk factors for postoperative mortality is more salient than ever. The role of baseline frailty has not been assessed in this context. We evaluated the association between patient frailty and postoperative risk among diverse patients with cirrhosis and determined if frailty improves prognostication of cirrhosis surgical risk scores. This was a retrospective cohort study of U.S. veterans with cirrhosis identified between 2008 and 2016 who underwent nontransplant major surgery. Frailty was ascertained using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS). Cox regression analysis was used to investigate the impact of patient frailty on postoperative mortality. Logistic regression was used to identify incremental changes in discrimination for postoperative mortality when frailty was added to the risk prediction models, including the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), MELD-sodium (MELD-Na), Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP), Mayo Risk Score (MRS), and Veterans Outcomes and Costs Associated With Liver Disease (VOCAL)-Penn. A total of 804 cirrhosis surgeries were identified. The majority of patients (48.5%) had high-risk frailty at baseline (HFRS >15). In adjusted Cox regression models, categories of increasing frailty scores were associated with poorer postoperative survival. For example, intermediate-risk frailty (HFRS 5-15) conferred a 1.77-fold increased hazard relative to low-risk frailty (HFRS, <5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-2.95; P = 0.03). High-risk frailty demonstrated a similarly increased hazard (hazard ratio, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.05-2.88; P = 0.03), suggesting a threshold effect of frailty on postoperative mortality. The incorporation of frailty improved discrimination of MELD, MELD-Na, and CTP for postoperative mortality, but did not do so for the MRS or VOCAL-Penn score. Patient frailty was an additional important predictor of cirrhosis surgical risk. The incorporation of preoperative frailty assessments may help to risk stratify patients, especially in settings where the MELD-Na and CTP are commonly applied.",

We examined the feasibility of inpatient frailty measurements and associations with nonhome discharge, readmission, and all-cause mortality among patients admitted for cirrhosis complications. We conducted a prospective study at 3 liver transplantation (LT) centers. Frailty was assessed using the liver frailty index (LFI). Multivariable logistic and competing risk models evaluated associations between frailty and clinical outcomes. We included 211 patients with median MELD-Na score 21 (interquartile range [IQR],15-27); 96 (45%) were women, and 102 (48%) were on the LT waiting list. At a median follow-up of 8.3 months, 29 patients (14%) were nonhome discharged, 144 (68%) were readmitted, 70 (33%) underwent LT, and 44 (21%) died. A total of 124 patients (59%) were frail, with a median LFI of 4.71 (IQR, 4.07-5.54). Frail patients were older (mean, 59 versus 54 years) and more likely to have chronic kidney disease (40% versus 20%; P = 0.002) and coronary artery disease (17% versus 7%; P = 0.03). Frailty was associated with hospital-acquired infections (8% versus 1%; P = 0.02). In multivariable models, LFI was associated with nonhome discharge (odds ratio, 1.81 per 1-point increase; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-2.86). Frailty (LFI≥4.5) was associated with all-cause mortality in models accounting for LT as competing risk (subhazard ratio [sHR], 2.4; 95% CI, 1.13-5.11); results were similar with LFI as a continuous variable (sHR, 1.62 per 1-point increase; 95% CI, 1.15-2.28). A brief, objective inpatient frailty assessment was feasible and predicted nonhome discharge and mortality in decompensated cirrhosis. Inpatient point-of-care frailty assessment prior to hospital discharge can be useful for risk stratification and targeted interventions to improve physical fitness and reduce adverse outcomes.",

        "# Title: Health-Related Quality of Life and Its Contributors According to a Preference-Based Generic Instrument in Cirrhosis.\n# Abstract: It is essential to determine contributors around impairment in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with cirrhosis aiming at improving health care and therapeutic strategy. Studies simultaneously incorporating disease severity based on biochemical parameters and other physical/psychological effects (i.e., sleep disturbance and frailty) are heterogeneous and the subject of the present study. We analyzed and compared HRQoL, using the EuroQol Group 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire and the utility index retrieved, in patients with cirrhosis and across groups stratified by sleep disturbance or frailty phenotype. Sleep disturbance and frailty were determined by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Frailty Index, respectively. Multiple linear regression was implemented to clarify contributors of poor HRQoL. In this cohort of 227 patients with mean age of 61.7 years and 47.2% male, more than half of the study population represented impairment in HRQoL in at least one domain, according to EQ-5D. Furthermore, sleep disturbance and frailty have proved to be independently associated with poor HRQoL in two separate regression models, whereas conventional scoring systems such as Child-Pugh classification and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease are not closely relevant. Intriguingly, not all health domains within EQ-5D correlated well with PSQI and Frailty Index, with the exception of usual activities. Pain and anxiety/depression were the most frequently affected HRQoL domains even in patients without sleep disturbance or frailty. Conclusion: Impaired HRQoL is prevalent in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Sleep disturbance and frailty are independently associated with poor HRQoL. It is imperative to timely intervene with these symptoms and deliver tailored health care.",

        "# Title: Liver Frailty Index for Prediction of Short-Term Rehospitalization in Patients with Liver Cirrhosis.\n# Abstract: Background: Stratifying patients with liver cirrhosis for risk of rehospitalization is challenging with established scoring systems for chronic liver disease. Frailty captures the physical characteristics of patients with cirrhosis. Its value for predicting short-term rehospitalizations in hospitalized patients remains to be defined. Methods: Eighty-three non-electively hospitalized patients with liver cirrhosis were analyzed in this study. Frailty was assessed during the last 48 h of hospital stay with the liver frailty index (LFI). Patients were followed for 30-day rehospitalization. Results: In total, 26 (31%) patients were rehospitalized within 30 days. The median LFI was 4.5, and 43 (52%) patients were identified as frail. Rehospitalized patients had a significant higher LFI compared to patients without a rehospitalization within 30 days. In multivariable analysis, LFI as a metric variable (OR 2.36, p = 0.02) and lower platelet count (OR 0.98, p < 0.01) were independently associated with rehospitalization. LFI and its subtest chair stands had the best discriminative ability to predict rehospitalization, with AUROCs of 0.66 and 0.67, respectively. An LFI cut-off of >4.62 discriminated best between patients with and without elevated risk for rehospitalization within 30 days. Conclusions: Measures of frailty could be useful to identify patients at higher risk for short-term rehospitalization.",

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a cross-sectional study involving individuals aged 32 to 69 years, all diagnosed with liver cirrhosis. The chronic liver disease questionnaire (CLDQ) was used to assess HR-QoL, the CLDQ score was used as an outcome to measure the factors related to HR-QoL, and the liver frailty index (LFI) was used to assess the frailty status. The association between the frailty status and the CLDQ summary scales was investigated using the correlation coefficient and multiple regression analyses. A total of 138 patients in the frail (n = 62) and non-frail (n = 76) groups with (alcohol: 97; viral: 24; autoimmune: 17; and cryptogenic: 12) were included in the study.

Here, we present data from a retrospective analysis using PET/CT and PET/MRI examinations to investigate the efficacy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET for primary N-staging of patients with prostate cancer (PC) compared with morphologic imaging (CT or MRI) and validated by histopathology. Methods: Data from 58 patients with high-risk PC (according to the D'Amico criteria) who were staged with 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET/CT or PET/MRI at our institution between July 2017 and June 2018 were reviewed. The patients had a median prescan prostate-specific antigen value of 12.2 ng/mL (range, 1.2-81.6 ng/mL). The median injected activity of 18F-rhPSMA-7 was 327 MBq (range, 132-410 MBq), with a median uptake time of 79.5 min (range, 60-153 min). All patients underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection. The presence of lymph node metastases was determined by an experienced reader independently for both the PET and the morphologic datasets using a template-based analysis on a 5-point scale. Patient-level and template-based results were both compared with histopathologic findings. Results: Lymph node metastases were present in 18 patients (31.0%) and were located in 52 of 375 templates (13.9%). Receiver-operating-characteristic analyses showed 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET to perform significantly better than morphologic imaging on both patient-based and template-based analyses (areas under curve, 0.858 vs. 0.649 [P = 0.012] and 0.765 vs. 0.589 [P < 0.001], respectively). On patient-based analyses, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET were 72.2%, 92.5%, and 86.2%, respectively, and those of morphologic imaging were 50.0%, 72.5%, and 65.5%, respectively. On template-based analyses, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET were 53.8%, 96.9%, and 90.9%, respectively, and those of morphologic imaging were 9.6%, 95.0%, and 83.2%, respectively. Conclusion:18F-rhPSMA-7 PET is superior to morphologic imaging for N-staging of high-risk primary PC. The efficacy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 is similar to published data for 68Ga-PSMA-11.",

On the basis of clinical results, 18F-PSMA-1007 is a promising PSMA PET tracer, but detailed histologic confirmation has been lacking. Methods: Ninety-six patients with prostate cancer underwent 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT followed by either radical prostatectomy with lymphadenectomy or salvage lymphadenectomy. The histologic findings of PSMA PET-positive nodes were analyzed retrospectively. A lesion-based and patient-based analysis was performed comparing all positive lesions and only lesions larger than 3 mm on histopathology. Results: Of the patients, 90.6% received 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT for staging before the primary treatment, whereas 9.4% underwent imaging for biochemical recurrence. In 34.4% of the cohort, positive lymph nodes were present on imaging. In total, 1,746 lymph nodes were dissected in 96 patients. 18F-PSMA-1007 PET had a lesion-based sensitivity of 81.7%, a specificity of 99.6%, a positive predictive value of 92.4%, and a negative predictive value of 98.9% for detecting positive lymph nodes larger than 3 mm. In the analysis of all malignant nodes regardless of size, the overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value on lesion-based analysis were 71.2%, 99.5%, 91.3%, and 97.9%, respectively. The patient-based analysis showed a sensitivity of 85.9% and a specificity of 99.5% for lymph nodes larger than 3 mm.

        "# Title: Standard assessments of frailty are validated predictors of mortality in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis.\n# Abstract: The risk of morbidity and mortality for hospitalized patients with cirrhosis is high and incompletely captured by conventional indices. We sought to evaluate the predictive role of frailty in an observational cohort study of inpatients with decompensated cirrhosis between 2010 and 2013. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included discharge to a rehabilitation hospital, 30-day readmission, and length of stay. Frailty was assessed with three metrics: activities of daily living (ADL), the Braden Scale, and the Morse fall risk score. A predictive model was validated by randomly dividing the population into training and validation cohorts: 734 patients were admitted 1358 times in the study period. The overall 90-day mortality was 18.3%. The 30-day readmission rate was 26.6%, and the rate of discharge to a rehabilitation facility was 14.3%. Adjusting for sex, age, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, sodium, and Charlson index, the odds ratio for the effect of an ADL score of less than 12 of 15 on mortality is 1.83 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-3.20). A predictive model for 90-day mortality including ADL and Braden Scale yielded C statistics of 0.83 (95% CI 0.80-0.86) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.71-0.83) in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Discharge to a rehabilitation hospital is predicted by both the ADL (<12) and Braden Scale (<16), with respective adjusted odds ratios of 3.78 (95% CI 1.97-7.29) and 6.23 (95% CI 2.53-15.4).

However, for patients with compensated disease, data are limited regarding associations with poor patient-reported outcomes (PROs). We prospectively enrolled 300 patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension without a history of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and reviewed medical and pharmacy records. We characterized determinants of PROs using the 8-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-8) scale (0-100) and sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; poor sleep >5). Disability and frailty measures were assessed using activities of daily living (ADLs), falls, hand-grip, and chair-stands. Cognitive function was measured using weighted-lures from the Inhibitory Control Test (ICT). The median age of our cohort was 60 (interquartile range [IQR], 52-66) years, 56.3% were male, and 70% Child class A. All patients had portal hypertension, 76% had varices, and 41% had a history of ascites (predominantly well controlled). The median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease with Sodium (MELD-Na) score was 9 (IQR, 7-13). The overall median SF-8 was 70 (IQR, 54-86). Multivariate analysis showed that after adjusting for age, sex, education, and MELD-Na, performance on chair-stands (9.28 HRQOL points [95% confidence interval {CI}, 4.76-13.8] per 10-stands), ADL dependence (-6.06 [-10.8 to -1.36]), opiate use (-5.01 [-7.84 to -2.19]), benzodiazepine use (-3.50 [-6.58 to -0.42]), and ICT performance (-0.10 [-0.20 to 0.001] per weighted-lure) were significantly associated with HRQOL. Among patients completing the ICT, poor HRQOL (score <50) was significantly associated with chair-stands (odds ratio [OR] per 10-stands, 0.24; 95% CI [0.11-0.56]) and weighted lures (OR per weighted-lure, 1.01 [1.00-1.03]). Poor sleep quality was associated with opiate use (OR, 2.85 [1.11-7.29]) and lures (OR per-lure, 1.03 [1.00-1.05]).

        "# Title: Frailty Is a Risk Factor for Postoperative Mortality in Patients With Cirrhosis Undergoing Diverse Major Surgeries.\n# Abstract: With a rising burden of cirrhosis surgeries, understanding risk factors for postoperative mortality is more salient than ever. The role of baseline frailty has not been assessed in this context. We evaluated the association between patient frailty and postoperative risk among diverse patients with cirrhosis and determined if frailty improves prognostication of cirrhosis surgical risk scores. This was a retrospective cohort study of U.S. veterans with cirrhosis identified between 2008 and 2016 who underwent nontransplant major surgery. Frailty was ascertained using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS). Cox regression analysis was used to investigate the impact of patient frailty on postoperative mortality. Logistic regression was used to identify incremental changes in discrimination for postoperative mortality when frailty was added to the risk prediction models, including the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), MELD-sodium (MELD-Na), Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP), Mayo Risk Score (MRS), and Veterans Outcomes and Costs Associated With Liver Disease (VOCAL)-Penn. A total of 804 cirrhosis surgeries were identified. The majority of patients (48.5%) had high-risk frailty at baseline (HFRS >15). In adjusted Cox regression models, categories of increasing frailty scores were associated with poorer postoperative survival. For example, intermediate-risk frailty (HFRS 5-15) conferred a 1.77-fold increased hazard relative to low-risk frailty (HFRS, <5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-2.95; P = 0.03). High-risk frailty demonstrated a similarly increased hazard (hazard ratio, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.05-2.88; P = 0.03), suggesting a threshold effect of frailty on postoperative mortality. The incorporation of frailty improved discrimination of MELD, MELD-Na, and CTP for postoperative mortality, but did not do so for the MRS or VOCAL-Penn score. Patient frailty was an additional important predictor of cirrhosis surgical risk. The incorporation of preoperative frailty assessments may help to risk stratify patients, especially in settings where the MELD-Na and CTP are commonly applied.",

We examined the feasibility of inpatient frailty measurements and associations with nonhome discharge, readmission, and all-cause mortality among patients admitted for cirrhosis complications. We conducted a prospective study at 3 liver transplantation (LT) centers. Frailty was assessed using the liver frailty index (LFI). Multivariable logistic and competing risk models evaluated associations between frailty and clinical outcomes. We included 211 patients with median MELD-Na score 21 (interquartile range [IQR],15-27); 96 (45%) were women, and 102 (48%) were on the LT waiting list. At a median follow-up of 8.3 months, 29 patients (14%) were nonhome discharged, 144 (68%) were readmitted, 70 (33%) underwent LT, and 44 (21%) died. A total of 124 patients (59%) were frail, with a median LFI of 4.71 (IQR, 4.07-5.54). Frail patients were older (mean, 59 versus 54 years) and more likely to have chronic kidney disease (40% versus 20%; P = 0.002) and coronary artery disease (17% versus 7%; P = 0.03). Frailty was associated with hospital-acquired infections (8% versus 1%; P = 0.02). In multivariable models, LFI was associated with nonhome discharge (odds ratio, 1.81 per 1-point increase; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-2.86). Frailty (LFI≥4.5) was associated with all-cause mortality in models accounting for LT as competing risk (subhazard ratio [sHR], 2.4; 95% CI, 1.13-5.11); results were similar with LFI as a continuous variable (sHR, 1.62 per 1-point increase; 95% CI, 1.15-2.28). A brief, objective inpatient frailty assessment was feasible and predicted nonhome discharge and mortality in decompensated cirrhosis.

Studies simultaneously incorporating disease severity based on biochemical parameters and other physical/psychological effects (i.e., sleep disturbance and frailty) are heterogeneous and the subject of the present study. We analyzed and compared HRQoL, using the EuroQol Group 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire and the utility index retrieved, in patients with cirrhosis and across groups stratified by sleep disturbance or frailty phenotype. Sleep disturbance and frailty were determined by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Frailty Index, respectively. Multiple linear regression was implemented to clarify contributors of poor HRQoL. In this cohort of 227 patients with mean age of 61.7 years and 47.2% male, more than half of the study population represented impairment in HRQoL in at least one domain, according to EQ-5D. Furthermore, sleep disturbance and frailty have proved to be independently associated with poor HRQoL in two separate regression models, whereas conventional scoring systems such as Child-Pugh classification and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease are not closely relevant. Intriguingly, not all health domains within EQ-5D correlated well with PSQI and Frailty Index, with the exception of usual activities. Pain and anxiety/depression were the most frequently affected HRQoL domains even in patients without sleep disturbance or frailty. Conclusion: Impaired HRQoL is prevalent in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Sleep disturbance and frailty are independently associated with poor HRQoL. It is imperative to timely intervene with these symptoms and deliver tailored health care.",

        "# Title: Liver Frailty Index for Prediction of Short-Term Rehospitalization in Patients with Liver Cirrhosis.\n# Abstract: Background: Stratifying patients with liver cirrhosis for risk of rehospitalization is challenging with established scoring systems for chronic liver disease. Frailty captures the physical characteristics of patients with cirrhosis. Its value for predicting short-term rehospitalizations in hospitalized patients remains to be defined. Methods: Eighty-three non-electively hospitalized patients with liver cirrhosis were analyzed in this study. Frailty was assessed during the last 48 h of hospital stay with the liver frailty index (LFI). Patients were followed for 30-day rehospitalization. Results: In total, 26 (31%) patients were rehospitalized within 30 days. The median LFI was 4.5, and 43 (52%) patients were identified as frail. Rehospitalized patients had a significant higher LFI compared to patients without a rehospitalization within 30 days. In multivariable analysis, LFI as a metric variable (OR 2.36, p = 0.02) and lower platelet count (OR 0.98, p < 0.01) were independently associated with rehospitalization. LFI and its subtest chair stands had the best discriminative ability to predict rehospitalization, with AUROCs of 0.66 and 0.67, respectively. An LFI cut-off of >4.62 discriminated best between patients with and without elevated risk for rehospitalization within 30 days. Conclusions: Measures of frailty could be useful to identify patients at higher risk for short-term rehospitalization.",

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a cross-sectional study involving individuals aged 32 to 69 years, all diagnosed with liver cirrhosis. The chronic liver disease questionnaire (CLDQ) was used to assess HR-QoL, the CLDQ score was used as an outcome to measure the factors related to HR-QoL, and the liver frailty index (LFI) was used to assess the frailty status. The association between the frailty status and the CLDQ summary scales was investigated using the correlation coefficient and multiple regression analyses. A total of 138 patients in the frail (n = 62) and non-frail (n = 76) groups with (alcohol: 97; viral: 24; autoimmune: 17; and cryptogenic: 12) were included in the study. Age, CTP score, and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) sodium were significantly higher in the frail group. In the CLDQ domains, there was a significant difference between the frail and non-frail groups (p value = 0.001). In health-related quality-of-life summary measures, there was a strong negative correlation between frailty and the scores for activities, emotional function, and fatigue (p value = 0.001). When comparing frail to non-frail patients, these characteristics demonstrated significantly increased odds as indicated by their adjusted odds ratios: OR 3.339 (p value = 0.013), OR 3.998 (p value = 0.006), and OR 4.626 (p value = 0.002), respectively."

These measures often improve risk prediction beyond conventional scores like MELD and CTP, and are associated with increased risk of complications, decompensation, and poorer health-related quality of life, especially in patients with decompensated disease or awaiting transplantation.",

The current study analyzed the clinical significance of this new stage in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Subjects and Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 4045 eligible PTC patients. The patients were divided into four groups according to the extent of ETE: no ETE, ETE into perithyroidal tissue, T3b (ETE into the strap muscles), and ETE beyond the strap muscles. Differences in the clinical characteristics and prognosis of the four groups were assessed. Results: Of these 4045 patients, 2300 (56.9%) had no ETE, 1004 (24.8%) had ETE into perithyroidal tissue, 371 (9.2%) had ETE into the strap muscles, and 370 (9.1%) had ETE beyond the strap muscles. Tumor size, multifocality, lymph node metastasis (LNM), distant metastasis (DM), recurrence, and recurrence-free survival (RFS) between patients with ETE into perithyroidal tissue and patients without ETE did not show differences, but significant differences were observed between patients with T3b and patients without ETE, and only patients with ETE beyond the strap muscles had significantly worse overall survival (OS) than the other three groups. However, T3b did not independently predict worse RFS in univariable and multivariable analyses. Conclusions: T3b, distinguished from minimal ETE, may be related to larger tumor size, higher prevalence of multifocality, LNM, DM, recurrence, and worse RFS than no ETE, but it may not affect OS and may not independently predict recurrence in PTC patients.",
        "# Title: Is There a Difference Between Minimal and Gross Extension into the Strap Muscles for the Risk of Recurrence in Papillary Thyroid Carcinomas?\n# Abstract: Background: The morbidity of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is primarily related to locoregional recurrences and distant metastases. The definition of minimal extrathyroidal extension (mETE) has been recently revised. The presence of mETE does not impact mortality and is generally not considered to be a predictor for the risk of recurrence. This study aimed at comparing the risk of recurrence and the response to therapy of PTC with mETE and gross extrathyroidal extension (ETE) into the strap muscles (gETE) with low- and intermediate-risk PTC without ETE (low risk w/o ETE and intermediate risk w/o ETE, respectively) to further characterize the impact of ETE on outcomes. Methods: A total of 596 PTCs were analyzed according to the degree of ETE as well as other predictors of recurrence. Four groups of patients were compared, low risk w/o ETE (n = 251), intermediate risk w/o ETE (n = 89), mETE (n = 191), and gETE (n = 65), to determine the risk of recurrence and the response to treatment. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate associations between groups and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: The risk of recurrence was 3% in low risk w/o ETE PTC, 14% in intermediate risk w/o ETE, 14% in mETE, and 25% in gETE. The recurrence risk was increased by the presence of ETE (odds ratio [OR] = 2.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-5.85, p = 0.005) and lymph node metastases (OR = 2.44 [95% CI 1.25-4.76], p = 0.009). Patients with low-risk carcinomas w/o ETE experienced longer DFS than those with mETE (hazard ratio = 0.08 [95% CI 0.02-0.28], p < 0.001), but no significant difference was observed between intermediate risk w/o ETE, mETE, and gETE. In terms of the response to therapy, patients with gETE had higher rates of biochemical and/or structural incomplete responses within the first year of treatment (OR = 2.68 [95% CI 1.31-5.45], p = 0.007) and at the final follow-up evaluation (OR = 4.35 [95% CI 1.99-9.51], p < 0.001) compared with those with mETE. An analysis of the subgroups of microcarcinomas without lymph node metastases revealed no significant difference in DFS or the response to therapy between the low risk w/o ETE and mETE PTC groups. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that both mETE and gETE are independent risk factors for the risk of recurrence in PTC. Although gETE has a more pronounced impact on the recurrence risk and is associated with a worse response to therapy, mETE may not be associated with a low risk of recurrence. This observation suggests that patients with PTC and mETE may, in part, have an intermediate risk of recurrence and need to be followed accordingly."

      "referenceConclusion": "The complete explanation of the genomic background behind melanoma pathogenesis remains elusive. This study presents a summary of current understanding regarding the clonal relatedness of mutated genes in primary cutaneous melanoma and matched tumors. We draw attention to the knowledge gap regarding the genetic heterogeneity of melanoma-specific genes, which could serve as a valuable tool in identifying suitable patients for trials testing possible new targeted therapies. Furthermore, we found that CM presents a significant concordance in BRAF status between primary and metastatic tumors than in previous meta-analyses, probably due to technical advances, although a minority of patients showed inconsistencies. Therefore, we propose that molecular testing in metastatic tissue is a more appropriate method for determining BRAF status to tailor the treatment decision, although it is still reasonable to use the primary tumor in cases of difficulty. Further research should investigate the factors causing these discrepancies and the feasibility of using other molecular markers with BRAF status to better stratify patients for melanoma treatment.",

With the emergence of BRAF(V600E) as a therapeutic target, we investigated intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity in melanoma using detection of the BRAF(V600E) mutation as a marker of clonality. BRAF mutant-specific PCR (MS-PCR) and conventional sequencing were performed on 112 tumors from 73 patients, including patients with matched primary and metastatic specimens (n = 18). Nineteen patients had tissues available from multiple metastatic sites. Mutations were detected in 36/112 (32%) melanomas using conventional sequencing, and 85/112 (76%) using MS-PCR. The better sensitivity of the MS-PCR to detect the mutant BRAF(V600E) allele was not due to the presence of contaminating normal tissue, suggesting that the tumor was comprised of subclones of differing BRAF genotypes. To determine if tumor subclones were present in individual primary melanomas, we performed laser microdissection and mutation detection via sequencing and BRAF(V600E)-specific SNaPshot analysis in 9 cases. Six of these cases demonstrated differing proportions of BRAF(V600E)and BRAF(wild-type) cells in distinct microdissected regions within individual tumors. Additional analyses of multiple metastatic samples from individual patients using the highly sensitive MS-PCR without microdissection revealed that 5/19 (26%) patients had metastases that were discordant for the BRAF(V600E) mutation. In conclusion, we used highly sensitive BRAF mutation detection methods and observed substantial evidence for heterogeneity of the BRAF(V600E) mutation within individual melanoma tumor specimens, and among multiple specimens from individual patients. Given the varied clinical responses of patients to BRAF inhibitor therapy, these data suggest that additional studies to determine possible associations between clinical outcomes and intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity could prove fruitful.",

Patients with BRAF mutation-negative primary tumors may manifest BRAF mutation-positive metastatic disease. It is unclear whether all metastatic lesions carry the same BRAF mutation status found in the primary tumor and if discordancy exists, in what frequency it occurs. Primary and matched metastatic lesions in 25 melanoma patients were tested for the BRAF V600E/Ec, V600K, V600D, and V600R mutations using a BRAF RGQ PCR kit (Qiagen). Four patients (16%) had discrepancies between their primary and metastatic melanoma BRAF status. Of these patients, 2 (8%) had BRAF mutation-positive primary melanomas with BRAF mutation-negative metastatic lesions and 2 (8%) patient had BRAF mutation-negative melanoma with a BRAF mutation-positive metastatic lesion. In summary, discordancy of BRAF mutation status is not an infrequent finding between primary and metastatic melanoma. It may be prudent in previously negative patients to determine BRAF mutation status of new metastatic tumors for proper allocation of BRAF inhibitor therapy. Discordant BRAF status may have a role in the varying patterns of response and inevitable resistance seen with BRAF inhibitor therapies.",

Nevertheless, BRAF oncogene mutation status between different samples from the same patient has been studied with conflicting results. This study investigated the intrapatient homogeneity of BRAF mutation status using pyrosequencing in primary tumors and different metastatic sites of melanoma patients. Paired samples of lymphatic, visceral, and subcutaneous metastases and primary melanoma from 45 metastatic melanoma patients were tested for BRAF mutations using a pyrosequencing assay and by Sanger sequencing. Overall, sequencing for BRAF mutation status was performed in 114 paired samples from 45 patients. Eighteen patients (40%) carried a BRAF mutation, including BRAF V600E (12/18), BRAF V600K (5/18), and BRAF V600R (1/18) mutations. Multiple BRAF mutations (V600E and V600K) were found in one patient. Among the patients with BRAF mutations, a good agreement in BRAF mutation status was found between the first and second tumor samples genotyped (91%; Cohen's κ coefficient: 0.81). Discordance in BRAF mutation status was found only in four patients, involving all three patients in whom sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases were sampled. These SLNs exhibited a wild-type genotype and were discordant with the other BRAF-mutated samples found in the same patient. The intrapatient BRAF status was predominantly homogeneous. However, SLN genotyping using pyrosequencing might be inaccurate in determining the actual mutation status of melanoma. Further studies are required to confirm the lack of reliability of SLN.",

Although the BRAFV600E mutation appears to have a critical role in tumor initiation, its expression during tumor progression remains controversial. In fact, various authors claim that BRAFV600E heterogeneity is evident in melanoma tumors.

BRAF mutation frequency ranges from 40 to 60% depending on melanoma clinical characteristics and detection technique used.Intertumoral heterogeneity could lead to misinterpretation of BRAF mutational status; this is especially important if testing is performed on primary specimens, when metastatic lesions are unavailable.Aim of this study was to identify the best combination of methods for detecting BRAF mutations (among peptide nucleic acid - PNA-clamping real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and capillary sequencing) and investigate BRAF mutation heterogeneity in a series of 100 primary melanomas and a subset of 25 matched metastatic samples.Overall, we obtained a BRAF mutation frequency of 62%, based on the combination of at least two techniques. Concordance between mutation status in primary and metastatic tumor was good but not complete (67%), when agreement of at least two techniques were considered. Next generation sequencing was used to quantify the threshold of detected mutant alleles in discordant samples. Combining different methods excludes that the observed heterogeneity is technique-based. We propose an algorithm for BRAF mutation testing based on agreement between immunohistochemistry and PNA; a third molecular method could be added in case of discordance of the results. Testing the primary tumor when the metastatic sample is unavailable is a good option if at least two methods of detection are used, however the presence of intertumoral heterogeneity or the occurrence of additional primaries should be carefully considered.",

Given this, the objective of the current study was to ascertain concordance of somatic mutations in BRAF/NRAS/TERT and immunohistochemical PD-L1 and CD8 in matched primary cutaneous and metastatic melanoma. A total of 43 archival paired samples with sufficient material for genetic and immunohistochemical analyses met the criteria for inclusion in the study. Immunohistochemistry was performed for PD-L1 and CD8 and direct-DNA Sanger sequencing for BRAF/NRAS/TERT promoter mutational analyses. Agreement between paired samples was assessed using Cohen κ. Poor concordance among primary and corresponding metastases was noted in BRAF (9/42 cases discordant, κ = 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.77; P = .0013), TERT promoter mutations (13/41 cases discordant, κ = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.04-0.62; P = .033), tumoral PD-L1 immunoexpression (9/43 cases discordant, κ = 0.39; 95% CI, 0.07-0.72; P = .0099), and immunoexpression of CD8+ T lymphocytes (12/43 cases discordant, κ = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.19-0.69; P = .002). Although NRAS1 and NRAS2 were highly concordant (42/43 and 39/43 cases, respectively), discordant NRAS2 mutational status was associated with a median time to metastasis of 90 versus 455 days for pairs with concordant status (P = .07). Although limited by sample size, our findings suggest that consideration be given to mutational analysis of metastatic tissue rather than the primary to guide BRAF-targeted therapy and question the roles of TERT promoter mutations and PD-L1 as predictive biomarkers in malignant melanoma.",

        "# Title: Immunohistochemical and Molecular Features of Melanomas Exhibiting Intratumor and Intertumor Histomorphologic Heterogeneity.\n# Abstract: Melanoma is a heterogeneous neoplasm at the histomorphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular levels. Melanoma with extreme histomorphologic heterogeneity can pose a diagnostic challenge in which the diagnosis may predominantly rely on its immunophenotypic profile. However, tumor survival and response to therapy are linked to tumor genetic heterogeneity rather than tumor morphology. Therefore, understating the molecular characteristics of such melanomas become indispensable. In this study, DNA was extracted from 11 morphologically distinct regions in eight formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded melanomas. In each region, mutations in 50 cancer-related genes were tested using next-generation sequencing (NGS). A tumor was considered genetically heterogeneous if at least one non-overlapping mutation was identified either between the histologically distinct regions of the same tumor (intratumor heterogeneity) or among the histologically distinct regions of the paired primary and metastatic tumors within the same patient (intertumor heterogeneity). Our results revealed that genetic heterogeneity existed in all tumors as non-overlapping mutations were detected in every tested tumor (n = 5, 100%; intratumor: n = 2, 40%; intertumor: n = 3, 60%). Conversely, overlapping mutations were also detected in all the tested regions (n = 11, 100%). Melanomas exhibiting histomorphologic heterogeneity are often associated with genetic heterogeneity, which might contribute to tumor survival and poor response to therapy.",

This study evaluated the intra-patient heterogeneity of BRAF, NRAS and c-KIT mutational status between 30 primary melanomas and 39 related metastases, using molecular analysis and immunohistochemistry. BRAF mutations were identified in 46.7% of primary melanomas and 48.7% of metastases and NRAS mutations in 20% and 25.6%, respectively. Intra-patient heterogeneity was detected in 13.3% of patients for both BRAF and NRAS genes and was not associated with clinico-pathological characteristics of melanomas or metastases. High consistency was observed between immunostaining and molecular methods for BRAFV600E (k = 0.90; p < 0.001) and NRASQ61R (k = 0.87; p < 0.001). These findings demonstrate a relevant intra-patient heterogeneity between primary and metastatic lesions that is independent of clinical variables and methodological approach.",
        "# Title: Intra- and Inter-Tumor BRAF Heterogeneity in Acral Melanoma: An Immunohistochemical Analysis.\n# Abstract: The current development of BRAF inhibitors has revolutionized the treatment of unresectable melanoma. As the potential heterogeneity of BRAF mutations in melanoma has been reported, accurate detection of BRAF mutations are important. However, the genetic heterogeneity of acral melanoma-a distinct type of melanoma with a unique genetic background-has not fully been investigated. We conducted a retrospective review of our acral melanoma patients. Of the 196 patients with acral melanoma, we retrieved 31 pairs of primary and matched metastatic melanomas. We immunostained the 31 pairs with VE1, a BRAFV600E-mutation-specific monoclonal antibody. Immunohistochemistry with VE1 showed a high degree of sensitivity and specificity for detecting BRAFV600E mutations compared with the real-time polymerase chain reaction method. A total of nine primary (29.0%) and eight metastatic (25.8%) acral melanomas were positive for VE1. In three patients (9.7%), we observed a discordance of VE1 staining between the primary and metastatic lesions. Of note, VE1 immunohistochemical staining revealed a remarkable degree of intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity in acral melanoma. Our study reveals that VE1 immunostaining is a useful ancillary method for detecting BRAFV600E mutations in acral melanoma and allows for a clear visualization of intra- and inter-tumor BRAF heterogeneity.",
        "# Title: TERT, BRAF, and NRAS Mutational Heterogeneity between Paired Primary and Metastatic Melanoma Tumors.\n# Abstract: Mutational heterogeneity can contribute to therapeutic resistance in solid cancers. In melanoma, the frequencies of intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity are controversial. We examined mutational heterogeneity within individual patients with melanoma using multiplatform analysis of commonly mutated driver and nonpassenger genes. We analyzed paired primary and metastatic tumors from 60 patients and multiple metastatic tumors from 39 patients whose primary tumors were unavailable (n = 271 tumors). We used a combination of multiplex SNaPshot assays, Sanger sequencing, mutation-specific PCR, or droplet digital PCR to determine the presence of BRAFV600, NRASQ61, TERT-124C>T, and TERT-146C>T mutations. Mutations were detected in BRAF (39%), NRAS (21%), and/or TERT (78%). Thirteen patients had TERTmutant discordant tumors; seven of these had a single tumor with both TERT-124C>T and TERT-146C>T mutations present at different allele frequencies. Two patients had both BRAF and NRAS mutations; one had different tumors and the other had a single tumor with both mutations. One patient with a BRAFmutant primary lacked mutant BRAF in at least one of their metastases. Overall, we identified mutational heterogeneity in 18 of 99 patients (18%). These results suggest that some primary melanomas may be composed of subclones with differing mutational profiles. Such heterogeneity may be relevant to treatment responses and survival outcomes."

        "conclusionA": "Genetic concordance between primary cutaneous melanoma and its metastases is a complex phenomenon significantly impacting treatment response: **while initial concordance, particularly in tumor mutational burden (TMB), correlates with improved outcomes for both targeted BRAF/MEK inhibition and immunotherapy, discordance – often driven by the emergence of resistance mutations or loss of heterozygosity – frequently predicts diminished treatment efficacy and can be dynamically monitored using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to inform adaptive therapeutic strategies.**",
        "conclusionB": "Despite generally high concordance, significant discordance in BRAF mutation status—occurring in 8% to 40% of patients depending on the study and methodology—is observed between primary melanomas and their metastases, highlighting the potential for inaccurate treatment allocation and the need to re-evaluate mutation status in metastatic disease, particularly when initial testing was negative or when response to BRAF inhibitor therapy is suboptimal."

Patients were assessed by interview, full rheumatological and neurological examination, 14 days post stroke, for a history of shoulder pain according to predetermined criteria. In addition, Barthel Index, HAD score and pain scores were also recorded. Twenty-five percent of patients developed shoulder pain within 2 weeks of their stroke. There was a statistically significant association with ipsilateral sensory impairment (p < 0.005), abnormal rheumatological examination (p < 0.001) and depression score (p < 0.005).

Sequence-influenced methylations were described in T2DM-associated genomic regions, but evidence for direct, sequence-independent association with disease risk is missing. Here, we explore disease-contributing DNA methylation through a stepwise study design: first, a pool-based, genome-scale screen among 1169 case and control individuals revealed an excess of differentially methylated sites in genomic regions that were previously associated with T2DM through genetic studies. Next, in-depth analyses were performed at selected top-ranking regions. A CpG site in the first intron of the FTO gene showed small (3.35%) but significant (P = 0.000021) hypomethylation of cases relative to controls. The effect was independent of the sequence polymorphism in the region and persists among individuals carrying the sequence-risk alleles. The odds of belonging to the T2DM group increased by 6.1% for every 1% decrease in methylation (OR = 1.061, 95% CI: 1.032-1.090), the odds ratio for decrease of 1 standard deviation of methylation (adjusted to gender) was 1.5856 (95% CI: 1.2824-1.9606) and the sensitivity (area under the curve = 0.638, 95% CI: 0.586-0.690; males = 0.675, females = 0.609) was better than that of the strongest known sequence variant. Furthermore, a prospective study in an independent population cohort revealed significant hypomethylation of young individuals that later progressed to T2DM, relative to the individuals who stayed healthy. Further genomic analysis revealed co-localization with gene enhancers and with binding sites for methylation-sensitive transcriptional regulators. The data showed that low methylation level at the analyzed sites is an early marker of T2DM and suggests a novel mechanism by which early-onset, inter-individual methylation variation at isolated non-promoter genomic sites predisposes to T2DM.",
        "# Title: DNA methylation profiling identifies epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetic patients.\n# Abstract: In addition to genetic predisposition, environmental and lifestyle factors contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Epigenetic changes may provide the link for translating environmental exposures into pathological mechanisms. In this study, we performed the first comprehensive DNA methylation profiling in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We uncovered 276 CpG loci affiliated to promoters of 254 genes displaying significant differential DNA methylation in diabetic islets. These methylation changes were not present in blood cells from T2D individuals nor were they experimentally induced in non-diabetic islets by exposure to high glucose. For a subgroup of the differentially methylated genes, concordant transcriptional changes were present. Functional annotation of the aberrantly methylated genes and RNAi experiments highlighted pathways implicated in β-cell survival and function; some are implicated in cellular dysfunction while others facilitate adaptation to stressors. Together, our findings offer new insights into the intricate mechanisms of T2D pathogenesis, underscore the important involvement of epigenetic dysregulation in diabetic islets and may advance our understanding of T2D aetiology.",

Epigenetics may affect disease susceptibility. To describe the human methylome in pancreatic islets and determine the epigenetic basis of T2D, we analyzed DNA methylation of 479,927 CpG sites and the transcriptome in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We provide a detailed map of the global DNA methylation pattern in human islets, β- and α-cells. Genomic regions close to the transcription start site showed low degrees of methylation and regions further away from the transcription start site such as the gene body, 3'UTR and intergenic regions showed a higher degree of methylation. While CpG islands were hypomethylated, the surrounding 2 kb shores showed an intermediate degree of methylation, whereas regions further away (shelves and open sea) were hypermethylated in human islets, β- and α-cells. We identified 1,649 CpG sites and 853 genes, including TCF7L2, FTO and KCNQ1, with differential DNA methylation in T2D islets after correction for multiple testing. The majority of the differentially methylated CpG sites had an intermediate degree of methylation and were underrepresented in CpG islands (∼ 7%) and overrepresented in the open sea (∼ 60%). 102 of the differentially methylated genes, including CDKN1A, PDE7B, SEPT9 and EXOC3L2, were differentially expressed in T2D islets. Methylation of CDKN1A and PDE7B promoters in vitro suppressed their transcriptional activity. Functional analyses demonstrated that identified candidate genes affect pancreatic β- and α-cells as Exoc3l silencing reduced exocytosis and overexpression of Cdkn1a, Pde7b and Sept9 perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion in clonal β- and α-cells, respectively. Together, our data can serve as a reference methylome in human islets. We provide new target genes with altered DNA methylation and expression in human T2D islets that contribute to perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion. These results highlight the importance of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of T2D.",
        "# Title: Altered DNA methylation and differential expression of genes influencing metabolism and inflammation in adipose tissue from subjects with type 2 diabetes.\n# Abstract: Genetics, epigenetics, and environment may together affect the susceptibility for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our aim was to dissect molecular mechanisms underlying T2D using genome-wide expression and DNA methylation data in adipose tissue from monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D and independent case-control cohorts. In adipose tissue from diabetic twins, we found decreased expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation; carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism; and increased expression of genes involved in inflammation and glycan degradation. The most differentially expressed genes included ELOVL6, GYS2, FADS1, SPP1 (OPN), CCL18, and IL1RN. We replicated these results in adipose tissue from an independent case-control cohort. Several candidate genes for obesity and T2D (e.g., IRS1 and VEGFA) were differentially expressed in discordant twins. We found a heritable contribution to the genome-wide DNA methylation variability in twins. Differences in methylation between monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D were subsequently modest. However, 15,627 sites, representing 7,046 genes including PPARG, KCNQ1, TCF7L2, and IRS1, showed differential DNA methylation in adipose tissue from unrelated subjects with T2D compared with control subjects. A total of 1,410 of these sites also showed differential DNA methylation in the twins discordant for T2D. For the differentially methylated sites, the heritability estimate was 0.28. We also identified copy number variants (CNVs) in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D. Taken together, subjects with T2D exhibit multiple transcriptional and epigenetic changes in adipose tissue relevant to the development of the disease.",
        "# Title: An integrated epigenomic analysis for type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci in monozygotic twins.\n# Abstract: DNA methylation has a great potential for understanding the aetiology of common complex traits such as Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here we perform genome-wide methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) in whole-blood-derived DNA from 27 monozygotic twin pairs and follow up results with replication and integrated omics analyses. We identify predominately hypermethylated T2D-related differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and replicate the top signals in 42 unrelated T2D cases and 221 controls. The strongest signal is in the promoter of the MALT1 gene, involved in insulin and glycaemic pathways, and related to taurocholate levels in blood. Integrating the DNA methylome findings with T2D GWAS meta-analysis results reveals a strong enrichment for DMRs in T2D-susceptibility loci. We also detect signals specific to T2D-discordant twins in the GPR61 and PRKCB genes. These replicated T2D associations reflect both likely causal and consequential pathways of the disease. The analysis indicates how an integrated genomics and epigenomics approach, utilizing an MZ twin design, can provide pathogenic insights as well as potential drug targets and biomarkers for T2D and other complex traits.",

In the setting of large, extended families representing a minority, high-risk population of the USA, we aimed to characterize the role of epigenome-wide DNA methylation in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Using Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays, we tested for association of DNA methylation at 446 356 sites with age, sex and phenotypic traits related to T2D in 850 pedigreed Mexican-American individuals. Robust statistical analyses showed that (i) 15% of the methylome is significantly heritable, with a median heritability of 0.14; (ii) DNA methylation at 14% of CpG sites is associated with nearby sequence variants; (iii) 22% and 3% of the autosomal CpG sites are associated with age and sex, respectively; (iv) 53 CpG sites were significantly associated with liability to T2D, fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance; (v) DNA methylation levels at five CpG sites, mapping to three well-characterized genes (TXNIP, ABCG1 and SAMD12) independently explained 7.8% of the heritability of T2D (vi) methylation at these five sites was unlikely to be influenced by neighboring DNA sequence variation. Our study has identified novel epigenetic indicators of T2D risk in Mexican Americans who have increased risk for this disease. These results provide new insights into potential treatment targets of T2D.",

Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a marker for average blood glucose levels over the previous 12 weeks, is used as a measure of glycemic control and also as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes (HbA1c levels ≥ 6.5%). Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, may be associated with aging processes and with modulation of the risk of various pathologies, such as DM. Specifically, DNA methylation could be one of the mechanisms mediating the relation between DM and environmental exposures. Our goal was to identify new CpG methylation sites associated with DM. We performed a genome-wide methylation study in whole-blood DNA from an IS patient cohorts. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array was used to measure DNA methylation in CpG sites. All statistical analyses were adjusted for sex, age, hyperlipidemia, body mass index (BMI), smoking habit and cell count. Findings were replicated in two independent cohorts, an IS cohort and a population-based cohort, using the same array. In the discovery phase (N = 355), we identified a CpG site, cg19693031 (located in the TXNIP gene) that was associated with DM (P = 1.17 × 10(-12)); this CpG was replicated in two independent cohorts (N = 167 and N = 645). Methylation of TXNIP was inversely and intensely associated with HbA1c levels (P = 7.3 × 10(-16)), specifically related to diabetic patients with poor control of glucose levels. We identified an association between the TXNIP gene and DM through epigenetic mechanisms, related to sustained hyperglycemia levels (HbA1c ≥ 7%).",

Here we examine whether age-related epigenetic changes affect human islet function and if blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect these changes and associate with future T2D. We analyse DNA methylation genome-wide in islets from 87 non-diabetic donors, aged 26-74 years. Aging associates with increased DNA methylation of 241 sites. These sites cover loci previously associated with T2D, for example, KLF14. Blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related methylation changes in 83 genes identified in human islets (for example, KLF14, FHL2, ZNF518B and FAM123C) and some associate with insulin secretion and T2D. DNA methylation correlates with islet expression of multiple genes, including FHL2, ZNF518B, GNPNAT1 and HLTF. Silencing these genes in β-cells alter insulin secretion. Together, we demonstrate that blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related DNA methylation changes in human islets, and associate with insulin secretion in vivo and T2D.",

To conduct a genome-wide DNA methylation in individuals with type 2 diabetes, individuals with prediabetes, and control mixed ancestry individuals from South Africa. Methods. We used peripheral blood to perform genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in 3 individuals with screen detected diabetes, 3 individuals with prediabetes, and 3 individuals with normoglycaemia from the Bellville South Community, Cape Town, South Africa, who were age-, gender-, body mass index-, and duration of residency-matched. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) was performed by Arraystar Inc. (Rockville, MD, USA). Results. Hypermethylated DMRs were 1160 (81.97%) and 124 (43.20%), respectively, in individuals with diabetes and prediabetes when both were compared to subjects with normoglycaemia. Our data shows that genes related to the immune system, signal transduction, glucose transport, and pancreas development have altered DNA methylation in subjects with prediabetes and diabetes. Pathway analysis based on the functional analysis mapping of genes to KEGG pathways suggested that the linoleic acid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism pathways are hypomethylated in prediabetes and diabetes. Conclusions. Our study suggests that epigenetic changes are likely to be an early process that occurs before the onset of overt diabetes. Detailed analysis of DMRs that shows gradual methylation differences from control versus prediabetes to prediabetes versus diabetes in a larger sample size is required to confirm these findings.",
        "# Title: Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing of Human Pancreatic Islets Reveals Novel Differentially Methylated Regions in Type 2 Diabetes Pathogenesis.\n# Abstract: Current knowledge about the role of epigenetics in type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains limited. Only a few studies have investigated DNA methylation of selected candidate genes or a very small fraction of genomic CpG sites in human pancreatic islets, the tissue of primary pathogenic importance for diabetes. Our aim was to characterize the whole-genome DNA methylation landscape in human pancreatic islets, to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in diabetic islets, and to investigate the function of DMRs in islet biology. Here, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, which is a comprehensive and unbiased method to study DNA methylation throughout the genome at a single nucleotide resolution, in pancreatic islets from donors with T2D and control subjects without diabetes. We identified 25,820 DMRs in islets from individuals with T2D. These DMRs cover loci with known islet function, e.g., PDX1, TCF7L2, and ADCY5 Importantly, binding sites previously identified by ChIP-seq for islet-specific transcription factors, enhancer regions, and different histone marks were enriched in the T2D-associated DMRs. We also identified 457 genes, including NR4A3, PARK2, PID1, SLC2A2, and SOCS2, that had both DMRs and significant expression changes in T2D islets. To mimic the situation in T2D islets, candidate genes were overexpressed or silenced in cultured β-cells. This resulted in impaired insulin secretion, thereby connecting differential methylation to islet dysfunction. We further explored the islet methylome and found a strong link between methylation levels and histone marks. Additionally, DNA methylation in different genomic regions and of different transcript types (i.e., protein coding, noncoding, and pseudogenes) was associated with islet expression levels. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the islet DNA methylome in individuals with and without diabetes and highlights the importance of epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets and T2D pathogenesis."

Here, we present data from a retrospective analysis using PET/CT and PET/MRI examinations to investigate the efficacy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET for primary N-staging of patients with prostate cancer (PC) compared with morphologic imaging (CT or MRI) and validated by histopathology. Methods: Data from 58 patients with high-risk PC (according to the D'Amico criteria) who were staged with 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET/CT or PET/MRI at our institution between July 2017 and June 2018 were reviewed. The patients had a median prescan prostate-specific antigen value of 12.2 ng/mL (range, 1.2-81.6 ng/mL). The median injected activity of 18F-rhPSMA-7 was 327 MBq (range, 132-410 MBq), with a median uptake time of 79.5 min (range, 60-153 min). All patients underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection. The presence of lymph node metastases was determined by an experienced reader independently for both the PET and the morphologic datasets using a template-based analysis on a 5-point scale. Patient-level and template-based results were both compared with histopathologic findings. Results: Lymph node metastases were present in 18 patients (31.0%) and were located in 52 of 375 templates (13.9%). Receiver-operating-characteristic analyses showed 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET to perform significantly better than morphologic imaging on both patient-based and template-based analyses (areas under curve, 0.858 vs. 0.649 [P = 0.012] and 0.765 vs. 0.589 [P < 0.001], respectively). On patient-based analyses, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET were 72.2%, 92.5%, and 86.2%, respectively, and those of morphologic imaging were 50.0%, 72.5%, and 65.5%, respectively. On template-based analyses, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET were 53.8%, 96.9%, and 90.9%, respectively, and those of morphologic imaging were 9.6%, 95.0%, and 83.2%, respectively.

On the basis of clinical results, 18F-PSMA-1007 is a promising PSMA PET tracer, but detailed histologic confirmation has been lacking. Methods: Ninety-six patients with prostate cancer underwent 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT followed by either radical prostatectomy with lymphadenectomy or salvage lymphadenectomy. The histologic findings of PSMA PET-positive nodes were analyzed retrospectively. A lesion-based and patient-based analysis was performed comparing all positive lesions and only lesions larger than 3 mm on histopathology. Results: Of the patients, 90.6% received 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT for staging before the primary treatment, whereas 9.4% underwent imaging for biochemical recurrence. In 34.4% of the cohort, positive lymph nodes were present on imaging. In total, 1,746 lymph nodes were dissected in 96 patients. 18F-PSMA-1007 PET had a lesion-based sensitivity of 81.7%, a specificity of 99.6%, a positive predictive value of 92.4%, and a negative predictive value of 98.9% for detecting positive lymph nodes larger than 3 mm. In the analysis of all malignant nodes regardless of size, the overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value on lesion-based analysis were 71.2%, 99.5%, 91.3%, and 97.9%, respectively. The patient-based analysis showed a sensitivity of 85.9% and a specificity of 99.5% for lymph nodes larger than 3 mm.

This single-center study was conducted to assess the accuracy of SWE in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), in comparison with transient elastography (TE), by using liver biopsy (LB) as the reference standard. Consecutive patients with CHC scheduled for LB by referring physicians were studied. One hundred and twenty-one patients met inclusion criteria. On the same day, real-time SWE using the ultrasound (US) system, Aixplorer (SuperSonic Imagine S.A., Aix-en-Provence, France), TE using FibroScan (Echosens, Paris, France), and US-assisted LB were consecutively performed. Fibrosis was staged according to the METAVIR scoring system. Analyses of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were performed to calculate optimal area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for F0-F1 versus F2-F4, F0- F2 versus F3-F4, and F0-F3 versus F4 for both real-time SWE and TE. Liver stiffness values increased in parallel with degree of liver fibrosis, both with SWE and TE.

It can evaluate larger regions of interest and, therefore, might be better at determining the overall fibrosis distribution. The aim of this prospective study was to compare 2-D SWE with the two best evaluated liver elastography methods, transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse (point SWE using acoustic radiation force impulse) imaging, in the same population group. The study included 132 patients with chronic hepatopathies, in which liver stiffness was evaluated using transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging and 2-D SWE. The reference methods were liver biopsy for the assessment of liver fibrosis (n = 101) and magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography for the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis (n = 31). No significant difference in diagnostic accuracy, assessed as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), was found between the three elastography methods (2-D SWE, transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging) for the diagnosis of significant and advanced fibrosis and liver cirrhosis in the \"per protocol\" (AUROCs for fibrosis stages ≥2: 0.90, 0.95 and 0.91; for fibrosis stage [F] ≥3: 0.93, 0.95 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.92, 0.96 and 0.92) and \"intention to diagnose\" cohort (AUROCs for F ≥2: 0.87, 0.92 and 0.91; for F ≥3: 0.91, 0.93 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.88, 0.90 and 0.89).

A total of 291 NAFLD patients were prospectively enrolled from November 2011 to February 2015 at 2 French university hospitals. LSM was assessed by SSI, FibroScan (M probe), and ARFI within two weeks prior to liver biopsy. Calculations of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) were performed and compared for the staging of liver fibrosis. AUROC for SSI, FibroScan, and ARFI were 0.86, 0.82, and 0.77 for diagnoses of ≥F2; 0.89, 0.86, and 0.84 for ≥F3; and 0.88, 0.87, and 0.84 for F4, respectively. SSI had a higher accuracy than ARFI for diagnoses of significant fibrosis (≥F2) (P = 0.004). Clinical factors related to obesity such as body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2) , waist circumference ≥102 cm or increased parietal wall thickness were associated with LSM failures when using SSI or FibroScan and with unreliable results when using ARFI. In univariate analysis, FibroScan values were slightly correlated with NAFLD activity score and steatosis (R = 0.28 and 0.22, respectively), whereas SSI and ARFI were not; however, these components of NAFLD did not affect LSM results in multivariate analysis.

The purpose of this study was to perform an intra-individual comparison between 2-D shear wave elastography (2-D-SWE with a GE system) and Virtual Touch Tissue Quantification (VTTQ with a Siemens system) to assess whether these can be used interchangeably to grade fibrosis. Ninety-three patients (51 men, 42 women; mean age, 54 y) with liver disease of various etiologies (hepatitis B virus = 47, hepatitis C virus = 22; alcohol = 6, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis = 5, other = 13) were included. Using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values, liver fibrosis was classified into clinically non-significant (F0/F1) and significant (≥F2) fibrosis. Results indicated that intra-modality repeatability was excellent for both techniques (GE 2-D-SWE: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.89 [0.84-0.93]; VTTQ: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.90 [0.86-0.93]). Intra-modality classification agreement for fibrosis grading was good to excellent (GE 2-D-SWE: κ = 0.65, VTTQ: κ = 0.82). However, inter-modality agreement for fibrosis grading was only fair (κ = 0.31) using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values of fibrosis. In conclusion, although both GE 2-D-SWE and Siemens VTTQ exhibit good to excellent intra-modality repeatability, inter-modality agreement is only fair, suggesting that these should not be used interchangeably.",

However, the contributions of lncRNAs to gastric carcinoma and their functional mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that lncRNA gastric carcinoma high expressed transcript 1 (lncRNA-GHET1) was up-regulated in gastric carcinoma. The over-expression of this lncRNA correlates with tumor size, tumor invasion and poor survival. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses demonstrated that GHET1 over-expression promotes the proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of GHET1 inhibits the proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells. RNA pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that GHET1 physically associates with insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) and enhances the physical interaction between c-Myc mRNA and IGF2BP1, consequently increasing the stability of c-Myc mRNA and expression. The expression of GHET1 and c-Myc is strongly correlated in gastric carcinoma tissues. Depletion of c-Myc abolishes the effects of GHET1 on proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that GHET1 plays a pivotal role in gastric carcinoma cell proliferation via increasing c-Myc mRNA stability and expression, which suggests potential use of GHET1 for the prognosis and treatment of gastric carcinoma.",

A growing volume of literature has implicated the vital role of long noncoding RNA in the development of cancer. GHET1, a recently identified lncRNA, was initially characterized in gastric cancer. However, its role in bladder cancer remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that GHET1 was upregulated in bladder cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues and its over-expression correlates with tumor size, advanced tumor and lymph node status, and poor survival. GHET1 knockdown suppressed the proliferation and invasion of bladder cancer cells in vitro. In the meantime, inhibition of GHET1 reversed the epithelial-mesenchymal-transition in bladder cancer cell line.

Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) attract much attention of researchers, and they are demonstrated to be dysregulated in a variety of cancers, including HCC. LncRNA gastric carcinoma high expressed transcript 1 lncRNA GHET1 is found to be dysregulated in gastric cancer (GC). However, its clinical value and potential biological function in HCC remains unclear. In this study, the expression level of GHET1 was analyzed in 72 HCC tissues and matched normal tissues by using Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). GHET1 expression was significantly up-regulated in HCC tissues and the higher level of GHET1 was related to vascular invasion, cirrhosis, tumor size, edmindson grade, and poor prognosis. Moreover, knockdown of GHET1 inhibited cell proliferation of HCC, and also caused cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis in HCC cell lines. We also found that GHET1 could epigenetically repress transcription of Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) in HCC cells by recruiting PRC2 into KLF2 promoter region. Our results indicated that lncRNA GHET1, as a growth regulator, might serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and therapy target for HCC.",

In the present study, the expression patterns of GHET1 in HNC were determined and its clinical significance was assessed. The expression level of GHET1 was significantly increased in HNC tissues, compared with paired adjacent normal tissues.

However, the function and underlying mechanisms of lncRNA GHET1 in gastric cancer are not fully understood. In this study, the expression of GHET1 was investigated in gastric cancer and it was determined whether GHET1 may potentially be used as a biomarker for the disease. The gastric cancer cell lines MGC‑803 and AGS were transfected with GHET1‑directed small interfering RNA (siRNA) and the changes in phenotype and cell‑cycle‑related molecules were assessed. The downregulation of GHET1 induced G0/G1‑phase arrest in gastric cancer cells and inhibited their proliferation, migration, and invasion. DNA synthesis and the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) decreased, which was consistent with the results of the CCK‑8 assay. The levels of specific cell‑cycle regulators were determined and the expression and activities of positive cell‑cycle regulators (cyclin D, CDK4, CDK6, cyclin E, CDK2) were reduced, whereas those of a negative regulator (P21) were increased in GHET1‑knockdown cells. Taken together, the present findings show that the downregulation of GHET1 not only inhibits the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells, but also inhibits their proliferation, at least in part by upregulating P21 expression and downregulating cyclin and CDK expression to inhibit the G0/G1 to S phase transition. The present findings may provide a potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer."

The outcomes may be affected from variations in patterns of lymph node metastasis.

Loss of LKB1 promotes cancer progression and influences therapeutic responses in preclinical studies; however, specific targeted therapies for lung cancer with LKB1 inactivation are currently unavailable. Here, we have identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) signature that is associated with the loss of LKB1 function. We discovered that LINC00473 is consistently the most highly induced gene in LKB1-inactivated human primary NSCLC samples and derived cell lines. Elevated LINC00473 expression correlated with poor prognosis, and sustained LINC00473 expression was required for the growth and survival of LKB1-inactivated NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, LINC00473 was induced by LKB1 inactivation and subsequent cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)/CREB-regulated transcription coactivator (CRTC) activation. We determined that LINC00473 is a nuclear lncRNA and interacts with NONO, a component of the cAMP signaling pathway, thereby facilitating CRTC/CREB-mediated transcription. Collectively, our study demonstrates that LINC00473 expression potentially serves as a robust biomarker for tumor LKB1 functional status that can be integrated into clinical trials for patient selection and treatment evaluation, and implicates LINC00473 as a therapeutic target for LKB1-inactivated NSCLC.",
        "# Title: The long noncoding RNA LINC00473, a target of microRNA 34a, promotes tumorigenesis by inhibiting ILF2 degradation in cervical cancer.\n# Abstract: Cervical cancer is one of the most common gynecological malignancies in women worldwide. The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00473 is increased in some human cancer tissues and it plays important roles in tumorigenesis. However, neither the expression pattern nor the biological functions of LINC00473 have been elucidated in cervical cancer so far. In the present study, gain- and loss-of-function assays showed that LINC00473 promoted cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis in cervical cancer cells in vitro. Moreover, we found that LINC00473 enhanced the growth of cervical cancer cells in vivo. Mechanistic investigation showed that LINC00473 directly interacted with ILF2 and suppressed its degradation. Finally, we demonstrated that miR-34a reduced the stability of LINC00473. These findings may have important implications for developing novel therapeutic strategies for cervical cancer.",
        "# Title: Long noncoding RNA LNC473 inhibits the ubiquitination of survivin via association with USP9X and enhances cell proliferation and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.\n# Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Recent studies reported that lncRNA LINC00473 (LNC473) was involved in cancer progression. However, the clinical significance and functional role of LNC473 in HCC progression is still unknown. In the present study, we found that the LNC473 expression was markedly elevated in HCC tissues and correlated with bigger tumor size, higher BCLC stage, vascular invasion and poor prognosis. Gain- and loss-of-function assay showed that LNC473 enhanced HCC cell proliferation and invasion and induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Mechanistically, LNC473 associated with oncoprotein survivin and regulates its stability. Moreover, LNC473 could recruit deubiquitinase USP9X to inhibit the ubiquitination level of survivin and then increase survivin expression. Therefore, our results suggest that LNC473 exerts its functions as an oncogene in HCC progression and may be a therapeutic target for HCC treatment.",
        "# Title: LINC00473 predicts poor prognosis and regulates cell migration and invasion in gastric cancer.\n# Abstract: LINC00473 is an intergenic long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and has been suggested to be dysregulated in several human cancers. However, the clinical value and biological function of LINC00473 in gastric cancer (GC) was still unknown. In our results, LINC00473 expression was increased in GC tissue samples and GC cell lines compared with paired adjacent normal stomach tissue samples and normal gastric epithelial cell line, respectively. High-expression of LINC00473 was correlated with poor histological type, advanced clinical stage, more lymph node metastasis and present distant metastasis. The results of Kaplan-Meier analysis and TCGA database similarly suggested that GC patients with LINC00473 high-expression had poorer prognosis than GC patients with LINC00473 low-expression. Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that LINC00473 high-expression served as independent unfavorable prognostic factor for overall survival in GC patients. The study in vitro indicated that silencing of LINC00473 had no effect on GC cell viability, but inhibited GC cell migration and invasion through modulating MMP2 and MMP9 expression. In conclusion, LINC00473 is associated with the malignant status and prognosis in GC cases, and functions as an oncogenic lncRNA to regulate GC cell migration and invasion.",
        "# Title: Long noncoding RNA LINC00473 indicates a poor prognosis of breast cancer and accelerates tumor carcinogenesis by competing endogenous sponging miR-497.\n# Abstract: Long noncoding RNA LINC00473 (LINC00473) has been reported to be involved in the progression of several tumors. Our present study was conducted to study the potential roles and mechanism of long noncoding RNA LINC00473 (LINC00473) on cells proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of breast cancer (BC).",
        "# Title: Long noncoding RNA LINC00473 functions as a competing endogenous RNA to regulate MAPK1 expression by sponging miR-198 in breast cancer.\n# Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) is one of the primary tumors with high incidence in women. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of LINC00473 and underlying mechanisms in BC. Expression pattern of LINC00473 was analyzed using qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) assays in BC tissues and cells. Overexpression or knockdown of LINC00473 in vitro and functional experiments were performed to study its effects on BC cells. Target prediction, luciferase assays, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and RNA immunoprecipitation were used to verify the role of LINC00473 as a competing endogenous RNA. The impact of LINC00473 on tumor growth was also evaluated using a xenograft model. In our study, we found that LINC00473 was highly expressed in BC tissues and cells, and the elevated expression was correlated with shorter overall survival in patients with BC. Furthermore, knockdown of LINC00473 significantly inhibited the capacity of proliferation, invasion and migration of BC cells. Animal experiment suggested that silencing LINC00473 could significantly inhibit the tumor growth. Following experiments revealed that LINC00473 may function as a competing endogenous RNA to regulate the expression of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1 (MAPK1) through competition for miR-198. Thus, increased expression of LINC00473 in breast cancer tissues is linked to poor prognosis. LINC00473 may function as an endogenous completive RNA by sponging miR-198 to regulate MAPK1 expression. Findings of our study contributed to the basis for further exploring the application of LINC00473 as a prognostic and diagnostic biomarker.",
        "# Title: Long non‑coding RNA LINC00473/miR‑195‑5p promotes glioma progression via YAP1‑TEAD1‑Hippo signaling.\n# Abstract: There is an urgent need to identify novel potential therapeutic targets for diagnosis and treatment of glioma, a common primary tumor in brain, due to its high‑level invasiveness. Long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00473 has been reported as potentially critical regulators in various types of cancer tumorigenesis. However, the effects of LINC00473 on glioma cells is unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the clinical significance, effects and mechanism of LINC00437 on glioma tumorigenesis. In the present study, LINC00473 was significantly increased in glioma tissues and in cell models, and predicted a poor prognosis in patients with glioma. Notably, LINC00473 knockdown not only suppressed cell proliferation, invasion and migration of glioma cells, but also blocked cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis. Subcutaneous xenotransplanted tumor model experiments revealed that reduced LINC00473 expression was able to suppress in vivo glioma growth. Mechanistically, LINC00473 functioned as a competing endogenous (ce)RNA to decrease microRNA (miR)‑195‑5p expression. Moreover, Yes‑associated protein 1 (YAP1) and TEA domain family member 1 (TEAD1) were identified as downstream targets of miR‑195‑5p, whose expression levels were inhibited by miR‑195‑5p. LINC00473 knockdown suppressed glioma progression through the decrease of miR‑195‑5p and subsequent increase of YAP1 and TEAD1 expression levels. These results indicated LINC00473 might act as a ceRNA to sponge miR‑195‑5p, thus promoting YAP1 and TEAD1 expressions, and shedding light on the underlying mechanisms of LINC00473‑induced glioma progression.",
        "# Title: LINC00473 contributes to the radioresistance of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by regulating microRNA‑497‑5p and cell division cycle 25A.\n# Abstract: Long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00473 plays a carcinogenic role in a variety of different tumor types. Nevertheless, the mechanisms through which LINC00473 regulates the radiosensitivity of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells remains elusive. In the present study, reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR was used to quantify the expression of LINC00473, microRNA (miRNA/miR)‑497‑5p and cell division cycle 25A (CDC25A) in ESCC tissues. The association between LINC00473 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with ESCC was also assessed. Furthermore, Cell Counting kit‑8 and colony formation assays were carried out to monitor the proliferation of ESCC cells exposed to X‑ray radiation. A dual‑luciferase reporter assay was also conducted to analyze the interaction between LINC00473 and miR‑497‑5p, as well as the interaction between CDC25A and miR‑497‑5p. The findings of the present study demonstrated that in ESCC tissues and cells, the expression levels of LINC00473 and CDC25A were significantly upregulated, while the expression of miR‑497‑5p was downregulated. The high expression level of LINC00473 was associated with a higher T stage, lymph node metastasis stage and a lower tumor differentiation grade in patients with ESCC. Following irradiation, transfection with miR‑497‑5p mimics reduced the promoting effect of LINC00473 overexpression on ESCC cell proliferation, and partially impeded the resistance of ESCC cells to X‑ray radiation induced by LINC00473 overexpression. Moreover, transfection with miR‑497‑5p inhibitors partially alleviated the inhibitory effects of LINC00473 knockdown on cellular proliferation, and partly reversed the sensitivity of cells to X‑ray irradiation induced by LINC00473 knockdown. Furthermore, it was confirmed that miR‑497‑5p was able to bind LINC00473 and the 3'‑untranslated region of CDC25A. On the whole, the findings of the present study demonstrate that LINC00473 reduces the radiosensitivity of ESCC cells by modulating the miR‑497‑5p/CDC25A axis.",

        "# Title: LNC473 Regulating APAF1 IRES-Dependent Translation via Competitive Sponging miR574 and miR15b: Implications in Colorectal Cancer.\n# Abstract: A growing number of studies have focused on the involvement of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in the internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated translation in tumorigenesis; however, the underlying mechanisms in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain elusive. In this study, we show that LINC00473 (LNC473) exerted its functions as a tumor suppressor in promoting apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF1) IRES activity through competitively sponging miR574-5p and miR15b-5p in CRC initiation and pathogenesis. Specifically, LNC473 and its downstream target APAF1 were significantly downregulated accompanied by upregulated miR574-5p and miR15b-5p in CRC cells and tissues, which had a significant prognostic impact on clinical outcomes in our CRC cohort (n = 157). Furthermore, ectopic LNC473 significantly sponged endogenous miR574-5p or miR15b-5p and thereby inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation capacity, and it accelerated cell apoptosis through activating the APAF1-CASP9-CASP3 pathway. Notably, LNC473 overexpression resulted in dramatic promotion of APAF1 IRES activity and translation, whereas rescue experiments confirmed the recovery by the existence of LNC473 and miR574/15b-5p. Mechanistically, LNC473 overexpression promoted IRES binding domain exposure and removed the constraints controlling from miR574-5p and miR15b-5p, and subsequently enhanced IRES-mediated APAF1 expression in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, our results uncover a novel LNC473-miR574/miR15b-APAF1 signaling axis, which provides new targets and crosstalk regulation mechanism for CRC prevention and treatment.",
        "# Title: Knockdown of LINC00473 promotes radiosensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer cells via sponging miR-513a-3p.\n# Abstract: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung cancer. Radioresistance is a significant obstacle in NSCLC radiotherapy. Long non-coding RNA LINC00473 has been found to impact the radiotherapy in several malignant tumours. This study aimed to investigate the underlying role and mechanism of LINC00473 in regulating radiosensitivity of NSCLC cells. The levels of LINC00473 and miR-513a-3p were measured by quantitative Real-Time PCR. The relationship of LINC00473 with overall survival was tested by the Kaplan-Meier method. The effects of LINC00473 on cell viability and cell survival were assessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony survival assay in NSCLC cells exposed to different doses of radiation. A luciferase reporter assay was used to investigate the correlation between LINC00473 and miR-513a-3p. The present study showed that the relative LINC00473 expression was upregulated and miR-513a-3p expression was downregulated in radioresistant NSCLC patients compared with radiosensitive patients. And upregulated LINC00473 expression was associated with poor prognosis of NSCLC patients after radiotherapy. Radiation led to an increase in LINC00473 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The knockdown of LINC00473 markedly promoted radiosensitivity in NSCLC cells under different doses of radiation. LINC00473 was a sponge of miR-513a-3p and negatively regulated the miR-513a-3p expression. In conclusion, the inhibition of miR-513a-3p markedly reversed the promoted effect of LINC00473 knockdown on cell radiosensitivity. LINC00473 inhibition enhances radiosensitivity of NSCLC by sponging miR-513a-3p, providing a promising therapeutic target to increase the sensitivity of radiotherapy in NSCLC patients.",
        "# Title: lncRNA LINC00473 promotes proliferation, migration, invasion and inhibition of apoptosis of non-small cell lung cancer cells by acting as a sponge of miR-497-5p.\n# Abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-associated death worldwide and exhibits a poor prognosis. The present study aimed to determine the effect of long non-coding (lnc)RNA-LINC00473 on the development of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells by regulating the expression of microRNA (miR)-497-5p. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was conducted to detect the level of LINC00473 and miR-497-5p. An MTT assay, flow cytometry and Transwell tests were performed to evaluate the proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells. Western blotting was performed to detect the expression of apoptosis- and migration-related proteins. RNA immunoprecipitation and a luciferase reporter assay were performed to verify the regulatory relationship between lncRNA-LINC00473 and miR-497-5p. LINC00473 expression was upregulated in lung cancer tissues and NSCLC cells (A549 and H1299) when compared with adjacent tissues or human bronchial epithelial cell lines and the 5-year survival rate was lower in patients with high LINC00473 expression compared with in patients with low LINC00473 expression. A negative correlation between LINC00473 and miR-497-5p was observed in lung cancer tissues. Proliferation, migration and invasion as well as the related protein levels were increased in A549 and H1299 transfected with pcDNA3.1-LINC00473, while the opposite results were obtained in A549 and H1299 transfected with small interfering (si)-LINC00473. Notably, it was demonstrated that LINC00473 could bind directly with miR-497-5p and inhibit its expression. miR-497-5p inhibitors reversed the effect of si-LINC00473. Furthermore, the present study demonstrated that LINC00473 promoted the malignant behaviour of NSCLC cells via regulating the ERK/p38 and MAPK signalling pathways and the expression of miR-497-5p.",
        "# Title: Long intergenic non-coding RNA 00473 promotes proliferation and migration of gastric cancer via the miR-16-5p/CCND2 axis and by regulating AQP3.\n# Abstract: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, but its molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Increasing evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) play a pivotal role in various cancers recently. Our present study focused on exploring the function of long intergenic non-coding RNA 00473 (LINC00473) in GC. In this study, we found that LINC00473 expression was aberrantly increased in tumor tissues compared with the paired para-cancerous tissues. The expression of high LINC00473 in GC was notably correlated with a higher risk of lymphatic metastasis, a higher incidence of vascular cancer embolus, and advanced TNM stage. Further experiments showed that the overexpression of LINC00473 could promote the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells both in vitro and in vivo. The apoptosis of GC cells increased significantly by the decrease of LINC00473. Mechanistically, LINC00473 could sponge miR-16-5p in the cytoplasm and relieve its suppression of CCND2. Moreover, AQP3 was found to be a significant downstream target gene for LINC00473 through RNA transcriptome sequencing, as demonstrated by qRT-PCR and western blot. Overexpression of LINC00473 can partially reverse the effects of AQP3 decrease on GC proliferation and metastasis. LINC00473 regulated AQP3 expression through CREB was confirmed by western blot. Our research indicates that LINC00473/miR-16-5p/CCND2 axis plays a role in the proliferation of GC and modulates AQP3 to influence GC cell metastasis, making it a potential therapeutic target for GC."

The two most commonly used autogenous grafts are the central third of the patellar tendon and the hamstring tendon constructs. The choice of different grafts and different construct influence the final clinical outcome of ACL reconstruction. The 3 groups, of 25 patients each, were generated by choosing the technique (PT tendon, 4 strand hamstring, and single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty) to utilize and followed for 5 years, with an alternate systematic sampling. Our comparison has shown significant kneeling pain in the patellar tendon with respect to the groups with hamstrings techniques. Single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty achieved subjective score significantly higher with respect to the other two groups as well as for the time to resume sport. The study confirms that patellar tendon and hamstring can be equivalent options for ACL reconstruction. This study demonstrated that a superior outcome as far as subjective clinical findings were concerned, was obtained in group III. Patients in the latter group were also able to return to sports sooner than those in the bone-patellar tendon graft group and the four-strand hamstring group.",

The purpose of this prospective randomized study was to compare the clinical, instrumental and X-ray outcome of two ACL reconstruction techniques with hamstring tendons: one with a single intra-articular bundle associated to an extra-articular sling, the second with a more anatomic double-bundle technique that reproduces better the native ACL function. From an initial group of 100 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction, 72 patients (35 single bundle plus lateral plasty and 37 double bundle) were evaluated with IKDC, Tegner score, KT2000 arthrometer, Activity Rating Scale, Psychovitality Questionnaire and Ahlback radiographic score at a mean 3 years follow-up. Double-bundle group showed significantly better results regarding IKDC, ROM, Activity Rating Scale and time to return to sport. Also KT 2000 showed significant differences in objective stability. The double-bundle technique for ACL reconstruction described in this paper has demonstrated significantly better subjective, objective and functional results compared with a double-stranded hamstrings plus extra-articular sling at a minimum 3-year follow-up.",

We prospectively evaluated a series of 100 consecutive patients who underwent ACL reconstruction between 2001 and 2002. A clinical and radiological follow-up was performed at a minimum of 6 years. After 6 years, the International Knee Documentation Committee score demonstrated good-to-excellent results (A and B) in 98% of patients. However, arthrometric results using the KT-1000 demonstrated that 6/80 patients (7.5%) had >5 mm manual maximum side-to-side difference. The median Tegner activity score was 5 (range 1-9); the median Lysholm score was 96 (range 81-100); and the median subjective IKDC score was 94 (range 66-100). We reported 6/80 failures as revealed by a 2+ or 3+ pivot-shift test result and/or KT-1000 side-to-side difference of more than 5 mm.

Proprioception was evaluated using joint position sense and dynamic postural stability. Patient-reported outcomes were measured using the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK-11) scores. Functional performance was assessed using single-leg hop distance (SLHD) and Limb Symmetry Index. In the operated knees, quadriceps (at 6 months postoperatively, p = 0.003) and hamstring (at 6 and 12 months postoperatively, p < 0.001) strength were significantly higher in the combined ACLR and ALLR group than the isolated ACLR group.

Sequence-influenced methylations were described in T2DM-associated genomic regions, but evidence for direct, sequence-independent association with disease risk is missing. Here, we explore disease-contributing DNA methylation through a stepwise study design: first, a pool-based, genome-scale screen among 1169 case and control individuals revealed an excess of differentially methylated sites in genomic regions that were previously associated with T2DM through genetic studies. Next, in-depth analyses were performed at selected top-ranking regions. A CpG site in the first intron of the FTO gene showed small (3.35%) but significant (P = 0.000021) hypomethylation of cases relative to controls. The effect was independent of the sequence polymorphism in the region and persists among individuals carrying the sequence-risk alleles. The odds of belonging to the T2DM group increased by 6.1% for every 1% decrease in methylation (OR = 1.061, 95% CI: 1.032-1.090), the odds ratio for decrease of 1 standard deviation of methylation (adjusted to gender) was 1.5856 (95% CI: 1.2824-1.9606) and the sensitivity (area under the curve = 0.638, 95% CI: 0.586-0.690; males = 0.675, females = 0.609) was better than that of the strongest known sequence variant. Furthermore, a prospective study in an independent population cohort revealed significant hypomethylation of young individuals that later progressed to T2DM, relative to the individuals who stayed healthy. Further genomic analysis revealed co-localization with gene enhancers and with binding sites for methylation-sensitive transcriptional regulators. The data showed that low methylation level at the analyzed sites is an early marker of T2DM and suggests a novel mechanism by which early-onset, inter-individual methylation variation at isolated non-promoter genomic sites predisposes to T2DM.",

In this study, we performed the first comprehensive DNA methylation profiling in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors.

Epigenetics may affect disease susceptibility. To describe the human methylome in pancreatic islets and determine the epigenetic basis of T2D, we analyzed DNA methylation of 479,927 CpG sites and the transcriptome in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We provide a detailed map of the global DNA methylation pattern in human islets, β- and α-cells. Genomic regions close to the transcription start site showed low degrees of methylation and regions further away from the transcription start site such as the gene body, 3'UTR and intergenic regions showed a higher degree of methylation. While CpG islands were hypomethylated, the surrounding 2 kb shores showed an intermediate degree of methylation, whereas regions further away (shelves and open sea) were hypermethylated in human islets, β- and α-cells. We identified 1,649 CpG sites and 853 genes, including TCF7L2, FTO and KCNQ1, with differential DNA methylation in T2D islets after correction for multiple testing. The majority of the differentially methylated CpG sites had an intermediate degree of methylation and were underrepresented in CpG islands (∼ 7%) and overrepresented in the open sea (∼ 60%). 102 of the differentially methylated genes, including CDKN1A, PDE7B, SEPT9 and EXOC3L2, were differentially expressed in T2D islets. Methylation of CDKN1A and PDE7B promoters in vitro suppressed their transcriptional activity. Functional analyses demonstrated that identified candidate genes affect pancreatic β- and α-cells as Exoc3l silencing reduced exocytosis and overexpression of Cdkn1a, Pde7b and Sept9 perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion in clonal β- and α-cells, respectively. Together, our data can serve as a reference methylome in human islets. We provide new target genes with altered DNA methylation and expression in human T2D islets that contribute to perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion. These results highlight the importance of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of T2D.",
        "# Title: Altered DNA methylation and differential expression of genes influencing metabolism and inflammation in adipose tissue from subjects with type 2 diabetes.\n# Abstract: Genetics, epigenetics, and environment may together affect the susceptibility for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our aim was to dissect molecular mechanisms underlying T2D using genome-wide expression and DNA methylation data in adipose tissue from monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D and independent case-control cohorts. In adipose tissue from diabetic twins, we found decreased expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation; carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism; and increased expression of genes involved in inflammation and glycan degradation. The most differentially expressed genes included ELOVL6, GYS2, FADS1, SPP1 (OPN), CCL18, and IL1RN. We replicated these results in adipose tissue from an independent case-control cohort. Several candidate genes for obesity and T2D (e.g., IRS1 and VEGFA) were differentially expressed in discordant twins. We found a heritable contribution to the genome-wide DNA methylation variability in twins. Differences in methylation between monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D were subsequently modest. However, 15,627 sites, representing 7,046 genes including PPARG, KCNQ1, TCF7L2, and IRS1, showed differential DNA methylation in adipose tissue from unrelated subjects with T2D compared with control subjects. A total of 1,410 of these sites also showed differential DNA methylation in the twins discordant for T2D. For the differentially methylated sites, the heritability estimate was 0.28. We also identified copy number variants (CNVs) in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D. Taken together, subjects with T2D exhibit multiple transcriptional and epigenetic changes in adipose tissue relevant to the development of the disease.",
        "# Title: An integrated epigenomic analysis for type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci in monozygotic twins.\n# Abstract: DNA methylation has a great potential for understanding the aetiology of common complex traits such as Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here we perform genome-wide methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) in whole-blood-derived DNA from 27 monozygotic twin pairs and follow up results with replication and integrated omics analyses. We identify predominately hypermethylated T2D-related differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and replicate the top signals in 42 unrelated T2D cases and 221 controls. The strongest signal is in the promoter of the MALT1 gene, involved in insulin and glycaemic pathways, and related to taurocholate levels in blood. Integrating the DNA methylome findings with T2D GWAS meta-analysis results reveals a strong enrichment for DMRs in T2D-susceptibility loci. We also detect signals specific to T2D-discordant twins in the GPR61 and PRKCB genes. These replicated T2D associations reflect both likely causal and consequential pathways of the disease. The analysis indicates how an integrated genomics and epigenomics approach, utilizing an MZ twin design, can provide pathogenic insights as well as potential drug targets and biomarkers for T2D and other complex traits.",

In the setting of large, extended families representing a minority, high-risk population of the USA, we aimed to characterize the role of epigenome-wide DNA methylation in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Using Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays, we tested for association of DNA methylation at 446 356 sites with age, sex and phenotypic traits related to T2D in 850 pedigreed Mexican-American individuals. Robust statistical analyses showed that (i) 15% of the methylome is significantly heritable, with a median heritability of 0.14; (ii) DNA methylation at 14% of CpG sites is associated with nearby sequence variants; (iii) 22% and 3% of the autosomal CpG sites are associated with age and sex, respectively; (iv) 53 CpG sites were significantly associated with liability to T2D, fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance; (v) DNA methylation levels at five CpG sites, mapping to three well-characterized genes (TXNIP, ABCG1 and SAMD12) independently explained 7.8% of the heritability of T2D (vi) methylation at these five sites was unlikely to be influenced by neighboring DNA sequence variation. Our study has identified novel epigenetic indicators of T2D risk in Mexican Americans who have increased risk for this disease. These results provide new insights into potential treatment targets of T2D.",

        "# Title: Epigenome-wide association study identifies TXNIP gene associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and sustained hyperglycemia.\n# Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is an established risk factor for a wide range of vascular diseases, including ischemic stroke (IS). Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a marker for average blood glucose levels over the previous 12 weeks, is used as a measure of glycemic control and also as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes (HbA1c levels ≥ 6.5%). Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, may be associated with aging processes and with modulation of the risk of various pathologies, such as DM. Specifically, DNA methylation could be one of the mechanisms mediating the relation between DM and environmental exposures. Our goal was to identify new CpG methylation sites associated with DM. We performed a genome-wide methylation study in whole-blood DNA from an IS patient cohorts. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array was used to measure DNA methylation in CpG sites. All statistical analyses were adjusted for sex, age, hyperlipidemia, body mass index (BMI), smoking habit and cell count. Findings were replicated in two independent cohorts, an IS cohort and a population-based cohort, using the same array. In the discovery phase (N = 355), we identified a CpG site, cg19693031 (located in the TXNIP gene) that was associated with DM (P = 1.17 × 10(-12)); this CpG was replicated in two independent cohorts (N = 167 and N = 645). Methylation of TXNIP was inversely and intensely associated with HbA1c levels (P = 7.3 × 10(-16)), specifically related to diabetic patients with poor control of glucose levels. We identified an association between the TXNIP gene and DM through epigenetic mechanisms, related to sustained hyperglycemia levels (HbA1c ≥ 7%).",

Here we examine whether age-related epigenetic changes affect human islet function and if blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect these changes and associate with future T2D. We analyse DNA methylation genome-wide in islets from 87 non-diabetic donors, aged 26-74 years. Aging associates with increased DNA methylation of 241 sites. These sites cover loci previously associated with T2D, for example, KLF14. Blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related methylation changes in 83 genes identified in human islets (for example, KLF14, FHL2, ZNF518B and FAM123C) and some associate with insulin secretion and T2D. DNA methylation correlates with islet expression of multiple genes, including FHL2, ZNF518B, GNPNAT1 and HLTF. Silencing these genes in β-cells alter insulin secretion. Together, we demonstrate that blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related DNA methylation changes in human islets, and associate with insulin secretion in vivo and T2D.",

To conduct a genome-wide DNA methylation in individuals with type 2 diabetes, individuals with prediabetes, and control mixed ancestry individuals from South Africa. Methods. We used peripheral blood to perform genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in 3 individuals with screen detected diabetes, 3 individuals with prediabetes, and 3 individuals with normoglycaemia from the Bellville South Community, Cape Town, South Africa, who were age-, gender-, body mass index-, and duration of residency-matched. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) was performed by Arraystar Inc. (Rockville, MD, USA). Results. Hypermethylated DMRs were 1160 (81.97%) and 124 (43.20%), respectively, in individuals with diabetes and prediabetes when both were compared to subjects with normoglycaemia. Our data shows that genes related to the immune system, signal transduction, glucose transport, and pancreas development have altered DNA methylation in subjects with prediabetes and diabetes. Pathway analysis based on the functional analysis mapping of genes to KEGG pathways suggested that the linoleic acid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism pathways are hypomethylated in prediabetes and diabetes. Conclusions. Our study suggests that epigenetic changes are likely to be an early process that occurs before the onset of overt diabetes. Detailed analysis of DMRs that shows gradual methylation differences from control versus prediabetes to prediabetes versus diabetes in a larger sample size is required to confirm these findings.",
        "# Title: Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing of Human Pancreatic Islets Reveals Novel Differentially Methylated Regions in Type 2 Diabetes Pathogenesis.\n# Abstract: Current knowledge about the role of epigenetics in type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains limited. Only a few studies have investigated DNA methylation of selected candidate genes or a very small fraction of genomic CpG sites in human pancreatic islets, the tissue of primary pathogenic importance for diabetes. Our aim was to characterize the whole-genome DNA methylation landscape in human pancreatic islets, to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in diabetic islets, and to investigate the function of DMRs in islet biology. Here, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, which is a comprehensive and unbiased method to study DNA methylation throughout the genome at a single nucleotide resolution, in pancreatic islets from donors with T2D and control subjects without diabetes. We identified 25,820 DMRs in islets from individuals with T2D. These DMRs cover loci with known islet function, e.g., PDX1, TCF7L2, and ADCY5 Importantly, binding sites previously identified by ChIP-seq for islet-specific transcription factors, enhancer regions, and different histone marks were enriched in the T2D-associated DMRs. We also identified 457 genes, including NR4A3, PARK2, PID1, SLC2A2, and SOCS2, that had both DMRs and significant expression changes in T2D islets. To mimic the situation in T2D islets, candidate genes were overexpressed or silenced in cultured β-cells. This resulted in impaired insulin secretion, thereby connecting differential methylation to islet dysfunction. We further explored the islet methylome and found a strong link between methylation levels and histone marks. Additionally, DNA methylation in different genomic regions and of different transcript types (i.e., protein coding, noncoding, and pseudogenes) was associated with islet expression levels. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the islet DNA methylome in individuals with and without diabetes and highlights the importance of epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets and T2D pathogenesis."

        "# Title: Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of human pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic donors identifies candidate genes that influence insulin secretion.\n# Abstract: Impaired insulin secretion is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Epigenetics may affect disease susceptibility. To describe the human methylome in pancreatic islets and determine the epigenetic basis of T2D, we analyzed DNA methylation of 479,927 CpG sites and the transcriptome in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We provide a detailed map of the global DNA methylation pattern in human islets, β- and α-cells. Genomic regions close to the transcription start site showed low degrees of methylation and regions further away from the transcription start site such as the gene body, 3'UTR and intergenic regions showed a higher degree of methylation. While CpG islands were hypomethylated, the surrounding 2 kb shores showed an intermediate degree of methylation, whereas regions further away (shelves and open sea) were hypermethylated in human islets, β- and α-cells. We identified 1,649 CpG sites and 853 genes, including TCF7L2, FTO and KCNQ1, with differential DNA methylation in T2D islets after correction for multiple testing. The majority of the differentially methylated CpG sites had an intermediate degree of methylation and were underrepresented in CpG islands (∼ 7%) and overrepresented in the open sea (∼ 60%). 102 of the differentially methylated genes, including CDKN1A, PDE7B, SEPT9 and EXOC3L2, were differentially expressed in T2D islets. Methylation of CDKN1A and PDE7B promoters in vitro suppressed their transcriptional activity. Functional analyses demonstrated that identified candidate genes affect pancreatic β- and α-cells as Exoc3l silencing reduced exocytosis and overexpression of Cdkn1a, Pde7b and Sept9 perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion in clonal β- and α-cells, respectively. Together, our data can serve as a reference methylome in human islets. We provide new target genes with altered DNA methylation and expression in human T2D islets that contribute to perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion. These results highlight the importance of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of T2D.",
        "# Title: Altered DNA methylation and differential expression of genes influencing metabolism and inflammation in adipose tissue from subjects with type 2 diabetes.\n# Abstract: Genetics, epigenetics, and environment may together affect the susceptibility for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our aim was to dissect molecular mechanisms underlying T2D using genome-wide expression and DNA methylation data in adipose tissue from monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D and independent case-control cohorts. In adipose tissue from diabetic twins, we found decreased expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation; carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism; and increased expression of genes involved in inflammation and glycan degradation. The most differentially expressed genes included ELOVL6, GYS2, FADS1, SPP1 (OPN), CCL18, and IL1RN. We replicated these results in adipose tissue from an independent case-control cohort. Several candidate genes for obesity and T2D (e.g., IRS1 and VEGFA) were differentially expressed in discordant twins. We found a heritable contribution to the genome-wide DNA methylation variability in twins. Differences in methylation between monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D were subsequently modest. However, 15,627 sites, representing 7,046 genes including PPARG, KCNQ1, TCF7L2, and IRS1, showed differential DNA methylation in adipose tissue from unrelated subjects with T2D compared with control subjects. A total of 1,410 of these sites also showed differential DNA methylation in the twins discordant for T2D. For the differentially methylated sites, the heritability estimate was 0.28. We also identified copy number variants (CNVs) in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D. Taken together, subjects with T2D exhibit multiple transcriptional and epigenetic changes in adipose tissue relevant to the development of the disease.",
        "# Title: An integrated epigenomic analysis for type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci in monozygotic twins.\n# Abstract: DNA methylation has a great potential for understanding the aetiology of common complex traits such as Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here we perform genome-wide methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) in whole-blood-derived DNA from 27 monozygotic twin pairs and follow up results with replication and integrated omics analyses. We identify predominately hypermethylated T2D-related differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and replicate the top signals in 42 unrelated T2D cases and 221 controls. The strongest signal is in the promoter of the MALT1 gene, involved in insulin and glycaemic pathways, and related to taurocholate levels in blood. Integrating the DNA methylome findings with T2D GWAS meta-analysis results reveals a strong enrichment for DMRs in T2D-susceptibility loci. We also detect signals specific to T2D-discordant twins in the GPR61 and PRKCB genes. These replicated T2D associations reflect both likely causal and consequential pathways of the disease. The analysis indicates how an integrated genomics and epigenomics approach, utilizing an MZ twin design, can provide pathogenic insights as well as potential drug targets and biomarkers for T2D and other complex traits.",

In the setting of large, extended families representing a minority, high-risk population of the USA, we aimed to characterize the role of epigenome-wide DNA methylation in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Using Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays, we tested for association of DNA methylation at 446 356 sites with age, sex and phenotypic traits related to T2D in 850 pedigreed Mexican-American individuals. Robust statistical analyses showed that (i) 15% of the methylome is significantly heritable, with a median heritability of 0.14; (ii) DNA methylation at 14% of CpG sites is associated with nearby sequence variants; (iii) 22% and 3% of the autosomal CpG sites are associated with age and sex, respectively; (iv) 53 CpG sites were significantly associated with liability to T2D, fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance; (v) DNA methylation levels at five CpG sites, mapping to three well-characterized genes (TXNIP, ABCG1 and SAMD12) independently explained 7.8% of the heritability of T2D (vi) methylation at these five sites was unlikely to be influenced by neighboring DNA sequence variation. Our study has identified novel epigenetic indicators of T2D risk in Mexican Americans who have increased risk for this disease. These results provide new insights into potential treatment targets of T2D.",

        "# Title: Epigenome-wide association study identifies TXNIP gene associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and sustained hyperglycemia.\n# Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is an established risk factor for a wide range of vascular diseases, including ischemic stroke (IS). Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a marker for average blood glucose levels over the previous 12 weeks, is used as a measure of glycemic control and also as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes (HbA1c levels ≥ 6.5%). Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, may be associated with aging processes and with modulation of the risk of various pathologies, such as DM. Specifically, DNA methylation could be one of the mechanisms mediating the relation between DM and environmental exposures. Our goal was to identify new CpG methylation sites associated with DM. We performed a genome-wide methylation study in whole-blood DNA from an IS patient cohorts. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array was used to measure DNA methylation in CpG sites. All statistical analyses were adjusted for sex, age, hyperlipidemia, body mass index (BMI), smoking habit and cell count. Findings were replicated in two independent cohorts, an IS cohort and a population-based cohort, using the same array. In the discovery phase (N = 355), we identified a CpG site, cg19693031 (located in the TXNIP gene) that was associated with DM (P = 1.17 × 10(-12)); this CpG was replicated in two independent cohorts (N = 167 and N = 645). Methylation of TXNIP was inversely and intensely associated with HbA1c levels (P = 7.3 × 10(-16)), specifically related to diabetic patients with poor control of glucose levels. We identified an association between the TXNIP gene and DM through epigenetic mechanisms, related to sustained hyperglycemia levels (HbA1c ≥ 7%).",

Here we examine whether age-related epigenetic changes affect human islet function and if blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect these changes and associate with future T2D. We analyse DNA methylation genome-wide in islets from 87 non-diabetic donors, aged 26-74 years. Aging associates with increased DNA methylation of 241 sites. These sites cover loci previously associated with T2D, for example, KLF14. Blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related methylation changes in 83 genes identified in human islets (for example, KLF14, FHL2, ZNF518B and FAM123C) and some associate with insulin secretion and T2D. DNA methylation correlates with islet expression of multiple genes, including FHL2, ZNF518B, GNPNAT1 and HLTF. Silencing these genes in β-cells alter insulin secretion. Together, we demonstrate that blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related DNA methylation changes in human islets, and associate with insulin secretion in vivo and T2D.",

To conduct a genome-wide DNA methylation in individuals with type 2 diabetes, individuals with prediabetes, and control mixed ancestry individuals from South Africa. Methods. We used peripheral blood to perform genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in 3 individuals with screen detected diabetes, 3 individuals with prediabetes, and 3 individuals with normoglycaemia from the Bellville South Community, Cape Town, South Africa, who were age-, gender-, body mass index-, and duration of residency-matched. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) was performed by Arraystar Inc. (Rockville, MD, USA). Results. Hypermethylated DMRs were 1160 (81.97%) and 124 (43.20%), respectively, in individuals with diabetes and prediabetes when both were compared to subjects with normoglycaemia. Our data shows that genes related to the immune system, signal transduction, glucose transport, and pancreas development have altered DNA methylation in subjects with prediabetes and diabetes. Pathway analysis based on the functional analysis mapping of genes to KEGG pathways suggested that the linoleic acid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism pathways are hypomethylated in prediabetes and diabetes. Conclusions. Our study suggests that epigenetic changes are likely to be an early process that occurs before the onset of overt diabetes. Detailed analysis of DMRs that shows gradual methylation differences from control versus prediabetes to prediabetes versus diabetes in a larger sample size is required to confirm these findings.",
        "# Title: Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing of Human Pancreatic Islets Reveals Novel Differentially Methylated Regions in Type 2 Diabetes Pathogenesis.\n# Abstract: Current knowledge about the role of epigenetics in type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains limited. Only a few studies have investigated DNA methylation of selected candidate genes or a very small fraction of genomic CpG sites in human pancreatic islets, the tissue of primary pathogenic importance for diabetes. Our aim was to characterize the whole-genome DNA methylation landscape in human pancreatic islets, to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in diabetic islets, and to investigate the function of DMRs in islet biology. Here, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, which is a comprehensive and unbiased method to study DNA methylation throughout the genome at a single nucleotide resolution, in pancreatic islets from donors with T2D and control subjects without diabetes. We identified 25,820 DMRs in islets from individuals with T2D. These DMRs cover loci with known islet function, e.g., PDX1, TCF7L2, and ADCY5 Importantly, binding sites previously identified by ChIP-seq for islet-specific transcription factors, enhancer regions, and different histone marks were enriched in the T2D-associated DMRs. We also identified 457 genes, including NR4A3, PARK2, PID1, SLC2A2, and SOCS2, that had both DMRs and significant expression changes in T2D islets. To mimic the situation in T2D islets, candidate genes were overexpressed or silenced in cultured β-cells. This resulted in impaired insulin secretion, thereby connecting differential methylation to islet dysfunction. We further explored the islet methylome and found a strong link between methylation levels and histone marks. Additionally, DNA methylation in different genomic regions and of different transcript types (i.e., protein coding, noncoding, and pseudogenes) was associated with islet expression levels. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the islet DNA methylome in individuals with and without diabetes and highlights the importance of epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets and T2D pathogenesis."

Sequence-influenced methylations were described in T2DM-associated genomic regions, but evidence for direct, sequence-independent association with disease risk is missing. Here, we explore disease-contributing DNA methylation through a stepwise study design: first, a pool-based, genome-scale screen among 1169 case and control individuals revealed an excess of differentially methylated sites in genomic regions that were previously associated with T2DM through genetic studies. Next, in-depth analyses were performed at selected top-ranking regions. A CpG site in the first intron of the FTO gene showed small (3.35%) but significant (P = 0.000021) hypomethylation of cases relative to controls. The effect was independent of the sequence polymorphism in the region and persists among individuals carrying the sequence-risk alleles. The odds of belonging to the T2DM group increased by 6.1% for every 1% decrease in methylation (OR = 1.061, 95% CI: 1.032-1.090), the odds ratio for decrease of 1 standard deviation of methylation (adjusted to gender) was 1.5856 (95% CI: 1.2824-1.9606) and the sensitivity (area under the curve = 0.638, 95% CI: 0.586-0.690; males = 0.675, females = 0.609) was better than that of the strongest known sequence variant. Furthermore, a prospective study in an independent population cohort revealed significant hypomethylation of young individuals that later progressed to T2DM, relative to the individuals who stayed healthy. Further genomic analysis revealed co-localization with gene enhancers and with binding sites for methylation-sensitive transcriptional regulators. The data showed that low methylation level at the analyzed sites is an early marker of T2DM and suggests a novel mechanism by which early-onset, inter-individual methylation variation at isolated non-promoter genomic sites predisposes to T2DM.",

Epigenetic changes may provide the link for translating environmental exposures into pathological mechanisms. In this study, we performed the first comprehensive DNA methylation profiling in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We uncovered 276 CpG loci affiliated to promoters of 254 genes displaying significant differential DNA methylation in diabetic islets. These methylation changes were not present in blood cells from T2D individuals nor were they experimentally induced in non-diabetic islets by exposure to high glucose. For a subgroup of the differentially methylated genes, concordant transcriptional changes were present. Functional annotation of the aberrantly methylated genes and RNAi experiments highlighted pathways implicated in β-cell survival and function; some are implicated in cellular dysfunction while others facilitate adaptation to stressors. Together, our findings offer new insights into the intricate mechanisms of T2D pathogenesis, underscore the important involvement of epigenetic dysregulation in diabetic islets and may advance our understanding of T2D aetiology.",

To describe the human methylome in pancreatic islets and determine the epigenetic basis of T2D, we analyzed DNA methylation of 479,927 CpG sites and the transcriptome in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We provide a detailed map of the global DNA methylation pattern in human islets, β- and α-cells. Genomic regions close to the transcription start site showed low degrees of methylation and regions further away from the transcription start site such as the gene body, 3'UTR and intergenic regions showed a higher degree of methylation. While CpG islands were hypomethylated, the surrounding 2 kb shores showed an intermediate degree of methylation, whereas regions further away (shelves and open sea) were hypermethylated in human islets, β- and α-cells. We identified 1,649 CpG sites and 853 genes, including TCF7L2, FTO and KCNQ1, with differential DNA methylation in T2D islets after correction for multiple testing. The majority of the differentially methylated CpG sites had an intermediate degree of methylation and were underrepresented in CpG islands (∼ 7%) and overrepresented in the open sea (∼ 60%). 102 of the differentially methylated genes, including CDKN1A, PDE7B, SEPT9 and EXOC3L2, were differentially expressed in T2D islets.

Together, our data can serve as a reference methylome in human islets. We provide new target genes with altered DNA methylation and expression in human T2D islets that contribute to perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion.

Our aim was to dissect molecular mechanisms underlying T2D using genome-wide expression and DNA methylation data in adipose tissue from monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D and independent case-control cohorts. In adipose tissue from diabetic twins, we found decreased expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation; carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism; and increased expression of genes involved in inflammation and glycan degradation. The most differentially expressed genes included ELOVL6, GYS2, FADS1, SPP1 (OPN), CCL18, and IL1RN. We replicated these results in adipose tissue from an independent case-control cohort. Several candidate genes for obesity and T2D (e.g., IRS1 and VEGFA) were differentially expressed in discordant twins. We found a heritable contribution to the genome-wide DNA methylation variability in twins. Differences in methylation between monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D were subsequently modest. However, 15,627 sites, representing 7,046 genes including PPARG, KCNQ1, TCF7L2, and IRS1, showed differential DNA methylation in adipose tissue from unrelated subjects with T2D compared with control subjects. A total of 1,410 of these sites also showed differential DNA methylation in the twins discordant for T2D. For the differentially methylated sites, the heritability estimate was 0.28. We also identified copy number variants (CNVs) in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D. Taken together, subjects with T2D exhibit multiple transcriptional and epigenetic changes in adipose tissue relevant to the development of the disease.",

Here we examine whether age-related epigenetic changes affect human islet function and if blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect these changes and associate with future T2D. We analyse DNA methylation genome-wide in islets from 87 non-diabetic donors, aged 26-74 years. Aging associates with increased DNA methylation of 241 sites. These sites cover loci previously associated with T2D, for example, KLF14. Blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related methylation changes in 83 genes identified in human islets (for example, KLF14, FHL2, ZNF518B and FAM123C) and some associate with insulin secretion and T2D. DNA methylation correlates with islet expression of multiple genes, including FHL2, ZNF518B, GNPNAT1 and HLTF. Silencing these genes in β-cells alter insulin secretion. Together, we demonstrate that blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related DNA methylation changes in human islets, and associate with insulin secretion in vivo and T2D.",
        "# Title: Genome-Wide DNA Methylation in Mixed Ancestry Individuals with Diabetes and Prediabetes from South Africa.\n# Abstract: Aims. To conduct a genome-wide DNA methylation in individuals with type 2 diabetes, individuals with prediabetes, and control mixed ancestry individuals from South Africa. Methods. We used peripheral blood to perform genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in 3 individuals with screen detected diabetes, 3 individuals with prediabetes, and 3 individuals with normoglycaemia from the Bellville South Community, Cape Town, South Africa, who were age-, gender-, body mass index-, and duration of residency-matched. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) was performed by Arraystar Inc. (Rockville, MD, USA). Results. Hypermethylated DMRs were 1160 (81.97%) and 124 (43.20%), respectively, in individuals with diabetes and prediabetes when both were compared to subjects with normoglycaemia. Our data shows that genes related to the immune system, signal transduction, glucose transport, and pancreas development have altered DNA methylation in subjects with prediabetes and diabetes. Pathway analysis based on the functional analysis mapping of genes to KEGG pathways suggested that the linoleic acid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism pathways are hypomethylated in prediabetes and diabetes. Conclusions. Our study suggests that epigenetic changes are likely to be an early process that occurs before the onset of overt diabetes. Detailed analysis of DMRs that shows gradual methylation differences from control versus prediabetes to prediabetes versus diabetes in a larger sample size is required to confirm these findings.",
        "# Title: Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing of Human Pancreatic Islets Reveals Novel Differentially Methylated Regions in Type 2 Diabetes Pathogenesis.\n# Abstract: Current knowledge about the role of epigenetics in type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains limited. Only a few studies have investigated DNA methylation of selected candidate genes or a very small fraction of genomic CpG sites in human pancreatic islets, the tissue of primary pathogenic importance for diabetes. Our aim was to characterize the whole-genome DNA methylation landscape in human pancreatic islets, to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in diabetic islets, and to investigate the function of DMRs in islet biology. Here, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, which is a comprehensive and unbiased method to study DNA methylation throughout the genome at a single nucleotide resolution, in pancreatic islets from donors with T2D and control subjects without diabetes. We identified 25,820 DMRs in islets from individuals with T2D. These DMRs cover loci with known islet function, e.g., PDX1, TCF7L2, and ADCY5 Importantly, binding sites previously identified by ChIP-seq for islet-specific transcription factors, enhancer regions, and different histone marks were enriched in the T2D-associated DMRs. We also identified 457 genes, including NR4A3, PARK2, PID1, SLC2A2, and SOCS2, that had both DMRs and significant expression changes in T2D islets. To mimic the situation in T2D islets, candidate genes were overexpressed or silenced in cultured β-cells. This resulted in impaired insulin secretion, thereby connecting differential methylation to islet dysfunction. We further explored the islet methylome and found a strong link between methylation levels and histone marks. Additionally, DNA methylation in different genomic regions and of different transcript types (i.e., protein coding, noncoding, and pseudogenes) was associated with islet expression levels. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the islet DNA methylome in individuals with and without diabetes and highlights the importance of epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets and T2D pathogenesis."

        "conclusionA": "Across multiple tissues and populations, altered DNA methylation is consistently associated with type 2 diabetes, with replicated findings demonstrating that differential methylation – particularly at sites near genes involved in glucose metabolism, insulin secretion, and inflammation (including *TXNIP*, *FTO*, *TCF7L2*, and *PPARG*) – contributes to disease pathogenesis and, in some cases, precedes disease onset; however, the magnitude of methylation changes is often modest and further research is needed to fully elucidate the functional implications of these epigenetic alterations.",
        "conclusionB": "DNA methylation markers are demonstrably associated with HbA1c levels independently of T2D status and fasting glucose, with *MTNR1A*, *SLC30A8*, and *PPARG* consistently showing such associations; pathway enrichment analyses implicate alterations in insulin signaling, glucose metabolism, and inflammatory responses as key biological processes impacted by these epigenetic changes."

This single-center study was conducted to assess the accuracy of SWE in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), in comparison with transient elastography (TE), by using liver biopsy (LB) as the reference standard. Consecutive patients with CHC scheduled for LB by referring physicians were studied. One hundred and twenty-one patients met inclusion criteria. On the same day, real-time SWE using the ultrasound (US) system, Aixplorer (SuperSonic Imagine S.A., Aix-en-Provence, France), TE using FibroScan (Echosens, Paris, France), and US-assisted LB were consecutively performed. Fibrosis was staged according to the METAVIR scoring system. Analyses of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were performed to calculate optimal area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for F0-F1 versus F2-F4, F0- F2 versus F3-F4, and F0-F3 versus F4 for both real-time SWE and TE. Liver stiffness values increased in parallel with degree of liver fibrosis, both with SWE and TE. AUROCs were 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-0.96) for SWE and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.76-0.90) for TE (P = 0.002), 0.98 (95% CI: 0.94-1.00) for SWE and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.90-0.99) for TE (P = 0.14), and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.93-1.00) for SWE and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.91-0.99) for TE (P = 0.48), when comparing F0-F1 versus F2- F4, F0- F2 versus F3-F4, and F0 -F3 versus F4, respectively.",

Intra- and inter-operator reliability and repeatability were quantified in three different liver segments in a sample of 15 subjects, scanned during four independent sessions (two scans on day 1, two scans 1 wk later) by two operators. A total of 1440 measurements were made. Reproducibility was assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and a repeated measures analysis of variance. The shear wave speed was measured and used to estimate Young's modulus using the Supersonics Imagine Aixplorer. The median Young's modulus measured through the inter-costal space was 5.55 ± 0.74 kPa. The intra-operator reliability was better for same-day evaluations (ICC = 0.91) than the inter-operator reliability (ICC = 0.78). Intra-observer agreement decreased when scans were repeated on a different day. Inter-session repeatability was between 3.3% and 9.9% for intra-day repeated scans, compared with to 6.5%-12% for inter-day repeated scans. No significant difference was observed in subjects with a body mass index greater or less than 25 kg/m(2).",

With this index, the intra-observer acquisition variability assessed by comparing consecutive scans of the same patient was 17% and 32% for HG and LG clips, respectively. The measurement quantification variability assessed by comparing the measurements of a radiologist with those of a trained operator and of two automatic measurements on a same clip averaged 13% and 22% for HG and LG exams, respectively.

The rate of reliable liver stiffness measurements was significantly higher with 2-D SWE than with TE: 99.2% versus 74.8%, p < 0.0001 (different reliability criteria used, according to current recommendations). In univariate analysis, liver stiffness measured with 2-D SWE correlated best with fibrosis stage estimated with TE (r = 0.699, p < 0.0001), followed by Forns score (r = 0.534, p < 0.0001) and King's score (r = 0.512, p < 0.0001). However, in multivariate analysis, only 2-D SWE-measured values remained correlated with fibrosis stage (p < 0.0001). The optimal 2-D SWE cutoff values for predicting significant fibrosis were 8.03 kPa for fibrosis stage ≥2 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.832) and 13.1 kPa for fibrosis stage 4 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.915), respectively. In conclusion, 2-D SWE can be used to obtain reliable liver stiffness measurements in almost all patients and performs very well in predicting the presence of liver cirrhosis.",
        "# Title: Assessment of liver fibrosis with 2-D shear wave elastography in comparison to transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse imaging in patients with chronic liver disease.\n# Abstract: Two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2-D SWE) is an ultrasound-based elastography method integrated into a conventional ultrasound machine. It can evaluate larger regions of interest and, therefore, might be better at determining the overall fibrosis distribution. The aim of this prospective study was to compare 2-D SWE with the two best evaluated liver elastography methods, transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse (point SWE using acoustic radiation force impulse) imaging, in the same population group. The study included 132 patients with chronic hepatopathies, in which liver stiffness was evaluated using transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging and 2-D SWE. The reference methods were liver biopsy for the assessment of liver fibrosis (n = 101) and magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography for the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis (n = 31). No significant difference in diagnostic accuracy, assessed as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), was found between the three elastography methods (2-D SWE, transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging) for the diagnosis of significant and advanced fibrosis and liver cirrhosis in the \"per protocol\" (AUROCs for fibrosis stages ≥2: 0.90, 0.95 and 0.91; for fibrosis stage [F] ≥3: 0.93, 0.95 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.92, 0.96 and 0.92) and \"intention to diagnose\" cohort (AUROCs for F ≥2: 0.87, 0.92 and 0.91; for F ≥3: 0.91, 0.93 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.88, 0.90 and 0.89). Therefore, 2-D SWE, ARFI imaging and transient elastography seem to be comparably good methods for non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis.",

The goal of this study was to assess the clinical use of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) evaluated by supersonic shear imaging (SSI), FibroScan, and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) in a cohort of NAFLD patients who underwent liver biopsy. A total of 291 NAFLD patients were prospectively enrolled from November 2011 to February 2015 at 2 French university hospitals. LSM was assessed by SSI, FibroScan (M probe), and ARFI within two weeks prior to liver biopsy. Calculations of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) were performed and compared for the staging of liver fibrosis. AUROC for SSI, FibroScan, and ARFI were 0.86, 0.82, and 0.77 for diagnoses of ≥F2; 0.89, 0.86, and 0.84 for ≥F3; and 0.88, 0.87, and 0.84 for F4, respectively. SSI had a higher accuracy than ARFI for diagnoses of significant fibrosis (≥F2) (P = 0.004). Clinical factors related to obesity such as body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2) , waist circumference ≥102 cm or increased parietal wall thickness were associated with LSM failures when using SSI or FibroScan and with unreliable results when using ARFI. In univariate analysis, FibroScan values were slightly correlated with NAFLD activity score and steatosis (R = 0.28 and 0.22, respectively), whereas SSI and ARFI were not; however, these components of NAFLD did not affect LSM results in multivariate analysis. The cutoff values for SSI and FibroScan for staging fibrosis with a sensitivity ≥90% were very close: 6.3/6.2 kPa for ≥F2, 8.3/8.2 kPa for ≥F3, and 10.5/9.5 kPa for F4.",

The purpose of this study was to perform an intra-individual comparison between 2-D shear wave elastography (2-D-SWE with a GE system) and Virtual Touch Tissue Quantification (VTTQ with a Siemens system) to assess whether these can be used interchangeably to grade fibrosis. Ninety-three patients (51 men, 42 women; mean age, 54 y) with liver disease of various etiologies (hepatitis B virus = 47, hepatitis C virus = 22; alcohol = 6, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis = 5, other = 13) were included. Using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values, liver fibrosis was classified into clinically non-significant (F0/F1) and significant (≥F2) fibrosis. Results indicated that intra-modality repeatability was excellent for both techniques (GE 2-D-SWE: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.89 [0.84-0.93]; VTTQ: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.90 [0.86-0.93]). Intra-modality classification agreement for fibrosis grading was good to excellent (GE 2-D-SWE: κ = 0.65, VTTQ: κ = 0.82). However, inter-modality agreement for fibrosis grading was only fair (κ = 0.31) using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values of fibrosis.

Twenty children on dialysis intended to perform a 12-week graded community-based exercise program. Exercise capacity and fatigue level were studied; muscle force and health-related quality of life were secondary outcomes. All outcomes were measured at baseline (T = 0) and after intervention (T = 1). Fourteen of the 20 patients (70%) either did not start the program or did not complete the program. Of these patients, seven did not complete or even start the exercise program because of a combination of lack of time and motivational problems. Six patients were not able to continue the program or were unable to do the follow-up measurements because of medical problems.

        "# Title: A pilot study of twice-weekly exercise during hemodialysis in children.\n# Abstract: Few published studies have assessed the exercise capacity and/or the effect of exercise in children receiving maintenance hemodialysis (HD). The aim of this study was to determine if twice-weekly exercise for 1 h during HD could improve exercise capacity in children receiving HD. We assessed lower extremity strength (Biodex; dominant extension peak torque in 60 degrees per second, Newton-meters), grip strength (dynanometer, kilogram) and 6-min walk capacity (yards) in ten children (median age 13.6 years, range 8-25 years) at baseline and after 3 months of twice weekly exercise for 1 h during HD. Baseline assessment revealed a mean (1) Biodex of 70 +/- 32 N-m/s, (2) 6-m walk test of 589 +/- 90 yards and (3) grip strength of 23.2 +/- 10 kg, which were 50% lower than the normal value for healthy controls. Patients demonstrated significant improvements in lower extremity strength and 6-min walk test after 3 months of exercise. Our data show that twice-weekly exercise of a moderate intensity during HD can lead to exercise capacity improvement in 3 months. We identified barriers to and strategies for the successful implementation of intradialytic exercise. We suggest that intradialytic exercise intervention may be effective to improve exercise capacity in children receiving maintenance HD.",

Aerobic, strengthening exercises, and exergames are reported as effective in the treatment of symptoms associated with CKD. Unlike adult patients, there are insufficient studies investigating the effects of exercise on disease-related symptoms in pediatric CKD. This study aimed to compare the effects of Nintendo Wii-based exergaming and home-based fun video exercises on functional capacity, muscle strength, physical activity (PA), depression, fatigue, and QoL in pediatric patients with CKD. Twenty-three pediatric patients with CKD were included in the study and randomized to group I (Nintendo Wii Fit) and group II (home-based fun video exercises). Patients in both groups underwent exercise programs twice per week for 6 weeks. Functional capacity, muscle strength, PA, QoL, fatigue, and depression of the patients were evaluated before and after the treatments. Sixteen patients completed the study. After treatment, significant differences were observed in both groups on 6MWT, muscle strength, average daily steps, PedsQoL Child Self-Report PHSS, and the Visual Fatigue Scale. Left knee flexor muscle strength and average step counts were found to be superior in group I. Both exergaming and home-based fun video exercises provide positive effects on functional capacity, muscle strength, fatigue, PA, depression, and QoL in pediatric patients with CKD. We think that these exercise methods can help to protect physical and mental health of patients and should be included in treatment from the early stages of the disease."

The true incidence of post stroke shoulder pain has not been fully evaluated. In order to establish this, we undertook a prospective study of 123 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of acute stroke during a 6-month period. Patients were assessed by interview, full rheumatological and neurological examination, 14 days post stroke, for a history of shoulder pain according to predetermined criteria. In addition, Barthel Index, HAD score and pain scores were also recorded. Twenty-five percent of patients developed shoulder pain within 2 weeks of their stroke. There was a statistically significant association with ipsilateral sensory impairment (p < 0.005), abnormal rheumatological examination (p < 0.001) and depression score (p < 0.005). We conclude that post stroke shoulder pain is more common than previously realized and in addition to abnormal shoulder joint examination may also be associated with upper limb sensory impairment. Thorough neurological examination is required to detect sensory loss and hence establish patients at risk. This is probably best done by a structured proforma.",

Our approach in vaccine development uses recombinant expression of the highly immunogenic HAV antigen VP1-P2a in food-grade lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis and in Escherichia coli. We used genetic constructs that enable nisin-controlled expression of the antigen in L. lactis in three different forms: (a) intracellularly, (b) on the bacterial surface and (c) on the bacterial surface fused with the fragment of the E. coli flagellin molecule that can act as a molecular adjuvant. Expression of the two surface forms of the antigen was achieved in L. lactis, and the resulting antigen-displaying bacteria were administered orally to mice. Half the animals in each of the two groups developed specific IgGs, with titers increasing over time and reaching 1:422 without flagellin and 1:320 with flagellin. A much higher titer 1:25,803 was observed with the parenterally administered antigen, which was purified from E. coli. With the latter, a significant mucosal IgA response was also observed. Despite significant titers, the IgGs elicited with oral or parenteral administration could not prevent HAV from infecting cells in a virus neutralization assay, suggesting that the antibodies cannot recognize viral surface epitopes. Nevertheless, orally administered HAV antigen expressed in L. lactis elicited significant systemic humoral immune response showing the feasibility for development of effective HAV vaccine for mucosal delivery.",
        "# Title: Oral immunization with recombinant Lactococcus lactis delivering a multi-epitope antigen CTB-UE attenuates Helicobacter pylori infection in mice.\n# Abstract: Urease is an essential virulence factor and colonization factor for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and is considered as an excellent vaccine candidate antigen. However, conventional technologies for preparing an injectable vaccine require purification of the antigenic protein and preparation of an adjuvant. Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 (L. lactis) could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of edible vaccine. In previous study, we constructed a multi-epitope vaccine, designated CTB-UE, which is composed of the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), three Th cell epitopes and two B-cell epitopes from urease subunits. To develop a novel type of oral vaccine against H. pylori, genetically modified L. lactis strains were established to secrete this epitope vaccine extracellularly in this study. Oral prophylactic immunization with recombinant L. lactis significantly elicited humoral anti-urease antibody responses (P < 0.001) and reduced the gastric colonization of H. pylori from 7.14 ± 0.95 to 4.68 ± 0.98 log10 CFU g(-1) stomach. This L. lactis oral vaccine offers a promising vaccine candidate for the control of H. pylori infection.",
        "# Title: Development of a new DNA vaccine based on mycobacterial ESAT-6 antigen delivered by recombinant invasive Lactococcus lactis FnBPA+.\n# Abstract: The use of the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis as a vehicle for the oral delivery of DNA vaccine plasmids constitutes a promising strategy for vaccination. The delivery of DNA plasmids into eukaryotic cells is of critical importance for subsequent DNA expression and effectiveness of the vaccine. In this context, the use of the recombinant invasive L. lactis FnBPA+ (fibronectin-binding protein A) strain for the oral delivery of the eukaryotic expression vector vaccination using lactic acid bacteria (pValac), coding for the 6-kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6) gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, could represent a new DNA vaccine strategy against tuberculosis. To this end, the ESAT-6 sequence was cloned into the pValac vector; the L. lactis fibronectin-binding protein A (FnBPA)+ (pValac:ESAT-6) strain was obtained, and its immunological profile was checked in BALB/c mice. This strain was able to significantly increase interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production in spleen cells, showing a systemic T helper 1 (Th1) cell response. The mice also showed a significant increase in specific secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) production in colon tissue and fecal extracts. Thus, this is the first time that L. lactis has been used to deliver a plasmid DNA harboring a gene that encodes an antigen against tuberculosis through mucous membranes.",
        "# Title: Lactococcus lactis displayed neuraminidase confers cross protective immunity against influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Influenza A viruses pose a serious threat to public health. Current influenza A vaccines predominantly focus on hemagglutinin (HA) and show strain-specific protection. Neuraminidase (NA) is much less studied in the context of humoral immunity against influenza A viruses. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cross protective immunity of NA presented on Lactococcus lactis (L.lactis) surface against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in the mouse model. L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA was constructed in which pgsA was used as an anchor protein. Mice vaccinated orally with L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA could elicit significant NA-specific serum IgG and mucosa IgA antibodies, as well as neuraminidase inhibition (NI) titers. Importantly, L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA provided 80% protection against H5N1, 60% protection against H3N2 and H1N1, respectively. These findings suggest that recombinant L.lactis/pNZ110-pgsA-NA in the absence of adjuvant via oral administration can be served as an effective vaccine candidate against diverse strains of influenza A viruses.",
        "# Title: Broadly protective immunity against divergent influenza viruses by oral co-administration of Lactococcus lactis expressing nucleoprotein adjuvanted with cholera toxin B subunit in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines need to be annually reformulated to well match the predicated circulating strains. Thus, it is critical for developing a novel universal influenza vaccine that would be able to confer cross-protection against constantly emerging divergent influenza virus strains. Influenza virus A is a genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses. Influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) is a structural protein which encapsidates the negative strand viral RNA, and anti-NP antibodies play role in cross-protective immunity. Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) is an ideal vaccine delivery vehicle via oral administration route. However, L. lactis vectored vaccine exhibits poor immunogenicity without the use of mucosal adjuvant. To enhance the immunogenicity of L. lactis vectored vaccine, cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit, one of mucosal adjuvants, is a safe adjuvant for oral route, when combined with L. lactis vectored vaccine. In this study, we hypothesized that pNZ8008, a L. lactis expression plasmid, encoding NP antigen, would be able to elicit cross-protection with the use of CTB via oral administration route.",
        "# Title: Cross-protection of Lactococcus lactis-displayed HA2 subunit against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines provide strain-specific protection against homologous subtypes and need to be updated annually. Therefore, it is essential to develop a universal vaccine that would induce broadly cross-protective immunity against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses. The highly conserved HA2 subunit is a promising candidate for developing a universal influenza vaccine. Here, we hypothesized that the HA2 subunit could be displayed on the surface of Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis), using Spax as an anchor protein (L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2) and that L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 would have immunogenicity by oral administration without the use of adjuvant in the mouse model. To address this hypothesis, we show that oral vaccination of mice with L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 elicited significant humoral and mucosal immune responses. Importantly, L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 provided 100% protection against homologous H5N1 or heterologous H1N1 virus challenge. These results suggest that an HA2 subunit presented on the surface of L. lactis is an effective universal vaccine candidate against influenza A viruses in the poultry industry and in humans.",

Most of the current HIV vaccines under development use the i.m. route for immunization, which is relatively poor in generating potent and long-lived mucosal immune responses. In this article, we explore the ability of an oral vaccination with a probiotic organism, Lactococcus lactis, to elicit HIV-specific immune responses in the mucosal and systemic compartments of BALB/c mice. We expressed the HIV-1 Gag-p24 on the tip of the T3 pilus of Streptococcus pyogenes as a fusion to the Cpa protein (LL-Gag). After four monthly LL-Gag oral immunizations, we observed strong Gag-specific IgG and IgA responses in serum, feces, and vaginal secretions. However, the Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses in the blood were at or below our detection limit. After an i.m. modified vaccinia Ankara/Gag boost, we observed robust Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses both in systemic and in mucosal tissues, including intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes of the small intestine, Peyer's patches, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Consistent with strong immunogenicity, the LL-Gag induced activation of CD11c(+) CD11b(+) dendritic cells in the Peyer's patches after oral immunization. Our results demonstrate that oral immunization with L. lactis expressing an Ag on the tip of the group A Streptococcus pilus serves as an excellent vaccine platform to induce strong mucosal humoral and cellular immunity against HIV.",

        "# Title: Production and delivery of Helicobacter pylori NapA in Lactococcus lactis and its protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity.\n# Abstract: Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein A subunit (NapA) has been identified as a virulence factor, a protective antigen and a potent immunomodulator. NapA shows unique application potentials for anti-H. pylori vaccines and treatment strategies of certain allergic diseases and carcinomas. However, appropriate production and utilization modes of NapA still remain uncertain to date. This work has established a novel efficient production and utilization mode of NapA by using L. lactis as an expression host and delivery vector, and demonstrated immune protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity of the engineered L. lactis by oral vaccination of mice. It was observed for the first time that H. pylori NapA promotes both polarized Th17 and Th1 responses, which may greatly affect the clinical application of NapA. This report offers a promising anti-H. pylori oral vaccine candidate and a potent mucosal immune modulatory agent. Meanwhile, it uncovers a way to produce and deliver the oral vaccine and immunomodulator by fermentation of food like milk, which might have striking effects on control of H. pylori infection, gastrointestinal cancers, and Th2 bias allergic diseases, including many food allergies.",
        "# Title: Protective immunity induced by an intranasal multivalent vaccine comprising 10 Lactococcus lactis strains expressing highly prevalent M-protein antigens derived from Group A Streptococcus.\n# Abstract: Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) causes diseases ranging from mild pharyngitis to severe invasive infections. The N-terminal fragment of streptococcal M protein elicits protective antibodies and is an attractive vaccine target. However, this N- terminal fragment is hypervariable: there are more than 200 different M types. In this study, an intranasal live bacterial vaccine comprising 10 strains of Lactococcus lactis, each expressing one N-terminal fragment of M protein, has been developed. Live bacterial-vectored vaccines cost less to manufacture because the processes involved are less complex than those required for production of protein subunit vaccines. Moreover, intranasal administration does not require syringes or specialized personnel. Evaluation of individual vaccine types (M1, M2, M3, M4, M6, M9, M12, M22, M28 and M77) showed that most of them protected mice against challenge with virulent S. pyogenes. All 10 strains combined in a 10-valent vaccine (M×10) induced serum and bronchoalveolar lavage IgG titers that ranged from three- to 10-fold those of unimmunized mice. After intranasal challenge with M28 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice was significantly higher than that of unimmunized mice. In contrast, when mice were challenged with M75 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice did not differ significantly from that of unimmunized mice. Mx-10 immunized mice had significantly less S. pyogenes in oropharyngeal washes and developed less severe disease symptoms after challenge than did unimmunized mice. Our L. lactis-based vaccine may provide an alternative solution to development of broadly protective group A streptococcal vaccines.",
        "# Title: Mucosal and systemic immune responses elicited by recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a fusion protein composed of pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin from Bordetella pertussis.\n# Abstract: We constructed a food-grade expression system harboring a F1S1 fusion protein of Bordetella pertussis to be produced in Lactococcus lactis NZ3900 as a new oral vaccine model against whooping cough, caused by B. pertussis. F1S1 was composed of N-terminally truncated S1 subunit of pertussis toxin and type I immunodominant domain of filamentous hemagglutinin which are both known as protective immunogens against pertussis. The recombinant L. lactis was administered via oral or intranasal routes to BALB/c mice and the related specific systemic and mucosal immune responses were then evaluated. The results indicated significantly higher levels of specific IgA in the lung extracts and IgG in sera of mucosally-immunized mice, compared to their controls. It was revealed that higher levels of IgG2a, compared to IgG1, were produced in all mucosally-immunized mice. Moreover, immunized mice developed Th1 responses with high levels of IFN-γ production by the spleen cells. These findings provide evidence for L. lactis to be used as a suitable vehicle for expression and delivery of F1S1 fusion protein to mucosa and induction of appropriate systemic and mucosal immune responses against pertussis.",
        "# Title: Rotavirus VP6 protein mucosally delivered by cell wall-derived particles from Lactococcus lactis induces protection against infection in a murine model.\n# Abstract: Rotaviruses are the primary cause of acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide. Although the implementation of live attenuated vaccines has reduced the number of rotavirus-associated deaths, variance in their effectiveness has been reported in different countries. This fact, among other concerns, leads to continuous efforts for the development of new generation of vaccines against rotavirus.In this work, we describe the obtention of cell wall-derived particles from a recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a cell wall-anchored version of the rotavirus VP6 protein. After confirming by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, flow cytometry and electronic immunomicroscopy that these particles were carrying the VP6 protein, their immunogenic potential was evaluated in adult BALB/c mice. For that, mucosal immunizations (oral or intranasal), with or without the dmLT [(double mutant Escherichia coli heat labile toxin LT(R192G/L211A)] adjuvant were performed. The results showed that these cell wall-derived particles were able to generate anti-rotavirus IgG and IgA antibodies only when administered intranasally, whether the adjuvant was present or not. However, the presence of dmLT was necessary to confer protection against rotavirus infection, which was evidenced by a 79.5 percent viral shedding reduction.In summary, this work describes the production of cell wall-derived particles which were able to induce a protective immune response after intranasal immunization. Further studies are needed to characterize the immune response elicited by these particles as well as to determine their potential as an alternative to the use of live L. lactis for mucosal antigen delivery.",

        "# Title: A Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB)-Based Vaccine Candidate for Human Norovirus.\n# Abstract: Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are responsible for more than 95% of the non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis epidemics in the world. The CDC estimates that every year 21 million individuals suffer from HuNoV-induced gastroenteritis in the United States. Currently, there is no FDA-approved vaccine for HuNoVs. Development of an effective vaccine has been hampered by the lack of an efficient cell culture system for HuNoVs and a suitable small animal model for pathogenesis study. In this study, we developed lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as a vector to deliver HuNoV antigen. A LAB strain (Lactococcus lactis) carrying VP1 gene of a HuNoV GII.4 virus (LAB-VP1) was constructed. It was found that HuNoV VP1 protein was highly expressed by LAB vector and was secreted into media supernatants. To test whether LAB-based HuNoV vaccine candidate is immunogenic, 4-day-old gnotobiotic piglets were orally inoculated with various doses of LAB-VP1. It was found that LABs were persistent in the small intestine of piglets and shed in pig feces for at least 25 days post inoculation. LAB DNA and VP1 were detected in mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen tissue in LAB-VP1 inoculated groups. HuNoV-specific IgG and IgA were detectable in serum and feces respectively at day 13 post-inoculation, and further increased at later time points. After being challenged with HuNoV GII.4 strain, a large amount of HuNoV antigens were observed in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum sections of the intestine in the LAB control group. In contrast, significantly less, or no, HuNoV antigens were detected in the LAB-VP1 immunized groups.

        "# Title: Mucosal Vaccination with Lactococcus lactis-Secreting Surface Immunological Protein Induces Humoral and Cellular Immune Protection against Group B Streptococcus in a Murine Model.\n# Abstract: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the primary etiological agent of sepsis and meningitis in newborns and is associated with premature birth and stillbirth. The development of a licensed vaccine is one of the pending challenges for the World Health Organization. Previously, we showed that oral immunization with surface immune protein (SIP) decreases vaginal colonization of GBS and generates functional opsonizing antibodies, which was determined by opsonophagocytic assays (OPA) in vitro. We also showed that the protein has an adjuvant vaccine profile. Therefore, an oral vaccine based on SIP may be an attractive alternative to employ in the development of new vaccines against GBS. Lactococcus lactis is a highlighted oral vaccine probiotic inducer of the mucosal immune response. This bacterium could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of an edible vaccine and has been used in clinical trials. In this study, we showed that an oral vaccine with a recombinant L. lactis strain secreting SIP from GBS (rL. lactis-SIP) can induce protective humoral and cellular immunity in an experimental model of GBS vaginal colonization in C57BL/6 mice. Mice immunized with rL. lactis-SIP were protected against clinical symptoms and bacterial colonization after GBS vaginal colonization. Our rL. lactis-SIP vaccine also induces an increase of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) specifically against SIP. The adoptive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice to naïve mice generated protection against GBS vaginal colonization. Moreover, the rL. lactis-SIP strain induces the activation of SIP-specific T cells, which could decrease GBS vaginal colonization and generate protective antibodies when transferred to other mice. Our experimental observations strongly support the notion that rL. lactis-SIP induces protective humoral and cellular immunity and could be considered as a novel alternative in the development of vaccines for GBS.",
        "# Title: Recombinant Lactococcus Lactis Displaying Omp31 Antigen of Brucella melitensis Can Induce an Immunogenic Response in BALB/c Mice.\n# Abstract: Since Brucella infection mostly occurs through the mucosal surfaces, immune response induced by vaccine that is delivered by a way of mucosal route can be drastically enhanced to control the brucellosis. Omp31is the major outer membrane protein of Brucella, and is considered as a protective antigen against Brucella infection. Accordingly, Lactococcus lactis has been used as an antigen-delivering vector to develop a vaccine-induced mucosal response for having a safer vaccination against brucellosis. A designed omp31 gene fused to the usp45 signal peptide and M6 cell wall anchor was sub cloned in the pNZ7021 expression vector, and a recombinant L. lactis displaying Omp31 was constructed. Omp31 protein expression was confirmed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. Animals were orally and intraperitoneally immunized with live or killed L. lactis expressing Omp31, respectively. The humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated by measuring the specific cytokines and antibodies. sIgA, serum IgA, IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in the mice immunized with live recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31 and also serum IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in mice immunized with killed recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31. Among IgG subtypes, IgG2a response was significantly higher in both groups compared to IgG1. In mice groups immunized with recombinant L. lactis, the IFN-γ and IL-10 level elevated; however, there was no change in the level of IL-4. These results indicated that recombinants L. lactis induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, and also vaccines based on L. lactis-derived live carriers are promising interventions against Brucella melitensis infections.",
        "# Title: Lactococcus lactis FNBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) Induces Cellular and Humoral Immune Responses After Oral Immunization of Mice.\n# Abstract: The development of a new vaccine strategy against tuberculosis is urgently needed and has been greatly encouraged by the scientific community worldwide. In this work, we constructed a lactococcal DNA vaccine based on the fusion of two Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens, ESAT-6 and Ag85A, and examined its immunogenicity. The coding sequences of the ESAT-6 and Ag85A genes were fused and cloned into the eukaryotic expression pValac vector, and the functionality of the vector was confirmed in vitro. Then, L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) was obtained and used for oral immunization of mice. This strain induced significant increases in IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-17 cytokines in stimulated splenocyte cultures, and significant production of antigen-specific sIgA was observed in the colonic tissues of immunized mice. We demonstrated that L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) generated a cellular and humoral immune response after oral immunization of mice. The strategy developed in this work may represent an interesting DNA mucosal vaccine candidate against tuberculosis, using the fusion of two highly immunogenic antigens delivered by safe lactic acid bacteria.",
        "# Title: Protective Immunity Against Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli by Oral Vaccination of Engineered Lactococcus lactis.\n# Abstract: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the leading causes of diarrhea in children globally, and thus suitable vaccines are desired. Antigen display on lactic acid bacteria is a reliable approach for efficient oral vaccination and preventing bowel diseases. To develop an oral vaccine against ETEC, the gene of the binding domain from heat-labile toxin (LTB), a key ETEC virulence factor, was codon-optimized and cloned into a construct containing a signal peptide and an anchor for display on L. lactis. Bioinformatics analysis showed a codon adaptation index of 0.95 for the codon-optimized gene. Cell surface expression of LTB was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and blotting. White New Zealand rabbits were immunized per os (PO) with the recombinant L. lactis, and the antibody titers were assayed with ELISA. In vitro neutralization assay was performed using mouse adrenal tumor cells and rabbit ileal loop test was performed as the in vivo assay. ELISA results indicated that oral administration of the engineered L. lactis elicited a significant production of IgA in the intestine. In vitro neutralization assay showed that the effect of the toxin could be neutralized with 500 µg/ml of IgG isolated from the oral vaccine group. Furthermore, the dose of ETEC causing fluid accumulation in the ileal loop test showed a tenfold increase in rabbits immunized with either recombinant L. lactis or LTB protein compared to other groups. Our results imply that recombinant L. lactis could potentially be an effective live oral vaccine against ETEC toxicity.",
        "# Title: Oral Immunization of Mice with Cell Extracts from Recombinant Lactococcus lactis Expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein.\n# Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all over the world and became a pandemic that named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). At present, several intramuscular vaccines have been successfully developed and mass vaccination has progressed in many countries. The aim of the study is to develop and examine an oral vaccine against COVID-19 with recombinant Lactococcus lactis IL1403, a strain of lactic acid bacteria, expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) S1 subunit as an immunizing antigen. PBS or cell extracts from recombinant L. lactis were orally administered into mice (control VS treatment), and formation of antigen-specific antibodies and changes in the gut microbiome were analyzed. Intracellular antigen was detected, but its secretion was not successful. After immunization, antigen-specific serum IgG and fecal IgA levels were 1.5-fold (P = 0.002) and 1.4-fold (P = 0.016) higher in the immunized mice (treatment) than control, respectively. Gut microbiome profiles were clearly separated between the two groups when analyzed for beta diversity with overall similarity. At the genus level, while Coprococcus (P = 0.036) and unclassified genus of Ruminococcaceae (P = 0.037) in treatment were more abundant than control, rc4-4 (P = 0.013) and Stenotrophomonas (P = 0.021) were less abundant. Our results indicate that cell extract containing SARS-CoV-2 antigen can induce mice to produce antigen-specific antibodies without overall changes in the gut microbiome. This strategy may be useful for the development of other oral viral vaccines.",
        "# Title: Oral Immunization With a M Cell-Targeting Recombinant L. Lactis Vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE Stimulate Protective Immunity Against H. Pylori in Mice.\n# Abstract: There are many virulence factors of H. pylori that contribute in diverse ways to gastric disease. Therefore, designing multivalent epitope vaccines against many key virulence factors virulence factors of H. pylori is a promising strategy to control H. pylori infection. In previous studies, we constructed a multivalent epitope vaccine FVpE against four key virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), and oral immunization with the FVpE vaccine plus a polysaccharide adjuvant (PA) containing lycium barbarum polysaccharide and chitosan could provide protection against H. pylori infection in the Mongolian gerbil model. Oral vaccines have many advantages over injected vaccines, such as improved safety and compliance, and easier manufacturing and administration. However, the harsh gastrointestinal (GI) environment, such as gastric acid and proteolytic enzymes, limits the development of oral vaccines to some extent. Oral vaccines need a gastrointestinal delivery system with high safety, low price and promoting vaccine antigen to stimulate immune response in the gastrointestinal mucosa. Lactic acid bacteria are gastrointestinal probiotics that have unique advantages as a delivery system for oral vaccines. In this study, a M cell-targeting surface display system for L. lactis named plSAM was designed to help vaccine antigens to stimulate effective immune responses in the gastrointestinal tract, and a M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE was constructed by using the surface display system plSAM. recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE could secretively express the SAM-FVpE protein and display it on the bacterial surface. Moreover, experimental results confirmed that LL-plSAM-FVpE had an enhanced M cell-targeting property. In addition, LL-plSAM-FVpE had excellent M cell-targeting property to promote the phagocytosis and transport of the antigen SAM-FVpE by gastrointestinal M cells. More importantly, oral immunization of LL-plSAM-FVpE or SAM-FVpE plus PA can stimulate IgG and sIgA antibodies and CD4+ T cell immune responses against four virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), thus providing protective immunity against H. pylori infection in mice. The M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine against various key H. pylori virulence factors could be a promising vaccine candidate for controlling H. pylori infection.",
        "# Title: Oral and intranasal immunization with food-grade recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing high conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein triggers mice's immunity responses.\n# Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic began at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread throughout the world. Vaccination is still the most effective method of prevention of pathogenic infections, including viral infections. However, there is little evidence that vaccination can protect against SARS-CoV-2 virus for a long time. Thus, regular re-vaccination is necessary to control COVID-19. Vaccination by injection is invasive, and is one of the reasons people refuse to get re-vaccinated. Therefore, we developed a less invasive vaccine based on oral or nasal administration. The gene encoding the high conserved region (HCR) spike protein was inserted into pNZ8149 and expressed in L.lactis NZ3900. Mice were immunized at 3-week intervals with oral or nasal routes. Anti-SARS-CoV2 spike antibody (IgG and IgA) level were measured using ELISA method before and after treatment. Plasma cells population in lymph were analyzed using flowcytometry and the CD4 + and CD8 + cells in lymph and intestine were analyzed using immunofluorescence method. The results of nasal and oral administration in experimental animals showed that L.lactis carrying the HCR gene could induce a humoral immune response, as indicated by increased levels of IgG and IgA against SARS-CoV-2 (IgG/IgA-SARS-CoV-2). The plasma cell population after nasal and oral vaccination in mice were significantly different with control group (p < 0.05). The CD4 + and CD8 + cells in intestine were significantly higher in orally immunized group mice than control group. The CD8 + cells in lymph were significantly higher in intranasal immunized group mice than control group. Our data demonstrate L.lactis expressing spike protein can be developed into a less invasive alternative to nasal and oral vaccination.",
        "# Title: Expanding strain coverage of a group A Streptococcus pilus-expressing Lactococcus lactis mucosal vaccine.\n# Abstract: Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a human pathogenic bacterium that can trigger a wide range of diseases, including the autoimmune diseases acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, causing major morbidity and mortality in many low- and middle-income countries. Primary intervention programs have had limited success thus far, and a licensed vaccine has yet to be developed. The pilus of GAS is known to be involved in host cell adhesion, biofilm formation and immune evasion. We have a mucosal vaccine in development that expresses the pilus of GAS on the surface of the nonpathogenic bacterium Lactococcus lactis. To expand strain coverage, we combined seven L. lactis constructs, each expressing a different GAS pilus variant, and investigated the systemic and mucosal immune responses following immunization. Mice immunized with this combination showed specific immunoglobin G and immunoglobin A responses to the GAS pilus proteins of vaccine strains, at levels comparable to mice immunized with a single construct. Cross-reactivity to pilus proteins of nonvaccine strains was also evident. Furthermore, protective efficacy against a homologous strain of GAS in a murine nasopharyngeal colonization model was observed. Overall, this study provides further evidence for using pilus-expressing lactic acid bacteria as a vaccine to prevent upper respiratory tract GAS infections."

Positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]FDDNP and the determination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of these proteins constitute a means to visualize in vivo Aβ and tau brain accumulation. Information about longitudinal changes of these CSF and PET biomarkers in PD with regard to progression to dementia is lacking. We assessed the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of CSF and PET biomarkers of tau and Aβ with PD-related cognitive dysfunction in 6 healthy-controls (HC), 16 patients with PD without dementia (PDND), and 8 PD with dementia (PDD). All subjects underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing, [18F]FDDNP PET, and CSF Aβ-tau determination. After 18 months, the PDND group was re-assessed clinically and by neuropsychological, PET, and CSF determinations. Cross-sectionally, PDD had higher [18F]FDDNP binding in lateral temporal regions and lower levels of CSF Aβ levels compared to PDND, with a congruent correlation between the [18F]FDDNP binding and CSF Aβ levels. Longitudinally, higher baseline lateral temporal [18F]FDDNP binding was associated to longitudinal worsening in cognitive performances and progression to dementia among subjects classified as PDND at baseline, who additionally disclosed at follow-up an increase in lateral-temporal FDDNP binding, as well as a reduction in CSF Aβ and an increase in CSF tau levels. These results confirm the relevance of these CSF and PET biomarkers to PDD, being specifically the first to show [18F]FDDNP PET as a dementia risk biomarker in PD, along with longitudinal CSF and PET changes over time.",
        "# Title: Positron emission tomography imaging of tau pathology in progressive supranuclear palsy.\n# Abstract: Progressive supranuclear palsy is a rare form of atypical Parkinsonism that differs neuropathologically from other parkinsonian disorders. While many parkinsonian disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia, and multiple system atrophy are classified as synucleinopathies, progressive supranuclear palsy is coined a tauopathy due to the aggregation of pathological tau in the brain. [18F]AV-1451 (also known as [18F]-T807) is a positron emission tomography radiotracer that binds to paired helical filaments of tau in Alzheimer's disease. We investigated whether [18F]AV-1451 could be used as biomarker for the diagnosis and disease progression monitoring in progressive supranuclear palsy. Six progressive supranuclear palsy, six Parkinson's disease, and 10 age-matched healthy controls were recruited. An anatomical MRI and a 90-min PET scan, using [18F]AV-1451, were acquired from all participants. The standardized uptake value ratio from 60 to 90 min post-injection was calculated in each region of interest, using the cerebellar cortex as a reference region. No significant differences in standardized uptake value ratios were detected in our progressive supranuclear palsy group compared to the two control groups. [18F]AV-1451 may bind selectivity to the paired helical filaments in Alzheimer's disease, which differ from the straight conformation of tau filaments in progressive supranuclear palsy.",

[18F]AV-1451 is a positron emission tomography radiotracer designed to bind pathological tau. A post-mortem study using [18F]AV-1451 discovered off-target binding properties to neuromelanin in the substantia nigra. A subsequent clinical study reported a 30% decrease in [18F]AV-1451 binding in the midbrain of PD patients. A total of 12 patients and 10 healthy age-matched controls were recruited. An anatomical MRI and a 90-min PET scan, using [18F]AV-1451, were acquired from all participants. The standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) from 60 to 90 min post-injection was calculated for the substantia nigra, using the cerebellar cortex as the reference region. The substantia nigra was delineated using automated region of interest software. An independent samples ANOVA and LSD post hoc testing were used to test for differences in [18F]AV-1451 SUVR between groups. Substantia nigra SUVR from 60 to 90 min was significantly greater in HC compared to both PSP and PD groups. Although the PD group had the lowest SUVR, there was no significant difference in substantia nigra uptake between PD and PSP. [18F]AV-1451 may be the first PET radiotracer capable of imaging neurodegeneration of the substantia nigra in parkinsonisms.

We therefore wanted to study the retention patterns of 18F-AV-1451 in PD, PD-dementia (PDD), and DLB. To do this 44 healthy controls, 11 non-demented patients with PD, 18 patients with PDD, and six patients with DLB underwent MRI and 18F-AV-1451 PET scanning and cognitive testing. We found that parietal 18F-AV-1451 retention was increased in patients with DLB compared to controls and PD patients, while 18F-AV-1451 uptake was reduced in the substantia nigra in PDD. Increased parietal 18F-AV-1451 PET uptake was associated with impaired performance on verbal fluency tests, and the decreased uptake in the substantia nigra correlated with worse motor function. We found no effect of the monoamine oxidase B inhibitor rasagiline on 18F-AV-1451 binding. In conclusion DLB patients have increased parietal 18F-AV-1451 uptake. Increased parietal tau is associated with executive impairment in patients with synucleinopathies, while decreased uptake in the substantia nigra is associated with parkinsonism. Further, our data indicate that 18F-AV-1451 does not significantly bind to MAO-B in vivo.",

        "# Title: PET Imaging of Astrogliosis and Tau Facilitates Diagnosis of Parkinsonian Syndromes.\n# Abstract: Neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes comprise a number of disorders that are characterized by similar clinical features but are separated on the basis of different pathologies, i.e., aggregates of α-synuclein or tau protein. Due to the overlap of signs and symptoms a precise differentiation is often difficult, especially early in the disease course. Enormous efforts have been taken to develop tau-selective PET imaging agents, but strong off-target binding to monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) has been observed across first generation ligands. Nonetheless, astrogliosis-related MAO-B elevation is a common histopathological known feature of all parkinsonian syndromes and might be itself an interesting imaging target. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the performance of [18F]-THK5351, a combined MAO-B and tau tracer for differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes. [18F]-THK5351 PET was performed in 34 patients: six with Parkinson's disease (PD), nine with multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P), six with MSA with predominant cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C), and 13 with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) Richardson's syndrome. Volume-of-interest-based quantification of standardized-uptake-values was conducted in different parkinsonian syndrome-related target regions. PET results were subjected to multinomial logistic regression to create a prediction model discriminating among groups. Furthermore, we correlated tracer uptake with clinical findings. Elevated [18F]-THK5351 uptake in midbrain and diencephalon differentiated PSP patients from PD and MSA-C. MSA-C patients were distinguishable by high tracer uptake in the pons and cerebellar deep white matter when compared to PSP and PD patients, whereas MSA-P patients tended to show higher tracer uptake in the lentiform nucleus. A multinomial logistic regression classified 33/34 patients into the correct clinical diagnosis group. Tracer uptake in the pons, cerebellar deep white matter, and striatum was closely associated with the presence of cerebellar and parkinsonian symptoms of MSA patients. The current study demonstrates that combined MAO-B and tau binding of THK5351 facilitates differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes. Furthermore, our data indicate a correlation of MSA phenotype with [18F]-THK5351 uptake in certain brain regions, illustrating their relevance for the emergence of clinical symptoms and underlining the potential of THK5351 PET as a biomarker that correlates with pathological changes as well as with disease stage.",

We aimed to investigate its performance in combination with plasma tau levels in patients with non-AD tauopathy. Methods: A total of 47 participants were enrolled, including 10 healthy controls, 16 with tauopathy parkinsonism syndromes (9 with corticobasal syndrome [CBS], 7 with progressive supranuclear palsy [PSP]), 9 with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 4 with AD, and 8 with Parkinson's disease (PD). All participants underwent clinical assessments, 18F-T807 tau PET, brain MRI, and plasma tau assay. Results: The global cortical standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) of 18F-T807 PET was comparable between PD and control (p = 0.088). The cortical SUVR was significantly higher in AD group (p = 0.002) but was modestly increased in PSP group compared to the PD group (p = 0.044), especially in parietal and pallidal regions. Asymmetric 18F-T807 uptake at the pallidum was noted in patients with CBS and FTD. Cortical tau tracer uptake was associated with increased plasma total tau level (p = 0.016), especially in frontal and parietal regions. Regional tracer uptake was correlated with cortical thinning in patients with CBS and PSP (CBS: r = -0.092, p = 0.025; PSP: r = -0.114, p = 0.015). Conclusions: The 18F-T807 tau tracer uptake was only modestly increased in patients with PSP. Although the cortical tau tracer uptake correlated with regional cortical atrophy and plasma tau levels, a four-repeated tau-specific tracer is needed for future classifying tauopathy parkinsonism syndromes.",

Here, we have identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) signature that is associated with the loss of LKB1 function. We discovered that LINC00473 is consistently the most highly induced gene in LKB1-inactivated human primary NSCLC samples and derived cell lines. Elevated LINC00473 expression correlated with poor prognosis, and sustained LINC00473 expression was required for the growth and survival of LKB1-inactivated NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, LINC00473 was induced by LKB1 inactivation and subsequent cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)/CREB-regulated transcription coactivator (CRTC) activation. We determined that LINC00473 is a nuclear lncRNA and interacts with NONO, a component of the cAMP signaling pathway, thereby facilitating CRTC/CREB-mediated transcription. Collectively, our study demonstrates that LINC00473 expression potentially serves as a robust biomarker for tumor LKB1 functional status that can be integrated into clinical trials for patient selection and treatment evaluation, and implicates LINC00473 as a therapeutic target for LKB1-inactivated NSCLC.",
        "# Title: The long noncoding RNA LINC00473, a target of microRNA 34a, promotes tumorigenesis by inhibiting ILF2 degradation in cervical cancer.\n# Abstract: Cervical cancer is one of the most common gynecological malignancies in women worldwide. The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00473 is increased in some human cancer tissues and it plays important roles in tumorigenesis. However, neither the expression pattern nor the biological functions of LINC00473 have been elucidated in cervical cancer so far. In the present study, gain- and loss-of-function assays showed that LINC00473 promoted cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis in cervical cancer cells in vitro. Moreover, we found that LINC00473 enhanced the growth of cervical cancer cells in vivo. Mechanistic investigation showed that LINC00473 directly interacted with ILF2 and suppressed its degradation. Finally, we demonstrated that miR-34a reduced the stability of LINC00473. These findings may have important implications for developing novel therapeutic strategies for cervical cancer.",
        "# Title: Long noncoding RNA LNC473 inhibits the ubiquitination of survivin via association with USP9X and enhances cell proliferation and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.\n# Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Recent studies reported that lncRNA LINC00473 (LNC473) was involved in cancer progression. However, the clinical significance and functional role of LNC473 in HCC progression is still unknown. In the present study, we found that the LNC473 expression was markedly elevated in HCC tissues and correlated with bigger tumor size, higher BCLC stage, vascular invasion and poor prognosis. Gain- and loss-of-function assay showed that LNC473 enhanced HCC cell proliferation and invasion and induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Mechanistically, LNC473 associated with oncoprotein survivin and regulates its stability. Moreover, LNC473 could recruit deubiquitinase USP9X to inhibit the ubiquitination level of survivin and then increase survivin expression. Therefore, our results suggest that LNC473 exerts its functions as an oncogene in HCC progression and may be a therapeutic target for HCC treatment.",
        "# Title: LINC00473 predicts poor prognosis and regulates cell migration and invasion in gastric cancer.\n# Abstract: LINC00473 is an intergenic long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and has been suggested to be dysregulated in several human cancers. However, the clinical value and biological function of LINC00473 in gastric cancer (GC) was still unknown. In our results, LINC00473 expression was increased in GC tissue samples and GC cell lines compared with paired adjacent normal stomach tissue samples and normal gastric epithelial cell line, respectively. High-expression of LINC00473 was correlated with poor histological type, advanced clinical stage, more lymph node metastasis and present distant metastasis. The results of Kaplan-Meier analysis and TCGA database similarly suggested that GC patients with LINC00473 high-expression had poorer prognosis than GC patients with LINC00473 low-expression. Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that LINC00473 high-expression served as independent unfavorable prognostic factor for overall survival in GC patients. The study in vitro indicated that silencing of LINC00473 had no effect on GC cell viability, but inhibited GC cell migration and invasion through modulating MMP2 and MMP9 expression. In conclusion, LINC00473 is associated with the malignant status and prognosis in GC cases, and functions as an oncogenic lncRNA to regulate GC cell migration and invasion.",

        "# Title: Long noncoding RNA LINC00473 functions as a competing endogenous RNA to regulate MAPK1 expression by sponging miR-198 in breast cancer.\n# Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) is one of the primary tumors with high incidence in women. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of LINC00473 and underlying mechanisms in BC. Expression pattern of LINC00473 was analyzed using qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) assays in BC tissues and cells. Overexpression or knockdown of LINC00473 in vitro and functional experiments were performed to study its effects on BC cells. Target prediction, luciferase assays, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and RNA immunoprecipitation were used to verify the role of LINC00473 as a competing endogenous RNA. The impact of LINC00473 on tumor growth was also evaluated using a xenograft model. In our study, we found that LINC00473 was highly expressed in BC tissues and cells, and the elevated expression was correlated with shorter overall survival in patients with BC. Furthermore, knockdown of LINC00473 significantly inhibited the capacity of proliferation, invasion and migration of BC cells. Animal experiment suggested that silencing LINC00473 could significantly inhibit the tumor growth. Following experiments revealed that LINC00473 may function as a competing endogenous RNA to regulate the expression of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1 (MAPK1) through competition for miR-198. Thus, increased expression of LINC00473 in breast cancer tissues is linked to poor prognosis. LINC00473 may function as an endogenous completive RNA by sponging miR-198 to regulate MAPK1 expression. Findings of our study contributed to the basis for further exploring the application of LINC00473 as a prognostic and diagnostic biomarker.",
        "# Title: Long non‑coding RNA LINC00473/miR‑195‑5p promotes glioma progression via YAP1‑TEAD1‑Hippo signaling.\n# Abstract: There is an urgent need to identify novel potential therapeutic targets for diagnosis and treatment of glioma, a common primary tumor in brain, due to its high‑level invasiveness. Long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00473 has been reported as potentially critical regulators in various types of cancer tumorigenesis. However, the effects of LINC00473 on glioma cells is unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the clinical significance, effects and mechanism of LINC00437 on glioma tumorigenesis. In the present study, LINC00473 was significantly increased in glioma tissues and in cell models, and predicted a poor prognosis in patients with glioma. Notably, LINC00473 knockdown not only suppressed cell proliferation, invasion and migration of glioma cells, but also blocked cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis. Subcutaneous xenotransplanted tumor model experiments revealed that reduced LINC00473 expression was able to suppress in vivo glioma growth. Mechanistically, LINC00473 functioned as a competing endogenous (ce)RNA to decrease microRNA (miR)‑195‑5p expression. Moreover, Yes‑associated protein 1 (YAP1) and TEA domain family member 1 (TEAD1) were identified as downstream targets of miR‑195‑5p, whose expression levels were inhibited by miR‑195‑5p. LINC00473 knockdown suppressed glioma progression through the decrease of miR‑195‑5p and subsequent increase of YAP1 and TEAD1 expression levels. These results indicated LINC00473 might act as a ceRNA to sponge miR‑195‑5p, thus promoting YAP1 and TEAD1 expressions, and shedding light on the underlying mechanisms of LINC00473‑induced glioma progression.",
        "# Title: LINC00473 contributes to the radioresistance of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by regulating microRNA‑497‑5p and cell division cycle 25A.\n# Abstract: Long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00473 plays a carcinogenic role in a variety of different tumor types. Nevertheless, the mechanisms through which LINC00473 regulates the radiosensitivity of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells remains elusive. In the present study, reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR was used to quantify the expression of LINC00473, microRNA (miRNA/miR)‑497‑5p and cell division cycle 25A (CDC25A) in ESCC tissues. The association between LINC00473 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with ESCC was also assessed. Furthermore, Cell Counting kit‑8 and colony formation assays were carried out to monitor the proliferation of ESCC cells exposed to X‑ray radiation. A dual‑luciferase reporter assay was also conducted to analyze the interaction between LINC00473 and miR‑497‑5p, as well as the interaction between CDC25A and miR‑497‑5p. The findings of the present study demonstrated that in ESCC tissues and cells, the expression levels of LINC00473 and CDC25A were significantly upregulated, while the expression of miR‑497‑5p was downregulated. The high expression level of LINC00473 was associated with a higher T stage, lymph node metastasis stage and a lower tumor differentiation grade in patients with ESCC. Following irradiation, transfection with miR‑497‑5p mimics reduced the promoting effect of LINC00473 overexpression on ESCC cell proliferation, and partially impeded the resistance of ESCC cells to X‑ray radiation induced by LINC00473 overexpression. Moreover, transfection with miR‑497‑5p inhibitors partially alleviated the inhibitory effects of LINC00473 knockdown on cellular proliferation, and partly reversed the sensitivity of cells to X‑ray irradiation induced by LINC00473 knockdown. Furthermore, it was confirmed that miR‑497‑5p was able to bind LINC00473 and the 3'‑untranslated region of CDC25A. On the whole, the findings of the present study demonstrate that LINC00473 reduces the radiosensitivity of ESCC cells by modulating the miR‑497‑5p/CDC25A axis.",

        "# Title: LNC473 Regulating APAF1 IRES-Dependent Translation via Competitive Sponging miR574 and miR15b: Implications in Colorectal Cancer.\n# Abstract: A growing number of studies have focused on the involvement of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in the internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated translation in tumorigenesis; however, the underlying mechanisms in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain elusive. In this study, we show that LINC00473 (LNC473) exerted its functions as a tumor suppressor in promoting apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF1) IRES activity through competitively sponging miR574-5p and miR15b-5p in CRC initiation and pathogenesis. Specifically, LNC473 and its downstream target APAF1 were significantly downregulated accompanied by upregulated miR574-5p and miR15b-5p in CRC cells and tissues, which had a significant prognostic impact on clinical outcomes in our CRC cohort (n = 157). Furthermore, ectopic LNC473 significantly sponged endogenous miR574-5p or miR15b-5p and thereby inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation capacity, and it accelerated cell apoptosis through activating the APAF1-CASP9-CASP3 pathway. Notably, LNC473 overexpression resulted in dramatic promotion of APAF1 IRES activity and translation, whereas rescue experiments confirmed the recovery by the existence of LNC473 and miR574/15b-5p. Mechanistically, LNC473 overexpression promoted IRES binding domain exposure and removed the constraints controlling from miR574-5p and miR15b-5p, and subsequently enhanced IRES-mediated APAF1 expression in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, our results uncover a novel LNC473-miR574/miR15b-APAF1 signaling axis, which provides new targets and crosstalk regulation mechanism for CRC prevention and treatment.",
        "# Title: Knockdown of LINC00473 promotes radiosensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer cells via sponging miR-513a-3p.\n# Abstract: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung cancer. Radioresistance is a significant obstacle in NSCLC radiotherapy. Long non-coding RNA LINC00473 has been found to impact the radiotherapy in several malignant tumours. This study aimed to investigate the underlying role and mechanism of LINC00473 in regulating radiosensitivity of NSCLC cells. The levels of LINC00473 and miR-513a-3p were measured by quantitative Real-Time PCR. The relationship of LINC00473 with overall survival was tested by the Kaplan-Meier method. The effects of LINC00473 on cell viability and cell survival were assessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony survival assay in NSCLC cells exposed to different doses of radiation. A luciferase reporter assay was used to investigate the correlation between LINC00473 and miR-513a-3p. The present study showed that the relative LINC00473 expression was upregulated and miR-513a-3p expression was downregulated in radioresistant NSCLC patients compared with radiosensitive patients. And upregulated LINC00473 expression was associated with poor prognosis of NSCLC patients after radiotherapy. Radiation led to an increase in LINC00473 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The knockdown of LINC00473 markedly promoted radiosensitivity in NSCLC cells under different doses of radiation. LINC00473 was a sponge of miR-513a-3p and negatively regulated the miR-513a-3p expression. In conclusion, the inhibition of miR-513a-3p markedly reversed the promoted effect of LINC00473 knockdown on cell radiosensitivity. LINC00473 inhibition enhances radiosensitivity of NSCLC by sponging miR-513a-3p, providing a promising therapeutic target to increase the sensitivity of radiotherapy in NSCLC patients.",
        "# Title: lncRNA LINC00473 promotes proliferation, migration, invasion and inhibition of apoptosis of non-small cell lung cancer cells by acting as a sponge of miR-497-5p.\n# Abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-associated death worldwide and exhibits a poor prognosis. The present study aimed to determine the effect of long non-coding (lnc)RNA-LINC00473 on the development of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells by regulating the expression of microRNA (miR)-497-5p. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was conducted to detect the level of LINC00473 and miR-497-5p. An MTT assay, flow cytometry and Transwell tests were performed to evaluate the proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells. Western blotting was performed to detect the expression of apoptosis- and migration-related proteins. RNA immunoprecipitation and a luciferase reporter assay were performed to verify the regulatory relationship between lncRNA-LINC00473 and miR-497-5p. LINC00473 expression was upregulated in lung cancer tissues and NSCLC cells (A549 and H1299) when compared with adjacent tissues or human bronchial epithelial cell lines and the 5-year survival rate was lower in patients with high LINC00473 expression compared with in patients with low LINC00473 expression. A negative correlation between LINC00473 and miR-497-5p was observed in lung cancer tissues. Proliferation, migration and invasion as well as the related protein levels were increased in A549 and H1299 transfected with pcDNA3.1-LINC00473, while the opposite results were obtained in A549 and H1299 transfected with small interfering (si)-LINC00473. Notably, it was demonstrated that LINC00473 could bind directly with miR-497-5p and inhibit its expression. miR-497-5p inhibitors reversed the effect of si-LINC00473. Furthermore, the present study demonstrated that LINC00473 promoted the malignant behaviour of NSCLC cells via regulating the ERK/p38 and MAPK signalling pathways and the expression of miR-497-5p.",
        "# Title: Long intergenic non-coding RNA 00473 promotes proliferation and migration of gastric cancer via the miR-16-5p/CCND2 axis and by regulating AQP3.\n# Abstract: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, but its molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Increasing evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) play a pivotal role in various cancers recently. Our present study focused on exploring the function of long intergenic non-coding RNA 00473 (LINC00473) in GC. In this study, we found that LINC00473 expression was aberrantly increased in tumor tissues compared with the paired para-cancerous tissues. The expression of high LINC00473 in GC was notably correlated with a higher risk of lymphatic metastasis, a higher incidence of vascular cancer embolus, and advanced TNM stage. Further experiments showed that the overexpression of LINC00473 could promote the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells both in vitro and in vivo. The apoptosis of GC cells increased significantly by the decrease of LINC00473. Mechanistically, LINC00473 could sponge miR-16-5p in the cytoplasm and relieve its suppression of CCND2. Moreover, AQP3 was found to be a significant downstream target gene for LINC00473 through RNA transcriptome sequencing, as demonstrated by qRT-PCR and western blot. Overexpression of LINC00473 can partially reverse the effects of AQP3 decrease on GC proliferation and metastasis. LINC00473 regulated AQP3 expression through CREB was confirmed by western blot. Our research indicates that LINC00473/miR-16-5p/CCND2 axis plays a role in the proliferation of GC and modulates AQP3 to influence GC cell metastasis, making it a potential therapeutic target for GC."

Patients were assessed by interview, full rheumatological and neurological examination, 14 days post stroke, for a history of shoulder pain according to predetermined criteria. In addition, Barthel Index, HAD score and pain scores were also recorded. Twenty-five percent of patients developed shoulder pain within 2 weeks of their stroke. There was a statistically significant association with ipsilateral sensory impairment (p < 0.005), abnormal rheumatological examination (p < 0.001) and depression score (p < 0.005). We conclude that post stroke shoulder pain is more common than previously realized and in addition to abnormal shoulder joint examination may also be associated with upper limb sensory impairment.

In this first study of a thrombopoietic agent in children, patients with ITP of ≥ 6 months' duration were stratified by age 1:2:2 (12 months-< 3 years; 3-< 12 years; 12-< 18 years). Children received subcutaneous injections of romiplostim (n = 17) or placebo (n = 5) weekly for 12 weeks, with dose adjustments to maintain platelet counts between 50 × 10(9)/L and 250 × 10(9)/L. A platelet count ≥ 50 × 10(9)/L for 2 consecutive weeks was achieved by 15/17 (88%) patients in the romiplostim group and no patients in the placebo group (P = .0008). Platelet counts ≥ 50 × 10(9)/L were maintained for a median of 7 (range, 0-11) weeks in romiplostim patients and 0 (0-0) weeks in placebo patients (P = .0019). The median weekly dose of romiplostim at 12 weeks was 5 μg/kg. Fourteen responders received romiplostim for 4 additional weeks for assessment of pharmacokinetics. No patients discontinued the study. There were no treatment-related, serious adverse events. The most commonly reported adverse events in children, as in adults, were headache and epistaxis. In this short-term study, romiplostim increased platelet counts in 88% of children with ITP and was well-tolerated and apparently safe.

Thirty-four ITP patients received romiplostim (n = 22) or placebo (n = 12) for 12 weeks, with a starting romiplostim dose of 3 μg/kg weekly. The primary end point was the number of weeks with platelet response, defined as a platelet count ≥50 × 10(9)/L (not including the 4 weeks after rescue medication administration). Patients received a median of 4 (range 1-19) prior ITP therapies including splenectomy in 44%. On study, 68% also received concomitant ITP therapy. Weekly responses occurred for a median of 11 weeks with romiplostim as compared to 0 weeks with placebo (p < 0.0001). Most romiplostim-treated patients (95%) achieved platelet responses; two showed extended responses after the treatment period. The use of rescue medication was required in 9% of romiplostim-treated patients as compared with 17% of placebo-treated patients. Both treatment groups had similar incidences of adverse events (91% romiplostim, 92% placebo). Adverse events that occurred more frequently (>10%) in romiplostim-treated patients included nasopharyngitis, headache, peripheral edema, back pain, and extremity pain. In conclusion, romiplostim significantly increased and maintained platelet counts and was well tolerated in Japanese patients with ITP.",

The resulting thrombocytopenia reduces patient health-related quality of life (HRQOL). In a randomized, open-label, 52-week study of non-splenectomized ITP patients treated with romiplostim or medical standard of care (SOC), patients completed the 10-scale ITP-patient assessment questionnaire (PAQ) at the start of the study and after 12, 24, 36, 48,and 52 weeks of treatment. HRQOL changes were examined for all patients in both treatment groups and by responder status, splenectomy status, and after the use of rituximab. Patients in both groups showed marked increases in all HRQOL scales over 52 weeks of treatment.These change scores exceeded the minimally important difference values (a measure of clinical relevance) for most of these scales,especially in responders to treatment. Compared with baseline,patients receiving romiplostim showed statistically significant improvements compared to SOC over 52 weeks for the ITP-PAQ scales of Symptoms, Bother, Activity, Psychological Health, Fear, Overall QOL,and Social QOL. Overall, treatment of ITP was associated with improvement in HRQOL.

The two most commonly used autogenous grafts are the central third of the patellar tendon and the hamstring tendon constructs. The choice of different grafts and different construct influence the final clinical outcome of ACL reconstruction. The 3 groups, of 25 patients each, were generated by choosing the technique (PT tendon, 4 strand hamstring, and single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty) to utilize and followed for 5 years, with an alternate systematic sampling. Our comparison has shown significant kneeling pain in the patellar tendon with respect to the groups with hamstrings techniques. Single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty achieved subjective score significantly higher with respect to the other two groups as well as for the time to resume sport. The study confirms that patellar tendon and hamstring can be equivalent options for ACL reconstruction. This study demonstrated that a superior outcome as far as subjective clinical findings were concerned, was obtained in group III. Patients in the latter group were also able to return to sports sooner than those in the bone-patellar tendon graft group and the four-strand hamstring group.",

Fifty patients who underwent ACLR with versus without ALLR were analyzed at four different time points (preoperatively and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively). For the functional outcomes, muscle strength and acceleration time (AT) were measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. Proprioception was evaluated using joint position sense and dynamic postural stability. Patient-reported outcomes were measured using the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK-11) scores. Functional performance was assessed using single-leg hop distance (SLHD) and Limb Symmetry Index. In the operated knees, quadriceps (at 6 months postoperatively, p = 0.003) and hamstring (at 6 and 12 months postoperatively, p < 0.001) strength were significantly higher in the combined ACLR and ALLR group than the isolated ACLR group. The TSK-11 (at 6 and 12 months postoperatively, p < 0.001) was significantly lower in the combined ACLR and ALLR group than the isolated ACLR group. SLHD was significantly higher in the combined ACLR and ALLR group than the isolated ACLR group (at 6 months, p = 0.022 and at 12 months, p = 0.024). The addition of ALLR to primary ACLR yielded better muscle performance, fear of movement, and functional performance than isolated ACLR."

Loss of LKB1 promotes cancer progression and influences therapeutic responses in preclinical studies; however, specific targeted therapies for lung cancer with LKB1 inactivation are currently unavailable. Here, we have identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) signature that is associated with the loss of LKB1 function. We discovered that LINC00473 is consistently the most highly induced gene in LKB1-inactivated human primary NSCLC samples and derived cell lines. Elevated LINC00473 expression correlated with poor prognosis, and sustained LINC00473 expression was required for the growth and survival of LKB1-inactivated NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, LINC00473 was induced by LKB1 inactivation and subsequent cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)/CREB-regulated transcription coactivator (CRTC) activation. We determined that LINC00473 is a nuclear lncRNA and interacts with NONO, a component of the cAMP signaling pathway, thereby facilitating CRTC/CREB-mediated transcription. Collectively, our study demonstrates that LINC00473 expression potentially serves as a robust biomarker for tumor LKB1 functional status that can be integrated into clinical trials for patient selection and treatment evaluation, and implicates LINC00473 as a therapeutic target for LKB1-inactivated NSCLC.",

The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00473 is increased in some human cancer tissues and it plays important roles in tumorigenesis. However, neither the expression pattern nor the biological functions of LINC00473 have been elucidated in cervical cancer so far. In the present study, gain- and loss-of-function assays showed that LINC00473 promoted cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis in cervical cancer cells in vitro. Moreover, we found that LINC00473 enhanced the growth of cervical cancer cells in vivo. Mechanistic investigation showed that LINC00473 directly interacted with ILF2 and suppressed its degradation. Finally, we demonstrated that miR-34a reduced the stability of LINC00473. These findings may have important implications for developing novel therapeutic strategies for cervical cancer.",
        "# Title: Long noncoding RNA LNC473 inhibits the ubiquitination of survivin via association with USP9X and enhances cell proliferation and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.\n# Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Recent studies reported that lncRNA LINC00473 (LNC473) was involved in cancer progression. However, the clinical significance and functional role of LNC473 in HCC progression is still unknown. In the present study, we found that the LNC473 expression was markedly elevated in HCC tissues and correlated with bigger tumor size, higher BCLC stage, vascular invasion and poor prognosis. Gain- and loss-of-function assay showed that LNC473 enhanced HCC cell proliferation and invasion and induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Mechanistically, LNC473 associated with oncoprotein survivin and regulates its stability. Moreover, LNC473 could recruit deubiquitinase USP9X to inhibit the ubiquitination level of survivin and then increase survivin expression. Therefore, our results suggest that LNC473 exerts its functions as an oncogene in HCC progression and may be a therapeutic target for HCC treatment.",

However, the clinical value and biological function of LINC00473 in gastric cancer (GC) was still unknown. In our results, LINC00473 expression was increased in GC tissue samples and GC cell lines compared with paired adjacent normal stomach tissue samples and normal gastric epithelial cell line, respectively. High-expression of LINC00473 was correlated with poor histological type, advanced clinical stage, more lymph node metastasis and present distant metastasis. The results of Kaplan-Meier analysis and TCGA database similarly suggested that GC patients with LINC00473 high-expression had poorer prognosis than GC patients with LINC00473 low-expression. Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that LINC00473 high-expression served as independent unfavorable prognostic factor for overall survival in GC patients. The study in vitro indicated that silencing of LINC00473 had no effect on GC cell viability, but inhibited GC cell migration and invasion through modulating MMP2 and MMP9 expression. In conclusion, LINC00473 is associated with the malignant status and prognosis in GC cases, and functions as an oncogenic lncRNA to regulate GC cell migration and invasion.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of LINC00473 and underlying mechanisms in BC. Expression pattern of LINC00473 was analyzed using qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) assays in BC tissues and cells. Overexpression or knockdown of LINC00473 in vitro and functional experiments were performed to study its effects on BC cells. Target prediction, luciferase assays, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and RNA immunoprecipitation were used to verify the role of LINC00473 as a competing endogenous RNA. The impact of LINC00473 on tumor growth was also evaluated using a xenograft model. In our study, we found that LINC00473 was highly expressed in BC tissues and cells, and the elevated expression was correlated with shorter overall survival in patients with BC. Furthermore, knockdown of LINC00473 significantly inhibited the capacity of proliferation, invasion and migration of BC cells. Animal experiment suggested that silencing LINC00473 could significantly inhibit the tumor growth. Following experiments revealed that LINC00473 may function as a competing endogenous RNA to regulate the expression of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1 (MAPK1) through competition for miR-198. Thus, increased expression of LINC00473 in breast cancer tissues is linked to poor prognosis. LINC00473 may function as an endogenous completive RNA by sponging miR-198 to regulate MAPK1 expression. Findings of our study contributed to the basis for further exploring the application of LINC00473 as a prognostic and diagnostic biomarker.",

Long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00473 has been reported as potentially critical regulators in various types of cancer tumorigenesis. However, the effects of LINC00473 on glioma cells is unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the clinical significance, effects and mechanism of LINC00437 on glioma tumorigenesis. In the present study, LINC00473 was significantly increased in glioma tissues and in cell models, and predicted a poor prognosis in patients with glioma. Notably, LINC00473 knockdown not only suppressed cell proliferation, invasion and migration of glioma cells, but also blocked cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis. Subcutaneous xenotransplanted tumor model experiments revealed that reduced LINC00473 expression was able to suppress in vivo glioma growth. Mechanistically, LINC00473 functioned as a competing endogenous (ce)RNA to decrease microRNA (miR)‑195‑5p expression. Moreover, Yes‑associated protein 1 (YAP1) and TEA domain family member 1 (TEAD1) were identified as downstream targets of miR‑195‑5p, whose expression levels were inhibited by miR‑195‑5p. LINC00473 knockdown suppressed glioma progression through the decrease of miR‑195‑5p and subsequent increase of YAP1 and TEAD1 expression levels. These results indicated LINC00473 might act as a ceRNA to sponge miR‑195‑5p, thus promoting YAP1 and TEAD1 expressions, and shedding light on the underlying mechanisms of LINC00473‑induced glioma progression.",
        "# Title: LINC00473 contributes to the radioresistance of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by regulating microRNA‑497‑5p and cell division cycle 25A.\n# Abstract: Long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00473 plays a carcinogenic role in a variety of different tumor types. Nevertheless, the mechanisms through which LINC00473 regulates the radiosensitivity of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells remains elusive. In the present study, reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR was used to quantify the expression of LINC00473, microRNA (miRNA/miR)‑497‑5p and cell division cycle 25A (CDC25A) in ESCC tissues. The association between LINC00473 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with ESCC was also assessed. Furthermore, Cell Counting kit‑8 and colony formation assays were carried out to monitor the proliferation of ESCC cells exposed to X‑ray radiation. A dual‑luciferase reporter assay was also conducted to analyze the interaction between LINC00473 and miR‑497‑5p, as well as the interaction between CDC25A and miR‑497‑5p. The findings of the present study demonstrated that in ESCC tissues and cells, the expression levels of LINC00473 and CDC25A were significantly upregulated, while the expression of miR‑497‑5p was downregulated. The high expression level of LINC00473 was associated with a higher T stage, lymph node metastasis stage and a lower tumor differentiation grade in patients with ESCC. Following irradiation, transfection with miR‑497‑5p mimics reduced the promoting effect of LINC00473 overexpression on ESCC cell proliferation, and partially impeded the resistance of ESCC cells to X‑ray radiation induced by LINC00473 overexpression. Moreover, transfection with miR‑497‑5p inhibitors partially alleviated the inhibitory effects of LINC00473 knockdown on cellular proliferation, and partly reversed the sensitivity of cells to X‑ray irradiation induced by LINC00473 knockdown. Furthermore, it was confirmed that miR‑497‑5p was able to bind LINC00473 and the 3'‑untranslated region of CDC25A. On the whole, the findings of the present study demonstrate that LINC00473 reduces the radiosensitivity of ESCC cells by modulating the miR‑497‑5p/CDC25A axis.",

        "# Title: LNC473 Regulating APAF1 IRES-Dependent Translation via Competitive Sponging miR574 and miR15b: Implications in Colorectal Cancer.\n# Abstract: A growing number of studies have focused on the involvement of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in the internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated translation in tumorigenesis; however, the underlying mechanisms in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain elusive. In this study, we show that LINC00473 (LNC473) exerted its functions as a tumor suppressor in promoting apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF1) IRES activity through competitively sponging miR574-5p and miR15b-5p in CRC initiation and pathogenesis. Specifically, LNC473 and its downstream target APAF1 were significantly downregulated accompanied by upregulated miR574-5p and miR15b-5p in CRC cells and tissues, which had a significant prognostic impact on clinical outcomes in our CRC cohort (n = 157). Furthermore, ectopic LNC473 significantly sponged endogenous miR574-5p or miR15b-5p and thereby inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation capacity, and it accelerated cell apoptosis through activating the APAF1-CASP9-CASP3 pathway. Notably, LNC473 overexpression resulted in dramatic promotion of APAF1 IRES activity and translation, whereas rescue experiments confirmed the recovery by the existence of LNC473 and miR574/15b-5p. Mechanistically, LNC473 overexpression promoted IRES binding domain exposure and removed the constraints controlling from miR574-5p and miR15b-5p, and subsequently enhanced IRES-mediated APAF1 expression in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, our results uncover a novel LNC473-miR574/miR15b-APAF1 signaling axis, which provides new targets and crosstalk regulation mechanism for CRC prevention and treatment.",
        "# Title: Knockdown of LINC00473 promotes radiosensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer cells via sponging miR-513a-3p.\n# Abstract: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung cancer. Radioresistance is a significant obstacle in NSCLC radiotherapy. Long non-coding RNA LINC00473 has been found to impact the radiotherapy in several malignant tumours. This study aimed to investigate the underlying role and mechanism of LINC00473 in regulating radiosensitivity of NSCLC cells. The levels of LINC00473 and miR-513a-3p were measured by quantitative Real-Time PCR. The relationship of LINC00473 with overall survival was tested by the Kaplan-Meier method. The effects of LINC00473 on cell viability and cell survival were assessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony survival assay in NSCLC cells exposed to different doses of radiation. A luciferase reporter assay was used to investigate the correlation between LINC00473 and miR-513a-3p. The present study showed that the relative LINC00473 expression was upregulated and miR-513a-3p expression was downregulated in radioresistant NSCLC patients compared with radiosensitive patients. And upregulated LINC00473 expression was associated with poor prognosis of NSCLC patients after radiotherapy. Radiation led to an increase in LINC00473 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The knockdown of LINC00473 markedly promoted radiosensitivity in NSCLC cells under different doses of radiation. LINC00473 was a sponge of miR-513a-3p and negatively regulated the miR-513a-3p expression. In conclusion, the inhibition of miR-513a-3p markedly reversed the promoted effect of LINC00473 knockdown on cell radiosensitivity. LINC00473 inhibition enhances radiosensitivity of NSCLC by sponging miR-513a-3p, providing a promising therapeutic target to increase the sensitivity of radiotherapy in NSCLC patients.",
        "# Title: lncRNA LINC00473 promotes proliferation, migration, invasion and inhibition of apoptosis of non-small cell lung cancer cells by acting as a sponge of miR-497-5p.\n# Abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-associated death worldwide and exhibits a poor prognosis. The present study aimed to determine the effect of long non-coding (lnc)RNA-LINC00473 on the development of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells by regulating the expression of microRNA (miR)-497-5p. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was conducted to detect the level of LINC00473 and miR-497-5p. An MTT assay, flow cytometry and Transwell tests were performed to evaluate the proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells. Western blotting was performed to detect the expression of apoptosis- and migration-related proteins. RNA immunoprecipitation and a luciferase reporter assay were performed to verify the regulatory relationship between lncRNA-LINC00473 and miR-497-5p. LINC00473 expression was upregulated in lung cancer tissues and NSCLC cells (A549 and H1299) when compared with adjacent tissues or human bronchial epithelial cell lines and the 5-year survival rate was lower in patients with high LINC00473 expression compared with in patients with low LINC00473 expression. A negative correlation between LINC00473 and miR-497-5p was observed in lung cancer tissues. Proliferation, migration and invasion as well as the related protein levels were increased in A549 and H1299 transfected with pcDNA3.1-LINC00473, while the opposite results were obtained in A549 and H1299 transfected with small interfering (si)-LINC00473. Notably, it was demonstrated that LINC00473 could bind directly with miR-497-5p and inhibit its expression. miR-497-5p inhibitors reversed the effect of si-LINC00473. Furthermore, the present study demonstrated that LINC00473 promoted the malignant behaviour of NSCLC cells via regulating the ERK/p38 and MAPK signalling pathways and the expression of miR-497-5p.",
        "# Title: Long intergenic non-coding RNA 00473 promotes proliferation and migration of gastric cancer via the miR-16-5p/CCND2 axis and by regulating AQP3.\n# Abstract: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, but its molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Increasing evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) play a pivotal role in various cancers recently. Our present study focused on exploring the function of long intergenic non-coding RNA 00473 (LINC00473) in GC. In this study, we found that LINC00473 expression was aberrantly increased in tumor tissues compared with the paired para-cancerous tissues. The expression of high LINC00473 in GC was notably correlated with a higher risk of lymphatic metastasis, a higher incidence of vascular cancer embolus, and advanced TNM stage. Further experiments showed that the overexpression of LINC00473 could promote the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells both in vitro and in vivo. The apoptosis of GC cells increased significantly by the decrease of LINC00473. Mechanistically, LINC00473 could sponge miR-16-5p in the cytoplasm and relieve its suppression of CCND2. Moreover, AQP3 was found to be a significant downstream target gene for LINC00473 through RNA transcriptome sequencing, as demonstrated by qRT-PCR and western blot. Overexpression of LINC00473 can partially reverse the effects of AQP3 decrease on GC proliferation and metastasis. LINC00473 regulated AQP3 expression through CREB was confirmed by western blot. Our research indicates that LINC00473/miR-16-5p/CCND2 axis plays a role in the proliferation of GC and modulates AQP3 to influence GC cell metastasis, making it a potential therapeutic target for GC."

However, the contributions of lncRNAs to gastric carcinoma and their functional mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that lncRNA gastric carcinoma high expressed transcript 1 (lncRNA-GHET1) was up-regulated in gastric carcinoma. The over-expression of this lncRNA correlates with tumor size, tumor invasion and poor survival. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses demonstrated that GHET1 over-expression promotes the proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of GHET1 inhibits the proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells. RNA pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that GHET1 physically associates with insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) and enhances the physical interaction between c-Myc mRNA and IGF2BP1, consequently increasing the stability of c-Myc mRNA and expression. The expression of GHET1 and c-Myc is strongly correlated in gastric carcinoma tissues. Depletion of c-Myc abolishes the effects of GHET1 on proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that GHET1 plays a pivotal role in gastric carcinoma cell proliferation via increasing c-Myc mRNA stability and expression, which suggests potential use of GHET1 for the prognosis and treatment of gastric carcinoma.",

As a result, it is vital to identify novel diagnostic and prognostic marker of bladder cancer. A growing volume of literature has implicated the vital role of long noncoding RNA in the development of cancer. GHET1, a recently identified lncRNA, was initially characterized in gastric cancer. However, its role in bladder cancer remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that GHET1 was upregulated in bladder cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues and its over-expression correlates with tumor size, advanced tumor and lymph node status, and poor survival. GHET1 knockdown suppressed the proliferation and invasion of bladder cancer cells in vitro. In the meantime, inhibition of GHET1 reversed the epithelial-mesenchymal-transition in bladder cancer cell line. Taken together, our study suggests that the potential use of GHET1 as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target of bladder cancer.",

Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) attract much attention of researchers, and they are demonstrated to be dysregulated in a variety of cancers, including HCC. LncRNA gastric carcinoma high expressed transcript 1 lncRNA GHET1 is found to be dysregulated in gastric cancer (GC). However, its clinical value and potential biological function in HCC remains unclear. In this study, the expression level of GHET1 was analyzed in 72 HCC tissues and matched normal tissues by using Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). GHET1 expression was significantly up-regulated in HCC tissues and the higher level of GHET1 was related to vascular invasion, cirrhosis, tumor size, edmindson grade, and poor prognosis. Moreover, knockdown of GHET1 inhibited cell proliferation of HCC, and also caused cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis in HCC cell lines.

In the present study, the expression patterns of GHET1 in HNC were determined and its clinical significance was assessed. The expression level of GHET1 was significantly increased in HNC tissues, compared with paired adjacent normal tissues. High GHET1 expression was significantly associated with advanced Tumor-Node-Metastasis stages and poor prognosis. Furthermore, inhibition of GHET1 suppressed cell proliferation, induced cell apoptosis and caused cell cycle arrest in vitro. In addition, GHET1 silencing inhibited cell migration and invasion. Taken together, the results of the present study indicated that GHET1 acts as an oncogene in HNC and may represent a novel therapeutic target.",

        "# Title: Knockdown of long noncoding RNA GHET1 inhibits cell‑cycle progression and invasion of gastric cancer cells.\n# Abstract: GHET1 is an oncogenic long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that promotes the proliferation and invasion of many malignant cell types. However, the function and underlying mechanisms of lncRNA GHET1 in gastric cancer are not fully understood. In this study, the expression of GHET1 was investigated in gastric cancer and it was determined whether GHET1 may potentially be used as a biomarker for the disease. The gastric cancer cell lines MGC‑803 and AGS were transfected with GHET1‑directed small interfering RNA (siRNA) and the changes in phenotype and cell‑cycle‑related molecules were assessed. The downregulation of GHET1 induced G0/G1‑phase arrest in gastric cancer cells and inhibited their proliferation, migration, and invasion. DNA synthesis and the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) decreased, which was consistent with the results of the CCK‑8 assay. The levels of specific cell‑cycle regulators were determined and the expression and activities of positive cell‑cycle regulators (cyclin D, CDK4, CDK6, cyclin E, CDK2) were reduced, whereas those of a negative regulator (P21) were increased in GHET1‑knockdown cells. Taken together, the present findings show that the downregulation of GHET1 not only inhibits the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells, but also inhibits their proliferation, at least in part by upregulating P21 expression and downregulating cyclin and CDK expression to inhibit the G0/G1 to S phase transition. The present findings may provide a potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer."

This single-center study was conducted to assess the accuracy of SWE in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), in comparison with transient elastography (TE), by using liver biopsy (LB) as the reference standard. Consecutive patients with CHC scheduled for LB by referring physicians were studied. One hundred and twenty-one patients met inclusion criteria. On the same day, real-time SWE using the ultrasound (US) system, Aixplorer (SuperSonic Imagine S.A., Aix-en-Provence, France), TE using FibroScan (Echosens, Paris, France), and US-assisted LB were consecutively performed. Fibrosis was staged according to the METAVIR scoring system. Analyses of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were performed to calculate optimal area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for F0-F1 versus F2-F4, F0- F2 versus F3-F4, and F0-F3 versus F4 for both real-time SWE and TE. Liver stiffness values increased in parallel with degree of liver fibrosis, both with SWE and TE. AUROCs were 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-0.96) for SWE and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.76-0.90) for TE (P = 0.002), 0.98 (95% CI: 0.94-1.00) for SWE and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.90-0.99) for TE (P = 0.14), and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.93-1.00) for SWE and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.91-0.99) for TE (P = 0.48), when comparing F0-F1 versus F2- F4, F0- F2 versus F3-F4, and F0 -F3 versus F4, respectively.",

A total of 1440 measurements were made. Reproducibility was assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and a repeated measures analysis of variance. The shear wave speed was measured and used to estimate Young's modulus using the Supersonics Imagine Aixplorer. The median Young's modulus measured through the inter-costal space was 5.55 ± 0.74 kPa. The intra-operator reliability was better for same-day evaluations (ICC = 0.91) than the inter-operator reliability (ICC = 0.78). Intra-observer agreement decreased when scans were repeated on a different day. Inter-session repeatability was between 3.3% and 9.9% for intra-day repeated scans, compared with to 6.5%-12% for inter-day repeated scans. No significant difference was observed in subjects with a body mass index greater or less than 25 kg/m(2).",

The measurement quantification variability assessed by comparing the measurements of a radiologist with those of a trained operator and of two automatic measurements on a same clip averaged 13% and 22% for HG and LG exams, respectively.

The rate of reliable liver stiffness measurements was significantly higher with 2-D SWE than with TE: 99.2% versus 74.8%, p < 0.0001 (different reliability criteria used, according to current recommendations). In univariate analysis, liver stiffness measured with 2-D SWE correlated best with fibrosis stage estimated with TE (r = 0.699, p < 0.0001), followed by Forns score (r = 0.534, p < 0.0001) and King's score (r = 0.512, p < 0.0001). However, in multivariate analysis, only 2-D SWE-measured values remained correlated with fibrosis stage (p < 0.0001). The optimal 2-D SWE cutoff values for predicting significant fibrosis were 8.03 kPa for fibrosis stage ≥2 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.832) and 13.1 kPa for fibrosis stage 4 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.915), respectively. In conclusion, 2-D SWE can be used to obtain reliable liver stiffness measurements in almost all patients and performs very well in predicting the presence of liver cirrhosis.",
        "# Title: Assessment of liver fibrosis with 2-D shear wave elastography in comparison to transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse imaging in patients with chronic liver disease.\n# Abstract: Two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2-D SWE) is an ultrasound-based elastography method integrated into a conventional ultrasound machine. It can evaluate larger regions of interest and, therefore, might be better at determining the overall fibrosis distribution. The aim of this prospective study was to compare 2-D SWE with the two best evaluated liver elastography methods, transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse (point SWE using acoustic radiation force impulse) imaging, in the same population group. The study included 132 patients with chronic hepatopathies, in which liver stiffness was evaluated using transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging and 2-D SWE. The reference methods were liver biopsy for the assessment of liver fibrosis (n = 101) and magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography for the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis (n = 31). No significant difference in diagnostic accuracy, assessed as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), was found between the three elastography methods (2-D SWE, transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging) for the diagnosis of significant and advanced fibrosis and liver cirrhosis in the \"per protocol\" (AUROCs for fibrosis stages ≥2: 0.90, 0.95 and 0.91; for fibrosis stage [F] ≥3: 0.93, 0.95 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.92, 0.96 and 0.92) and \"intention to diagnose\" cohort (AUROCs for F ≥2: 0.87, 0.92 and 0.91; for F ≥3: 0.91, 0.93 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.88, 0.90 and 0.89). Therefore, 2-D SWE, ARFI imaging and transient elastography seem to be comparably good methods for non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis.",

The goal of this study was to assess the clinical use of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) evaluated by supersonic shear imaging (SSI), FibroScan, and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) in a cohort of NAFLD patients who underwent liver biopsy. A total of 291 NAFLD patients were prospectively enrolled from November 2011 to February 2015 at 2 French university hospitals. LSM was assessed by SSI, FibroScan (M probe), and ARFI within two weeks prior to liver biopsy. Calculations of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) were performed and compared for the staging of liver fibrosis. AUROC for SSI, FibroScan, and ARFI were 0.86, 0.82, and 0.77 for diagnoses of ≥F2; 0.89, 0.86, and 0.84 for ≥F3; and 0.88, 0.87, and 0.84 for F4, respectively. SSI had a higher accuracy than ARFI for diagnoses of significant fibrosis (≥F2) (P = 0.004). Clinical factors related to obesity such as body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2) , waist circumference ≥102 cm or increased parietal wall thickness were associated with LSM failures when using SSI or FibroScan and with unreliable results when using ARFI. In univariate analysis, FibroScan values were slightly correlated with NAFLD activity score and steatosis (R = 0.28 and 0.22, respectively), whereas SSI and ARFI were not; however, these components of NAFLD did not affect LSM results in multivariate analysis. The cutoff values for SSI and FibroScan for staging fibrosis with a sensitivity ≥90% were very close: 6.3/6.2 kPa for ≥F2, 8.3/8.2 kPa for ≥F3, and 10.5/9.5 kPa for F4.",

The purpose of this study was to perform an intra-individual comparison between 2-D shear wave elastography (2-D-SWE with a GE system) and Virtual Touch Tissue Quantification (VTTQ with a Siemens system) to assess whether these can be used interchangeably to grade fibrosis. Ninety-three patients (51 men, 42 women; mean age, 54 y) with liver disease of various etiologies (hepatitis B virus = 47, hepatitis C virus = 22; alcohol = 6, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis = 5, other = 13) were included. Using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values, liver fibrosis was classified into clinically non-significant (F0/F1) and significant (≥F2) fibrosis. Results indicated that intra-modality repeatability was excellent for both techniques (GE 2-D-SWE: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.89 [0.84-0.93]; VTTQ: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.90 [0.86-0.93]). Intra-modality classification agreement for fibrosis grading was good to excellent (GE 2-D-SWE: κ = 0.65, VTTQ: κ = 0.82). However, inter-modality agreement for fibrosis grading was only fair (κ = 0.31) using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values of fibrosis. In conclusion, although both GE 2-D-SWE and Siemens VTTQ exhibit good to excellent intra-modality repeatability, inter-modality agreement is only fair, suggesting that these should not be used interchangeably.",

Sequence-influenced methylations were described in T2DM-associated genomic regions, but evidence for direct, sequence-independent association with disease risk is missing. Here, we explore disease-contributing DNA methylation through a stepwise study design: first, a pool-based, genome-scale screen among 1169 case and control individuals revealed an excess of differentially methylated sites in genomic regions that were previously associated with T2DM through genetic studies. Next, in-depth analyses were performed at selected top-ranking regions. A CpG site in the first intron of the FTO gene showed small (3.35%) but significant (P = 0.000021) hypomethylation of cases relative to controls. The effect was independent of the sequence polymorphism in the region and persists among individuals carrying the sequence-risk alleles. The odds of belonging to the T2DM group increased by 6.1% for every 1% decrease in methylation (OR = 1.061, 95% CI: 1.032-1.090), the odds ratio for decrease of 1 standard deviation of methylation (adjusted to gender) was 1.5856 (95% CI: 1.2824-1.9606) and the sensitivity (area under the curve = 0.638, 95% CI: 0.586-0.690; males = 0.675, females = 0.609) was better than that of the strongest known sequence variant. Furthermore, a prospective study in an independent population cohort revealed significant hypomethylation of young individuals that later progressed to T2DM, relative to the individuals who stayed healthy. Further genomic analysis revealed co-localization with gene enhancers and with binding sites for methylation-sensitive transcriptional regulators. The data showed that low methylation level at the analyzed sites is an early marker of T2DM and suggests a novel mechanism by which early-onset, inter-individual methylation variation at isolated non-promoter genomic sites predisposes to T2DM.",
        "# Title: DNA methylation profiling identifies epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetic patients.\n# Abstract: In addition to genetic predisposition, environmental and lifestyle factors contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Epigenetic changes may provide the link for translating environmental exposures into pathological mechanisms. In this study, we performed the first comprehensive DNA methylation profiling in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We uncovered 276 CpG loci affiliated to promoters of 254 genes displaying significant differential DNA methylation in diabetic islets. These methylation changes were not present in blood cells from T2D individuals nor were they experimentally induced in non-diabetic islets by exposure to high glucose. For a subgroup of the differentially methylated genes, concordant transcriptional changes were present. Functional annotation of the aberrantly methylated genes and RNAi experiments highlighted pathways implicated in β-cell survival and function; some are implicated in cellular dysfunction while others facilitate adaptation to stressors. Together, our findings offer new insights into the intricate mechanisms of T2D pathogenesis, underscore the important involvement of epigenetic dysregulation in diabetic islets and may advance our understanding of T2D aetiology.",

        "# Title: Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of human pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic donors identifies candidate genes that influence insulin secretion.\n# Abstract: Impaired insulin secretion is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Epigenetics may affect disease susceptibility. To describe the human methylome in pancreatic islets and determine the epigenetic basis of T2D, we analyzed DNA methylation of 479,927 CpG sites and the transcriptome in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We provide a detailed map of the global DNA methylation pattern in human islets, β- and α-cells. Genomic regions close to the transcription start site showed low degrees of methylation and regions further away from the transcription start site such as the gene body, 3'UTR and intergenic regions showed a higher degree of methylation. While CpG islands were hypomethylated, the surrounding 2 kb shores showed an intermediate degree of methylation, whereas regions further away (shelves and open sea) were hypermethylated in human islets, β- and α-cells. We identified 1,649 CpG sites and 853 genes, including TCF7L2, FTO and KCNQ1, with differential DNA methylation in T2D islets after correction for multiple testing. The majority of the differentially methylated CpG sites had an intermediate degree of methylation and were underrepresented in CpG islands (∼ 7%) and overrepresented in the open sea (∼ 60%). 102 of the differentially methylated genes, including CDKN1A, PDE7B, SEPT9 and EXOC3L2, were differentially expressed in T2D islets. Methylation of CDKN1A and PDE7B promoters in vitro suppressed their transcriptional activity. Functional analyses demonstrated that identified candidate genes affect pancreatic β- and α-cells as Exoc3l silencing reduced exocytosis and overexpression of Cdkn1a, Pde7b and Sept9 perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion in clonal β- and α-cells, respectively. Together, our data can serve as a reference methylome in human islets. We provide new target genes with altered DNA methylation and expression in human T2D islets that contribute to perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion. These results highlight the importance of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of T2D.",
        "# Title: Altered DNA methylation and differential expression of genes influencing metabolism and inflammation in adipose tissue from subjects with type 2 diabetes.\n# Abstract: Genetics, epigenetics, and environment may together affect the susceptibility for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our aim was to dissect molecular mechanisms underlying T2D using genome-wide expression and DNA methylation data in adipose tissue from monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D and independent case-control cohorts. In adipose tissue from diabetic twins, we found decreased expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation; carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism; and increased expression of genes involved in inflammation and glycan degradation. The most differentially expressed genes included ELOVL6, GYS2, FADS1, SPP1 (OPN), CCL18, and IL1RN. We replicated these results in adipose tissue from an independent case-control cohort. Several candidate genes for obesity and T2D (e.g., IRS1 and VEGFA) were differentially expressed in discordant twins. We found a heritable contribution to the genome-wide DNA methylation variability in twins. Differences in methylation between monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D were subsequently modest. However, 15,627 sites, representing 7,046 genes including PPARG, KCNQ1, TCF7L2, and IRS1, showed differential DNA methylation in adipose tissue from unrelated subjects with T2D compared with control subjects. A total of 1,410 of these sites also showed differential DNA methylation in the twins discordant for T2D. For the differentially methylated sites, the heritability estimate was 0.28. We also identified copy number variants (CNVs) in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D. Taken together, subjects with T2D exhibit multiple transcriptional and epigenetic changes in adipose tissue relevant to the development of the disease.",
        "# Title: An integrated epigenomic analysis for type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci in monozygotic twins.\n# Abstract: DNA methylation has a great potential for understanding the aetiology of common complex traits such as Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here we perform genome-wide methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) in whole-blood-derived DNA from 27 monozygotic twin pairs and follow up results with replication and integrated omics analyses. We identify predominately hypermethylated T2D-related differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and replicate the top signals in 42 unrelated T2D cases and 221 controls. The strongest signal is in the promoter of the MALT1 gene, involved in insulin and glycaemic pathways, and related to taurocholate levels in blood. Integrating the DNA methylome findings with T2D GWAS meta-analysis results reveals a strong enrichment for DMRs in T2D-susceptibility loci. We also detect signals specific to T2D-discordant twins in the GPR61 and PRKCB genes. These replicated T2D associations reflect both likely causal and consequential pathways of the disease. The analysis indicates how an integrated genomics and epigenomics approach, utilizing an MZ twin design, can provide pathogenic insights as well as potential drug targets and biomarkers for T2D and other complex traits.",

In the setting of large, extended families representing a minority, high-risk population of the USA, we aimed to characterize the role of epigenome-wide DNA methylation in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Using Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays, we tested for association of DNA methylation at 446 356 sites with age, sex and phenotypic traits related to T2D in 850 pedigreed Mexican-American individuals. Robust statistical analyses showed that (i) 15% of the methylome is significantly heritable, with a median heritability of 0.14; (ii) DNA methylation at 14% of CpG sites is associated with nearby sequence variants; (iii) 22% and 3% of the autosomal CpG sites are associated with age and sex, respectively; (iv) 53 CpG sites were significantly associated with liability to T2D, fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance; (v) DNA methylation levels at five CpG sites, mapping to three well-characterized genes (TXNIP, ABCG1 and SAMD12) independently explained 7.8% of the heritability of T2D (vi) methylation at these five sites was unlikely to be influenced by neighboring DNA sequence variation. Our study has identified novel epigenetic indicators of T2D risk in Mexican Americans who have increased risk for this disease. These results provide new insights into potential treatment targets of T2D.",

        "# Title: Epigenome-wide association study identifies TXNIP gene associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and sustained hyperglycemia.\n# Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is an established risk factor for a wide range of vascular diseases, including ischemic stroke (IS). Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a marker for average blood glucose levels over the previous 12 weeks, is used as a measure of glycemic control and also as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes (HbA1c levels ≥ 6.5%). Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, may be associated with aging processes and with modulation of the risk of various pathologies, such as DM. Specifically, DNA methylation could be one of the mechanisms mediating the relation between DM and environmental exposures. Our goal was to identify new CpG methylation sites associated with DM. We performed a genome-wide methylation study in whole-blood DNA from an IS patient cohorts. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array was used to measure DNA methylation in CpG sites. All statistical analyses were adjusted for sex, age, hyperlipidemia, body mass index (BMI), smoking habit and cell count. Findings were replicated in two independent cohorts, an IS cohort and a population-based cohort, using the same array. In the discovery phase (N = 355), we identified a CpG site, cg19693031 (located in the TXNIP gene) that was associated with DM (P = 1.17 × 10(-12)); this CpG was replicated in two independent cohorts (N = 167 and N = 645). Methylation of TXNIP was inversely and intensely associated with HbA1c levels (P = 7.3 × 10(-16)), specifically related to diabetic patients with poor control of glucose levels. We identified an association between the TXNIP gene and DM through epigenetic mechanisms, related to sustained hyperglycemia levels (HbA1c ≥ 7%).",

Here we examine whether age-related epigenetic changes affect human islet function and if blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect these changes and associate with future T2D. We analyse DNA methylation genome-wide in islets from 87 non-diabetic donors, aged 26-74 years. Aging associates with increased DNA methylation of 241 sites. These sites cover loci previously associated with T2D, for example, KLF14. Blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related methylation changes in 83 genes identified in human islets (for example, KLF14, FHL2, ZNF518B and FAM123C) and some associate with insulin secretion and T2D. DNA methylation correlates with islet expression of multiple genes, including FHL2, ZNF518B, GNPNAT1 and HLTF. Silencing these genes in β-cells alter insulin secretion. Together, we demonstrate that blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related DNA methylation changes in human islets, and associate with insulin secretion in vivo and T2D.",

To conduct a genome-wide DNA methylation in individuals with type 2 diabetes, individuals with prediabetes, and control mixed ancestry individuals from South Africa. Methods. We used peripheral blood to perform genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in 3 individuals with screen detected diabetes, 3 individuals with prediabetes, and 3 individuals with normoglycaemia from the Bellville South Community, Cape Town, South Africa, who were age-, gender-, body mass index-, and duration of residency-matched. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) was performed by Arraystar Inc. (Rockville, MD, USA). Results. Hypermethylated DMRs were 1160 (81.97%) and 124 (43.20%), respectively, in individuals with diabetes and prediabetes when both were compared to subjects with normoglycaemia. Our data shows that genes related to the immune system, signal transduction, glucose transport, and pancreas development have altered DNA methylation in subjects with prediabetes and diabetes. Pathway analysis based on the functional analysis mapping of genes to KEGG pathways suggested that the linoleic acid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism pathways are hypomethylated in prediabetes and diabetes. Conclusions. Our study suggests that epigenetic changes are likely to be an early process that occurs before the onset of overt diabetes. Detailed analysis of DMRs that shows gradual methylation differences from control versus prediabetes to prediabetes versus diabetes in a larger sample size is required to confirm these findings.",
        "# Title: Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing of Human Pancreatic Islets Reveals Novel Differentially Methylated Regions in Type 2 Diabetes Pathogenesis.\n# Abstract: Current knowledge about the role of epigenetics in type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains limited. Only a few studies have investigated DNA methylation of selected candidate genes or a very small fraction of genomic CpG sites in human pancreatic islets, the tissue of primary pathogenic importance for diabetes. Our aim was to characterize the whole-genome DNA methylation landscape in human pancreatic islets, to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in diabetic islets, and to investigate the function of DMRs in islet biology. Here, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, which is a comprehensive and unbiased method to study DNA methylation throughout the genome at a single nucleotide resolution, in pancreatic islets from donors with T2D and control subjects without diabetes. We identified 25,820 DMRs in islets from individuals with T2D. These DMRs cover loci with known islet function, e.g., PDX1, TCF7L2, and ADCY5 Importantly, binding sites previously identified by ChIP-seq for islet-specific transcription factors, enhancer regions, and different histone marks were enriched in the T2D-associated DMRs. We also identified 457 genes, including NR4A3, PARK2, PID1, SLC2A2, and SOCS2, that had both DMRs and significant expression changes in T2D islets. To mimic the situation in T2D islets, candidate genes were overexpressed or silenced in cultured β-cells. This resulted in impaired insulin secretion, thereby connecting differential methylation to islet dysfunction. We further explored the islet methylome and found a strong link between methylation levels and histone marks. Additionally, DNA methylation in different genomic regions and of different transcript types (i.e., protein coding, noncoding, and pseudogenes) was associated with islet expression levels. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the islet DNA methylome in individuals with and without diabetes and highlights the importance of epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets and T2D pathogenesis."

Twenty children on dialysis intended to perform a 12-week graded community-based exercise program. Exercise capacity and fatigue level were studied; muscle force and health-related quality of life were secondary outcomes. All outcomes were measured at baseline (T = 0) and after intervention (T = 1). Fourteen of the 20 patients (70%) either did not start the program or did not complete the program. Of these patients, seven did not complete or even start the exercise program because of a combination of lack of time and motivational problems. Six patients were not able to continue the program or were unable to do the follow-up measurements because of medical problems. Exercise capacity and muscle strength was higher after the exercise program in the children who completed the training. In conclusion, exercise training is difficult to perform in children with ESRD and is not always feasible in real-life situations for many children with ESRD.",

The aim of this study was to determine if twice-weekly exercise for 1 h during HD could improve exercise capacity in children receiving HD. We assessed lower extremity strength (Biodex; dominant extension peak torque in 60 degrees per second, Newton-meters), grip strength (dynanometer, kilogram) and 6-min walk capacity (yards) in ten children (median age 13.6 years, range 8-25 years) at baseline and after 3 months of twice weekly exercise for 1 h during HD. Baseline assessment revealed a mean (1) Biodex of 70 +/- 32 N-m/s, (2) 6-m walk test of 589 +/- 90 yards and (3) grip strength of 23.2 +/- 10 kg, which were 50% lower than the normal value for healthy controls. Patients demonstrated significant improvements in lower extremity strength and 6-min walk test after 3 months of exercise. Our data show that twice-weekly exercise of a moderate intensity during HD can lead to exercise capacity improvement in 3 months. We identified barriers to and strategies for the successful implementation of intradialytic exercise. We suggest that intradialytic exercise intervention may be effective to improve exercise capacity in children receiving maintenance HD.",

Aerobic, strengthening exercises, and exergames are reported as effective in the treatment of symptoms associated with CKD. Unlike adult patients, there are insufficient studies investigating the effects of exercise on disease-related symptoms in pediatric CKD. This study aimed to compare the effects of Nintendo Wii-based exergaming and home-based fun video exercises on functional capacity, muscle strength, physical activity (PA), depression, fatigue, and QoL in pediatric patients with CKD. Twenty-three pediatric patients with CKD were included in the study and randomized to group I (Nintendo Wii Fit) and group II (home-based fun video exercises). Patients in both groups underwent exercise programs twice per week for 6 weeks. Functional capacity, muscle strength, PA, QoL, fatigue, and depression of the patients were evaluated before and after the treatments. Sixteen patients completed the study. After treatment, significant differences were observed in both groups on 6MWT, muscle strength, average daily steps, PedsQoL Child Self-Report PHSS, and the Visual Fatigue Scale. Left knee flexor muscle strength and average step counts were found to be superior in group I. Both exergaming and home-based fun video exercises provide positive effects on functional capacity, muscle strength, fatigue, PA, depression, and QoL in pediatric patients with CKD. We think that these exercise methods can help to protect physical and mental health of patients and should be included in treatment from the early stages of the disease."

This study presents a summary of current understanding regarding the clonal relatedness of mutated genes in primary cutaneous melanoma and matched tumors. We draw attention to the knowledge gap regarding the genetic heterogeneity of melanoma-specific genes, which could serve as a valuable tool in identifying suitable patients for trials testing possible new targeted therapies. Furthermore, we found that CM presents a significant concordance in BRAF status between primary and metastatic tumors than in previous meta-analyses, probably due to technical advances, although a minority of patients showed inconsistencies. Therefore, we propose that molecular testing in metastatic tissue is a more appropriate method for determining BRAF status to tailor the treatment decision, although it is still reasonable to use the primary tumor in cases of difficulty. Further research should investigate the factors causing these discrepancies and the feasibility of using other molecular markers with BRAF status to better stratify patients for melanoma treatment.",

With the emergence of BRAF(V600E) as a therapeutic target, we investigated intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity in melanoma using detection of the BRAF(V600E) mutation as a marker of clonality. BRAF mutant-specific PCR (MS-PCR) and conventional sequencing were performed on 112 tumors from 73 patients, including patients with matched primary and metastatic specimens (n = 18). Nineteen patients had tissues available from multiple metastatic sites. Mutations were detected in 36/112 (32%) melanomas using conventional sequencing, and 85/112 (76%) using MS-PCR. The better sensitivity of the MS-PCR to detect the mutant BRAF(V600E) allele was not due to the presence of contaminating normal tissue, suggesting that the tumor was comprised of subclones of differing BRAF genotypes. To determine if tumor subclones were present in individual primary melanomas, we performed laser microdissection and mutation detection via sequencing and BRAF(V600E)-specific SNaPshot analysis in 9 cases. Six of these cases demonstrated differing proportions of BRAF(V600E)and BRAF(wild-type) cells in distinct microdissected regions within individual tumors. Additional analyses of multiple metastatic samples from individual patients using the highly sensitive MS-PCR without microdissection revealed that 5/19 (26%) patients had metastases that were discordant for the BRAF(V600E) mutation. In conclusion, we used highly sensitive BRAF mutation detection methods and observed substantial evidence for heterogeneity of the BRAF(V600E) mutation within individual melanoma tumor specimens, and among multiple specimens from individual patients. Given the varied clinical responses of patients to BRAF inhibitor therapy, these data suggest that additional studies to determine possible associations between clinical outcomes and intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity could prove fruitful.",

Patients with BRAF mutation-negative primary tumors may manifest BRAF mutation-positive metastatic disease. It is unclear whether all metastatic lesions carry the same BRAF mutation status found in the primary tumor and if discordancy exists, in what frequency it occurs. Primary and matched metastatic lesions in 25 melanoma patients were tested for the BRAF V600E/Ec, V600K, V600D, and V600R mutations using a BRAF RGQ PCR kit (Qiagen). Four patients (16%) had discrepancies between their primary and metastatic melanoma BRAF status. Of these patients, 2 (8%) had BRAF mutation-positive primary melanomas with BRAF mutation-negative metastatic lesions and 2 (8%) patient had BRAF mutation-negative melanoma with a BRAF mutation-positive metastatic lesion. In summary, discordancy of BRAF mutation status is not an infrequent finding between primary and metastatic melanoma.

Nevertheless, BRAF oncogene mutation status between different samples from the same patient has been studied with conflicting results. This study investigated the intrapatient homogeneity of BRAF mutation status using pyrosequencing in primary tumors and different metastatic sites of melanoma patients. Paired samples of lymphatic, visceral, and subcutaneous metastases and primary melanoma from 45 metastatic melanoma patients were tested for BRAF mutations using a pyrosequencing assay and by Sanger sequencing. Overall, sequencing for BRAF mutation status was performed in 114 paired samples from 45 patients. Eighteen patients (40%) carried a BRAF mutation, including BRAF V600E (12/18), BRAF V600K (5/18), and BRAF V600R (1/18) mutations. Multiple BRAF mutations (V600E and V600K) were found in one patient. Among the patients with BRAF mutations, a good agreement in BRAF mutation status was found between the first and second tumor samples genotyped (91%; Cohen's κ coefficient: 0.81). Discordance in BRAF mutation status was found only in four patients, involving all three patients in whom sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases were sampled. These SLNs exhibited a wild-type genotype and were discordant with the other BRAF-mutated samples found in the same patient. The intrapatient BRAF status was predominantly homogeneous. However, SLN genotyping using pyrosequencing might be inaccurate in determining the actual mutation status of melanoma. Further studies are required to confirm the lack of reliability of SLN.",

Given this, the objective of the current study was to ascertain concordance of somatic mutations in BRAF/NRAS/TERT and immunohistochemical PD-L1 and CD8 in matched primary cutaneous and metastatic melanoma. A total of 43 archival paired samples with sufficient material for genetic and immunohistochemical analyses met the criteria for inclusion in the study. Immunohistochemistry was performed for PD-L1 and CD8 and direct-DNA Sanger sequencing for BRAF/NRAS/TERT promoter mutational analyses. Agreement between paired samples was assessed using Cohen κ. Poor concordance among primary and corresponding metastases was noted in BRAF (9/42 cases discordant, κ = 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.77; P = .0013), TERT promoter mutations (13/41 cases discordant, κ = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.04-0.62; P = .033), tumoral PD-L1 immunoexpression (9/43 cases discordant, κ = 0.39; 95% CI, 0.07-0.72; P = .0099), and immunoexpression of CD8+ T lymphocytes (12/43 cases discordant, κ = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.19-0.69; P = .002). Although NRAS1 and NRAS2 were highly concordant (42/43 and 39/43 cases, respectively), discordant NRAS2 mutational status was associated with a median time to metastasis of 90 versus 455 days for pairs with concordant status (P = .07).

        "# Title: Immunohistochemical and Molecular Features of Melanomas Exhibiting Intratumor and Intertumor Histomorphologic Heterogeneity.\n# Abstract: Melanoma is a heterogeneous neoplasm at the histomorphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular levels. Melanoma with extreme histomorphologic heterogeneity can pose a diagnostic challenge in which the diagnosis may predominantly rely on its immunophenotypic profile. However, tumor survival and response to therapy are linked to tumor genetic heterogeneity rather than tumor morphology. Therefore, understating the molecular characteristics of such melanomas become indispensable. In this study, DNA was extracted from 11 morphologically distinct regions in eight formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded melanomas. In each region, mutations in 50 cancer-related genes were tested using next-generation sequencing (NGS). A tumor was considered genetically heterogeneous if at least one non-overlapping mutation was identified either between the histologically distinct regions of the same tumor (intratumor heterogeneity) or among the histologically distinct regions of the paired primary and metastatic tumors within the same patient (intertumor heterogeneity). Our results revealed that genetic heterogeneity existed in all tumors as non-overlapping mutations were detected in every tested tumor (n = 5, 100%; intratumor: n = 2, 40%; intertumor: n = 3, 60%). Conversely, overlapping mutations were also detected in all the tested regions (n = 11, 100%). Melanomas exhibiting histomorphologic heterogeneity are often associated with genetic heterogeneity, which might contribute to tumor survival and poor response to therapy.",

Intra-patient heterogeneity was detected in 13.3% of patients for both BRAF and NRAS genes and was not associated with clinico-pathological characteristics of melanomas or metastases. High consistency was observed between immunostaining and molecular methods for BRAFV600E (k = 0.90; p < 0.001) and NRASQ61R (k = 0.87; p < 0.001).

As the potential heterogeneity of BRAF mutations in melanoma has been reported, accurate detection of BRAF mutations are important. However, the genetic heterogeneity of acral melanoma-a distinct type of melanoma with a unique genetic background-has not fully been investigated. We conducted a retrospective review of our acral melanoma patients. Of the 196 patients with acral melanoma, we retrieved 31 pairs of primary and matched metastatic melanomas. We immunostained the 31 pairs with VE1, a BRAFV600E-mutation-specific monoclonal antibody. Immunohistochemistry with VE1 showed a high degree of sensitivity and specificity for detecting BRAFV600E mutations compared with the real-time polymerase chain reaction method. A total of nine primary (29.0%) and eight metastatic (25.8%) acral melanomas were positive for VE1. In three patients (9.7%), we observed a discordance of VE1 staining between the primary and metastatic lesions. Of note, VE1 immunohistochemical staining revealed a remarkable degree of intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity in acral melanoma. Our study reveals that VE1 immunostaining is a useful ancillary method for detecting BRAFV600E mutations in acral melanoma and allows for a clear visualization of intra- and inter-tumor BRAF heterogeneity.",

In melanoma, the frequencies of intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity are controversial. We examined mutational heterogeneity within individual patients with melanoma using multiplatform analysis of commonly mutated driver and nonpassenger genes. We analyzed paired primary and metastatic tumors from 60 patients and multiple metastatic tumors from 39 patients whose primary tumors were unavailable (n = 271 tumors). We used a combination of multiplex SNaPshot assays, Sanger sequencing, mutation-specific PCR, or droplet digital PCR to determine the presence of BRAFV600, NRASQ61, TERT-124C>T, and TERT-146C>T mutations. Mutations were detected in BRAF (39%), NRAS (21%), and/or TERT (78%). Thirteen patients had TERTmutant discordant tumors; seven of these had a single tumor with both TERT-124C>T and TERT-146C>T mutations present at different allele frequencies. Two patients had both BRAF and NRAS mutations; one had different tumors and the other had a single tumor with both mutations. One patient with a BRAFmutant primary lacked mutant BRAF in at least one of their metastases. Overall, we identified mutational heterogeneity in 18 of 99 patients (18%). These results suggest that some primary melanomas may be composed of subclones with differing mutational profiles. Such heterogeneity may be relevant to treatment responses and survival outcomes."

        "conclusionB": "Based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of multiple studies, **BRAF mutation status exhibits significant heterogeneity between primary and metastatic melanoma lesions in a substantial proportion of patients (ranging from 13% to 40% discordance across studies), with discordancy rates reported between 8% and 16% in specific cohorts.** This inter-tumor heterogeneity may occur even when primary tumors appear homogeneous and has implications for targeted therapy, potentially requiring re-evaluation of BRAF status in metastatic sites, particularly in patients initially testing negative. While generally observed as homogeneous, evidence of intra-tumor heterogeneity within individual primary or metastatic lesions has also been documented, suggesting the presence of subclones with differing BRAF genotypes."

      "referenceConclusion": "The complete explanation of the genomic background behind melanoma pathogenesis remains elusive. This study presents a summary of current understanding regarding the clonal relatedness of mutated genes in primary cutaneous melanoma and matched tumors. We draw attention to the knowledge gap regarding the genetic heterogeneity of melanoma-specific genes, which could serve as a valuable tool in identifying suitable patients for trials testing possible new targeted therapies. Furthermore, we found that CM presents a significant concordance in BRAF status between primary and metastatic tumors than in previous meta-analyses, probably due to technical advances, although a minority of patients showed inconsistencies. Therefore, we propose that molecular testing in metastatic tissue is a more appropriate method for determining BRAF status to tailor the treatment decision, although it is still reasonable to use the primary tumor in cases of difficulty. Further research should investigate the factors causing these discrepancies and the feasibility of using other molecular markers with BRAF status to better stratify patients for melanoma treatment.",

        "# Title: Intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity of BRAF(V600E))mutations in primary and metastatic melanoma.\n# Abstract: The rationale for using small molecule inhibitors of oncogenic proteins as cancer therapies depends, at least in part, on the assumption that metastatic tumors are primarily clonal with respect to mutant oncogene. With the emergence of BRAF(V600E) as a therapeutic target, we investigated intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity in melanoma using detection of the BRAF(V600E) mutation as a marker of clonality. BRAF mutant-specific PCR (MS-PCR) and conventional sequencing were performed on 112 tumors from 73 patients, including patients with matched primary and metastatic specimens (n = 18). Nineteen patients had tissues available from multiple metastatic sites. Mutations were detected in 36/112 (32%) melanomas using conventional sequencing, and 85/112 (76%) using MS-PCR. The better sensitivity of the MS-PCR to detect the mutant BRAF(V600E) allele was not due to the presence of contaminating normal tissue, suggesting that the tumor was comprised of subclones of differing BRAF genotypes. To determine if tumor subclones were present in individual primary melanomas, we performed laser microdissection and mutation detection via sequencing and BRAF(V600E)-specific SNaPshot analysis in 9 cases. Six of these cases demonstrated differing proportions of BRAF(V600E)and BRAF(wild-type) cells in distinct microdissected regions within individual tumors. Additional analyses of multiple metastatic samples from individual patients using the highly sensitive MS-PCR without microdissection revealed that 5/19 (26%) patients had metastases that were discordant for the BRAF(V600E) mutation. In conclusion, we used highly sensitive BRAF mutation detection methods and observed substantial evidence for heterogeneity of the BRAF(V600E) mutation within individual melanoma tumor specimens, and among multiple specimens from individual patients. Given the varied clinical responses of patients to BRAF inhibitor therapy, these data suggest that additional studies to determine possible associations between clinical outcomes and intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity could prove fruitful.",

Patients with BRAF mutation-negative primary tumors may manifest BRAF mutation-positive metastatic disease. It is unclear whether all metastatic lesions carry the same BRAF mutation status found in the primary tumor and if discordancy exists, in what frequency it occurs. Primary and matched metastatic lesions in 25 melanoma patients were tested for the BRAF V600E/Ec, V600K, V600D, and V600R mutations using a BRAF RGQ PCR kit (Qiagen). Four patients (16%) had discrepancies between their primary and metastatic melanoma BRAF status. Of these patients, 2 (8%) had BRAF mutation-positive primary melanomas with BRAF mutation-negative metastatic lesions and 2 (8%) patient had BRAF mutation-negative melanoma with a BRAF mutation-positive metastatic lesion. In summary, discordancy of BRAF mutation status is not an infrequent finding between primary and metastatic melanoma.

Median survival was 9 months. The median Breslow thickness for the primary lesion was 3.4 mm. Six patients (14%) had discrepancy between the BRAF status of a melanoma primary and metastatic lesion. Of these 6 patients, 3 had a BRAF mutation positive primary with a BRAF mutation negative metastatic lesion, while the other 3 had a BRAF mutation negative primary with BRAF mutation positive metastasis.There is an important discordance rate in the BRAF mutation status of melanoma primaries versus brain metastases.",
        "# Title: Concordance of somatic mutation profiles (BRAF,NRAS, and TERT) and tumoral PD-L1 in matched primary cutaneous and metastatic melanoma samples.\n# Abstract: Despite the efficacy of BRAF-targeted and PD-L1-related immune therapies in tackling metastatic melanoma, a significant number of patients exhibit resistance. Given this, the objective of the current study was to ascertain concordance of somatic mutations in BRAF/NRAS/TERT and immunohistochemical PD-L1 and CD8 in matched primary cutaneous and metastatic melanoma. A total of 43 archival paired samples with sufficient material for genetic and immunohistochemical analyses met the criteria for inclusion in the study. Immunohistochemistry was performed for PD-L1 and CD8 and direct-DNA Sanger sequencing for BRAF/NRAS/TERT promoter mutational analyses. Agreement between paired samples was assessed using Cohen κ. Poor concordance among primary and corresponding metastases was noted in BRAF (9/42 cases discordant, κ = 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.77; P = .0013), TERT promoter mutations (13/41 cases discordant, κ = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.04-0.62; P = .033), tumoral PD-L1 immunoexpression (9/43 cases discordant, κ = 0.39; 95% CI, 0.07-0.72; P = .0099), and immunoexpression of CD8+ T lymphocytes (12/43 cases discordant, κ = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.19-0.69; P = .002). Although NRAS1 and NRAS2 were highly concordant (42/43 and 39/43 cases, respectively), discordant NRAS2 mutational status was associated with a median time to metastasis of 90 versus 455 days for pairs with concordant status (P = .07). Although limited by sample size, our findings suggest that consideration be given to mutational analysis of metastatic tissue rather than the primary to guide BRAF-targeted therapy and question the roles of TERT promoter mutations and PD-L1 as predictive biomarkers in malignant melanoma.",

        "# Title: Immunohistochemical and Molecular Features of Melanomas Exhibiting Intratumor and Intertumor Histomorphologic Heterogeneity.\n# Abstract: Melanoma is a heterogeneous neoplasm at the histomorphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular levels. Melanoma with extreme histomorphologic heterogeneity can pose a diagnostic challenge in which the diagnosis may predominantly rely on its immunophenotypic profile. However, tumor survival and response to therapy are linked to tumor genetic heterogeneity rather than tumor morphology. Therefore, understating the molecular characteristics of such melanomas become indispensable. In this study, DNA was extracted from 11 morphologically distinct regions in eight formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded melanomas. In each region, mutations in 50 cancer-related genes were tested using next-generation sequencing (NGS). A tumor was considered genetically heterogeneous if at least one non-overlapping mutation was identified either between the histologically distinct regions of the same tumor (intratumor heterogeneity) or among the histologically distinct regions of the paired primary and metastatic tumors within the same patient (intertumor heterogeneity). Our results revealed that genetic heterogeneity existed in all tumors as non-overlapping mutations were detected in every tested tumor (n = 5, 100%; intratumor: n = 2, 40%; intertumor: n = 3, 60%). Conversely, overlapping mutations were also detected in all the tested regions (n = 11, 100%). Melanomas exhibiting histomorphologic heterogeneity are often associated with genetic heterogeneity, which might contribute to tumor survival and poor response to therapy.",
        "# Title: Intra-patient Heterogeneity of BRAF and NRAS Molecular Alterations in Primary Melanoma and Metastases.\n# Abstract: Mutations in MAPK signalling genes are driver events in melanoma, and have therapeutic relevance in the metastatic and adjuvant setting. This study evaluated the intra-patient heterogeneity of BRAF, NRAS and c-KIT mutational status between 30 primary melanomas and 39 related metastases, using molecular analysis and immunohistochemistry. BRAF mutations were identified in 46.7% of primary melanomas and 48.7% of metastases and NRAS mutations in 20% and 25.6%, respectively. Intra-patient heterogeneity was detected in 13.3% of patients for both BRAF and NRAS genes and was not associated with clinico-pathological characteristics of melanomas or metastases. High consistency was observed between immunostaining and molecular methods for BRAFV600E (k = 0.90; p < 0.001) and NRASQ61R (k = 0.87; p < 0.001). These findings demonstrate a relevant intra-patient heterogeneity between primary and metastatic lesions that is independent of clinical variables and methodological approach.",
        "# Title: Intra- and Inter-Tumor BRAF Heterogeneity in Acral Melanoma: An Immunohistochemical Analysis.\n# Abstract: The current development of BRAF inhibitors has revolutionized the treatment of unresectable melanoma. As the potential heterogeneity of BRAF mutations in melanoma has been reported, accurate detection of BRAF mutations are important. However, the genetic heterogeneity of acral melanoma-a distinct type of melanoma with a unique genetic background-has not fully been investigated. We conducted a retrospective review of our acral melanoma patients. Of the 196 patients with acral melanoma, we retrieved 31 pairs of primary and matched metastatic melanomas. We immunostained the 31 pairs with VE1, a BRAFV600E-mutation-specific monoclonal antibody. Immunohistochemistry with VE1 showed a high degree of sensitivity and specificity for detecting BRAFV600E mutations compared with the real-time polymerase chain reaction method. A total of nine primary (29.0%) and eight metastatic (25.8%) acral melanomas were positive for VE1. In three patients (9.7%), we observed a discordance of VE1 staining between the primary and metastatic lesions. Of note, VE1 immunohistochemical staining revealed a remarkable degree of intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity in acral melanoma. Our study reveals that VE1 immunostaining is a useful ancillary method for detecting BRAFV600E mutations in acral melanoma and allows for a clear visualization of intra- and inter-tumor BRAF heterogeneity.",
        "# Title: TERT, BRAF, and NRAS Mutational Heterogeneity between Paired Primary and Metastatic Melanoma Tumors.\n# Abstract: Mutational heterogeneity can contribute to therapeutic resistance in solid cancers. In melanoma, the frequencies of intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity are controversial. We examined mutational heterogeneity within individual patients with melanoma using multiplatform analysis of commonly mutated driver and nonpassenger genes. We analyzed paired primary and metastatic tumors from 60 patients and multiple metastatic tumors from 39 patients whose primary tumors were unavailable (n = 271 tumors). We used a combination of multiplex SNaPshot assays, Sanger sequencing, mutation-specific PCR, or droplet digital PCR to determine the presence of BRAFV600, NRASQ61, TERT-124C>T, and TERT-146C>T mutations. Mutations were detected in BRAF (39%), NRAS (21%), and/or TERT (78%). Thirteen patients had TERTmutant discordant tumors; seven of these had a single tumor with both TERT-124C>T and TERT-146C>T mutations present at different allele frequencies. Two patients had both BRAF and NRAS mutations; one had different tumors and the other had a single tumor with both mutations. One patient with a BRAFmutant primary lacked mutant BRAF in at least one of their metastases. Overall, we identified mutational heterogeneity in 18 of 99 patients (18%). These results suggest that some primary melanomas may be composed of subclones with differing mutational profiles. Such heterogeneity may be relevant to treatment responses and survival outcomes."

        "conclusionA": "Genetic concordance between primary cutaneous melanoma and its metastases is a complex phenomenon significantly impacting treatment response: **while initial concordance, particularly in tumor mutational burden (TMB), correlates with improved outcomes for both targeted BRAF/MEK inhibition and immunotherapy, discordance – often driven by the emergence of resistance mutations or loss of heterozygosity – frequently predicts diminished treatment efficacy and can be dynamically monitored using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to inform adaptive therapeutic strategies.**",
        "conclusionB": "Despite generally high concordance, significant discordance in BRAF mutation status—occurring in 8% to 40% of patients depending on the study and methodology—is observed between primary melanomas and their metastases, highlighting the potential for inaccurate treatment allocation and the need to re-evaluate mutation status in metastatic disease, particularly when initial testing was negative or when response to BRAF inhibitor therapy is suboptimal."

Our approach in vaccine development uses recombinant expression of the highly immunogenic HAV antigen VP1-P2a in food-grade lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis and in Escherichia coli. We used genetic constructs that enable nisin-controlled expression of the antigen in L. lactis in three different forms: (a) intracellularly, (b) on the bacterial surface and (c) on the bacterial surface fused with the fragment of the E. coli flagellin molecule that can act as a molecular adjuvant. Expression of the two surface forms of the antigen was achieved in L. lactis, and the resulting antigen-displaying bacteria were administered orally to mice. Half the animals in each of the two groups developed specific IgGs, with titers increasing over time and reaching 1:422 without flagellin and 1:320 with flagellin. A much higher titer 1:25,803 was observed with the parenterally administered antigen, which was purified from E. coli. With the latter, a significant mucosal IgA response was also observed. Despite significant titers, the IgGs elicited with oral or parenteral administration could not prevent HAV from infecting cells in a virus neutralization assay, suggesting that the antibodies cannot recognize viral surface epitopes. Nevertheless, orally administered HAV antigen expressed in L. lactis elicited significant systemic humoral immune response showing the feasibility for development of effective HAV vaccine for mucosal delivery.",
        "# Title: Oral immunization with recombinant Lactococcus lactis delivering a multi-epitope antigen CTB-UE attenuates Helicobacter pylori infection in mice.\n# Abstract: Urease is an essential virulence factor and colonization factor for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and is considered as an excellent vaccine candidate antigen. However, conventional technologies for preparing an injectable vaccine require purification of the antigenic protein and preparation of an adjuvant. Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 (L. lactis) could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of edible vaccine. In previous study, we constructed a multi-epitope vaccine, designated CTB-UE, which is composed of the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), three Th cell epitopes and two B-cell epitopes from urease subunits. To develop a novel type of oral vaccine against H. pylori, genetically modified L. lactis strains were established to secrete this epitope vaccine extracellularly in this study. Oral prophylactic immunization with recombinant L. lactis significantly elicited humoral anti-urease antibody responses (P < 0.001) and reduced the gastric colonization of H. pylori from 7.14 ± 0.95 to 4.68 ± 0.98 log10 CFU g(-1) stomach. This L. lactis oral vaccine offers a promising vaccine candidate for the control of H. pylori infection.",
        "# Title: Development of a new DNA vaccine based on mycobacterial ESAT-6 antigen delivered by recombinant invasive Lactococcus lactis FnBPA+.\n# Abstract: The use of the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis as a vehicle for the oral delivery of DNA vaccine plasmids constitutes a promising strategy for vaccination. The delivery of DNA plasmids into eukaryotic cells is of critical importance for subsequent DNA expression and effectiveness of the vaccine. In this context, the use of the recombinant invasive L. lactis FnBPA+ (fibronectin-binding protein A) strain for the oral delivery of the eukaryotic expression vector vaccination using lactic acid bacteria (pValac), coding for the 6-kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6) gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, could represent a new DNA vaccine strategy against tuberculosis. To this end, the ESAT-6 sequence was cloned into the pValac vector; the L. lactis fibronectin-binding protein A (FnBPA)+ (pValac:ESAT-6) strain was obtained, and its immunological profile was checked in BALB/c mice. This strain was able to significantly increase interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production in spleen cells, showing a systemic T helper 1 (Th1) cell response. The mice also showed a significant increase in specific secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) production in colon tissue and fecal extracts. Thus, this is the first time that L. lactis has been used to deliver a plasmid DNA harboring a gene that encodes an antigen against tuberculosis through mucous membranes.",
        "# Title: Lactococcus lactis displayed neuraminidase confers cross protective immunity against influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Influenza A viruses pose a serious threat to public health. Current influenza A vaccines predominantly focus on hemagglutinin (HA) and show strain-specific protection. Neuraminidase (NA) is much less studied in the context of humoral immunity against influenza A viruses. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cross protective immunity of NA presented on Lactococcus lactis (L.lactis) surface against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in the mouse model. L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA was constructed in which pgsA was used as an anchor protein. Mice vaccinated orally with L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA could elicit significant NA-specific serum IgG and mucosa IgA antibodies, as well as neuraminidase inhibition (NI) titers. Importantly, L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA provided 80% protection against H5N1, 60% protection against H3N2 and H1N1, respectively. These findings suggest that recombinant L.lactis/pNZ110-pgsA-NA in the absence of adjuvant via oral administration can be served as an effective vaccine candidate against diverse strains of influenza A viruses.",
        "# Title: Broadly protective immunity against divergent influenza viruses by oral co-administration of Lactococcus lactis expressing nucleoprotein adjuvanted with cholera toxin B subunit in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines need to be annually reformulated to well match the predicated circulating strains. Thus, it is critical for developing a novel universal influenza vaccine that would be able to confer cross-protection against constantly emerging divergent influenza virus strains. Influenza virus A is a genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses. Influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) is a structural protein which encapsidates the negative strand viral RNA, and anti-NP antibodies play role in cross-protective immunity. Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) is an ideal vaccine delivery vehicle via oral administration route. However, L. lactis vectored vaccine exhibits poor immunogenicity without the use of mucosal adjuvant. To enhance the immunogenicity of L. lactis vectored vaccine, cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit, one of mucosal adjuvants, is a safe adjuvant for oral route, when combined with L. lactis vectored vaccine. In this study, we hypothesized that pNZ8008, a L. lactis expression plasmid, encoding NP antigen, would be able to elicit cross-protection with the use of CTB via oral administration route.",
        "# Title: Cross-protection of Lactococcus lactis-displayed HA2 subunit against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines provide strain-specific protection against homologous subtypes and need to be updated annually. Therefore, it is essential to develop a universal vaccine that would induce broadly cross-protective immunity against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses. The highly conserved HA2 subunit is a promising candidate for developing a universal influenza vaccine. Here, we hypothesized that the HA2 subunit could be displayed on the surface of Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis), using Spax as an anchor protein (L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2) and that L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 would have immunogenicity by oral administration without the use of adjuvant in the mouse model. To address this hypothesis, we show that oral vaccination of mice with L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 elicited significant humoral and mucosal immune responses. Importantly, L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 provided 100% protection against homologous H5N1 or heterologous H1N1 virus challenge. These results suggest that an HA2 subunit presented on the surface of L. lactis is an effective universal vaccine candidate against influenza A viruses in the poultry industry and in humans.",

Most of the current HIV vaccines under development use the i.m. route for immunization, which is relatively poor in generating potent and long-lived mucosal immune responses. In this article, we explore the ability of an oral vaccination with a probiotic organism, Lactococcus lactis, to elicit HIV-specific immune responses in the mucosal and systemic compartments of BALB/c mice. We expressed the HIV-1 Gag-p24 on the tip of the T3 pilus of Streptococcus pyogenes as a fusion to the Cpa protein (LL-Gag). After four monthly LL-Gag oral immunizations, we observed strong Gag-specific IgG and IgA responses in serum, feces, and vaginal secretions. However, the Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses in the blood were at or below our detection limit. After an i.m. modified vaccinia Ankara/Gag boost, we observed robust Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses both in systemic and in mucosal tissues, including intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes of the small intestine, Peyer's patches, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Consistent with strong immunogenicity, the LL-Gag induced activation of CD11c(+) CD11b(+) dendritic cells in the Peyer's patches after oral immunization. Our results demonstrate that oral immunization with L. lactis expressing an Ag on the tip of the group A Streptococcus pilus serves as an excellent vaccine platform to induce strong mucosal humoral and cellular immunity against HIV.",

        "# Title: Production and delivery of Helicobacter pylori NapA in Lactococcus lactis and its protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity.\n# Abstract: Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein A subunit (NapA) has been identified as a virulence factor, a protective antigen and a potent immunomodulator. NapA shows unique application potentials for anti-H. pylori vaccines and treatment strategies of certain allergic diseases and carcinomas. However, appropriate production and utilization modes of NapA still remain uncertain to date. This work has established a novel efficient production and utilization mode of NapA by using L. lactis as an expression host and delivery vector, and demonstrated immune protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity of the engineered L. lactis by oral vaccination of mice. It was observed for the first time that H. pylori NapA promotes both polarized Th17 and Th1 responses, which may greatly affect the clinical application of NapA. This report offers a promising anti-H. pylori oral vaccine candidate and a potent mucosal immune modulatory agent. Meanwhile, it uncovers a way to produce and deliver the oral vaccine and immunomodulator by fermentation of food like milk, which might have striking effects on control of H. pylori infection, gastrointestinal cancers, and Th2 bias allergic diseases, including many food allergies.",
        "# Title: Protective immunity induced by an intranasal multivalent vaccine comprising 10 Lactococcus lactis strains expressing highly prevalent M-protein antigens derived from Group A Streptococcus.\n# Abstract: Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) causes diseases ranging from mild pharyngitis to severe invasive infections. The N-terminal fragment of streptococcal M protein elicits protective antibodies and is an attractive vaccine target. However, this N- terminal fragment is hypervariable: there are more than 200 different M types. In this study, an intranasal live bacterial vaccine comprising 10 strains of Lactococcus lactis, each expressing one N-terminal fragment of M protein, has been developed. Live bacterial-vectored vaccines cost less to manufacture because the processes involved are less complex than those required for production of protein subunit vaccines. Moreover, intranasal administration does not require syringes or specialized personnel. Evaluation of individual vaccine types (M1, M2, M3, M4, M6, M9, M12, M22, M28 and M77) showed that most of them protected mice against challenge with virulent S. pyogenes. All 10 strains combined in a 10-valent vaccine (M×10) induced serum and bronchoalveolar lavage IgG titers that ranged from three- to 10-fold those of unimmunized mice. After intranasal challenge with M28 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice was significantly higher than that of unimmunized mice. In contrast, when mice were challenged with M75 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice did not differ significantly from that of unimmunized mice. Mx-10 immunized mice had significantly less S. pyogenes in oropharyngeal washes and developed less severe disease symptoms after challenge than did unimmunized mice. Our L. lactis-based vaccine may provide an alternative solution to development of broadly protective group A streptococcal vaccines.",
        "# Title: Mucosal and systemic immune responses elicited by recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a fusion protein composed of pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin from Bordetella pertussis.\n# Abstract: We constructed a food-grade expression system harboring a F1S1 fusion protein of Bordetella pertussis to be produced in Lactococcus lactis NZ3900 as a new oral vaccine model against whooping cough, caused by B. pertussis. F1S1 was composed of N-terminally truncated S1 subunit of pertussis toxin and type I immunodominant domain of filamentous hemagglutinin which are both known as protective immunogens against pertussis. The recombinant L. lactis was administered via oral or intranasal routes to BALB/c mice and the related specific systemic and mucosal immune responses were then evaluated. The results indicated significantly higher levels of specific IgA in the lung extracts and IgG in sera of mucosally-immunized mice, compared to their controls. It was revealed that higher levels of IgG2a, compared to IgG1, were produced in all mucosally-immunized mice. Moreover, immunized mice developed Th1 responses with high levels of IFN-γ production by the spleen cells. These findings provide evidence for L. lactis to be used as a suitable vehicle for expression and delivery of F1S1 fusion protein to mucosa and induction of appropriate systemic and mucosal immune responses against pertussis.",
        "# Title: Rotavirus VP6 protein mucosally delivered by cell wall-derived particles from Lactococcus lactis induces protection against infection in a murine model.\n# Abstract: Rotaviruses are the primary cause of acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide. Although the implementation of live attenuated vaccines has reduced the number of rotavirus-associated deaths, variance in their effectiveness has been reported in different countries. This fact, among other concerns, leads to continuous efforts for the development of new generation of vaccines against rotavirus.In this work, we describe the obtention of cell wall-derived particles from a recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a cell wall-anchored version of the rotavirus VP6 protein. After confirming by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, flow cytometry and electronic immunomicroscopy that these particles were carrying the VP6 protein, their immunogenic potential was evaluated in adult BALB/c mice. For that, mucosal immunizations (oral or intranasal), with or without the dmLT [(double mutant Escherichia coli heat labile toxin LT(R192G/L211A)] adjuvant were performed. The results showed that these cell wall-derived particles were able to generate anti-rotavirus IgG and IgA antibodies only when administered intranasally, whether the adjuvant was present or not. However, the presence of dmLT was necessary to confer protection against rotavirus infection, which was evidenced by a 79.5 percent viral shedding reduction.In summary, this work describes the production of cell wall-derived particles which were able to induce a protective immune response after intranasal immunization. Further studies are needed to characterize the immune response elicited by these particles as well as to determine their potential as an alternative to the use of live L. lactis for mucosal antigen delivery.",

        "# Title: A Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB)-Based Vaccine Candidate for Human Norovirus.\n# Abstract: Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are responsible for more than 95% of the non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis epidemics in the world. The CDC estimates that every year 21 million individuals suffer from HuNoV-induced gastroenteritis in the United States. Currently, there is no FDA-approved vaccine for HuNoVs. Development of an effective vaccine has been hampered by the lack of an efficient cell culture system for HuNoVs and a suitable small animal model for pathogenesis study. In this study, we developed lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as a vector to deliver HuNoV antigen. A LAB strain (Lactococcus lactis) carrying VP1 gene of a HuNoV GII.4 virus (LAB-VP1) was constructed. It was found that HuNoV VP1 protein was highly expressed by LAB vector and was secreted into media supernatants. To test whether LAB-based HuNoV vaccine candidate is immunogenic, 4-day-old gnotobiotic piglets were orally inoculated with various doses of LAB-VP1. It was found that LABs were persistent in the small intestine of piglets and shed in pig feces for at least 25 days post inoculation. LAB DNA and VP1 were detected in mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen tissue in LAB-VP1 inoculated groups. HuNoV-specific IgG and IgA were detectable in serum and feces respectively at day 13 post-inoculation, and further increased at later time points. After being challenged with HuNoV GII.4 strain, a large amount of HuNoV antigens were observed in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum sections of the intestine in the LAB control group. In contrast, significantly less, or no, HuNoV antigens were detected in the LAB-VP1 immunized groups. Collectively, these results demonstrate that a LAB-based HuNoV vaccine induces protective immunity in gnotobiotic piglets.",

        "# Title: Mucosal Vaccination with Lactococcus lactis-Secreting Surface Immunological Protein Induces Humoral and Cellular Immune Protection against Group B Streptococcus in a Murine Model.\n# Abstract: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the primary etiological agent of sepsis and meningitis in newborns and is associated with premature birth and stillbirth. The development of a licensed vaccine is one of the pending challenges for the World Health Organization. Previously, we showed that oral immunization with surface immune protein (SIP) decreases vaginal colonization of GBS and generates functional opsonizing antibodies, which was determined by opsonophagocytic assays (OPA) in vitro. We also showed that the protein has an adjuvant vaccine profile. Therefore, an oral vaccine based on SIP may be an attractive alternative to employ in the development of new vaccines against GBS. Lactococcus lactis is a highlighted oral vaccine probiotic inducer of the mucosal immune response. This bacterium could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of an edible vaccine and has been used in clinical trials. In this study, we showed that an oral vaccine with a recombinant L. lactis strain secreting SIP from GBS (rL. lactis-SIP) can induce protective humoral and cellular immunity in an experimental model of GBS vaginal colonization in C57BL/6 mice. Mice immunized with rL. lactis-SIP were protected against clinical symptoms and bacterial colonization after GBS vaginal colonization. Our rL. lactis-SIP vaccine also induces an increase of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) specifically against SIP. The adoptive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice to naïve mice generated protection against GBS vaginal colonization. Moreover, the rL. lactis-SIP strain induces the activation of SIP-specific T cells, which could decrease GBS vaginal colonization and generate protective antibodies when transferred to other mice. Our experimental observations strongly support the notion that rL. lactis-SIP induces protective humoral and cellular immunity and could be considered as a novel alternative in the development of vaccines for GBS.",
        "# Title: Recombinant Lactococcus Lactis Displaying Omp31 Antigen of Brucella melitensis Can Induce an Immunogenic Response in BALB/c Mice.\n# Abstract: Since Brucella infection mostly occurs through the mucosal surfaces, immune response induced by vaccine that is delivered by a way of mucosal route can be drastically enhanced to control the brucellosis. Omp31is the major outer membrane protein of Brucella, and is considered as a protective antigen against Brucella infection. Accordingly, Lactococcus lactis has been used as an antigen-delivering vector to develop a vaccine-induced mucosal response for having a safer vaccination against brucellosis. A designed omp31 gene fused to the usp45 signal peptide and M6 cell wall anchor was sub cloned in the pNZ7021 expression vector, and a recombinant L. lactis displaying Omp31 was constructed. Omp31 protein expression was confirmed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. Animals were orally and intraperitoneally immunized with live or killed L. lactis expressing Omp31, respectively. The humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated by measuring the specific cytokines and antibodies. sIgA, serum IgA, IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in the mice immunized with live recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31 and also serum IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in mice immunized with killed recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31. Among IgG subtypes, IgG2a response was significantly higher in both groups compared to IgG1. In mice groups immunized with recombinant L. lactis, the IFN-γ and IL-10 level elevated; however, there was no change in the level of IL-4. These results indicated that recombinants L. lactis induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, and also vaccines based on L. lactis-derived live carriers are promising interventions against Brucella melitensis infections.",
        "# Title: Lactococcus lactis FNBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) Induces Cellular and Humoral Immune Responses After Oral Immunization of Mice.\n# Abstract: The development of a new vaccine strategy against tuberculosis is urgently needed and has been greatly encouraged by the scientific community worldwide. In this work, we constructed a lactococcal DNA vaccine based on the fusion of two Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens, ESAT-6 and Ag85A, and examined its immunogenicity. The coding sequences of the ESAT-6 and Ag85A genes were fused and cloned into the eukaryotic expression pValac vector, and the functionality of the vector was confirmed in vitro. Then, L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) was obtained and used for oral immunization of mice. This strain induced significant increases in IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-17 cytokines in stimulated splenocyte cultures, and significant production of antigen-specific sIgA was observed in the colonic tissues of immunized mice. We demonstrated that L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) generated a cellular and humoral immune response after oral immunization of mice. The strategy developed in this work may represent an interesting DNA mucosal vaccine candidate against tuberculosis, using the fusion of two highly immunogenic antigens delivered by safe lactic acid bacteria.",
        "# Title: Protective Immunity Against Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli by Oral Vaccination of Engineered Lactococcus lactis.\n# Abstract: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the leading causes of diarrhea in children globally, and thus suitable vaccines are desired. Antigen display on lactic acid bacteria is a reliable approach for efficient oral vaccination and preventing bowel diseases. To develop an oral vaccine against ETEC, the gene of the binding domain from heat-labile toxin (LTB), a key ETEC virulence factor, was codon-optimized and cloned into a construct containing a signal peptide and an anchor for display on L. lactis. Bioinformatics analysis showed a codon adaptation index of 0.95 for the codon-optimized gene. Cell surface expression of LTB was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and blotting. White New Zealand rabbits were immunized per os (PO) with the recombinant L. lactis, and the antibody titers were assayed with ELISA. In vitro neutralization assay was performed using mouse adrenal tumor cells and rabbit ileal loop test was performed as the in vivo assay. ELISA results indicated that oral administration of the engineered L. lactis elicited a significant production of IgA in the intestine. In vitro neutralization assay showed that the effect of the toxin could be neutralized with 500 µg/ml of IgG isolated from the oral vaccine group. Furthermore, the dose of ETEC causing fluid accumulation in the ileal loop test showed a tenfold increase in rabbits immunized with either recombinant L. lactis or LTB protein compared to other groups. Our results imply that recombinant L. lactis could potentially be an effective live oral vaccine against ETEC toxicity.",
        "# Title: Oral Immunization of Mice with Cell Extracts from Recombinant Lactococcus lactis Expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein.\n# Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all over the world and became a pandemic that named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). At present, several intramuscular vaccines have been successfully developed and mass vaccination has progressed in many countries. The aim of the study is to develop and examine an oral vaccine against COVID-19 with recombinant Lactococcus lactis IL1403, a strain of lactic acid bacteria, expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) S1 subunit as an immunizing antigen. PBS or cell extracts from recombinant L. lactis were orally administered into mice (control VS treatment), and formation of antigen-specific antibodies and changes in the gut microbiome were analyzed. Intracellular antigen was detected, but its secretion was not successful. After immunization, antigen-specific serum IgG and fecal IgA levels were 1.5-fold (P = 0.002) and 1.4-fold (P = 0.016) higher in the immunized mice (treatment) than control, respectively. Gut microbiome profiles were clearly separated between the two groups when analyzed for beta diversity with overall similarity. At the genus level, while Coprococcus (P = 0.036) and unclassified genus of Ruminococcaceae (P = 0.037) in treatment were more abundant than control, rc4-4 (P = 0.013) and Stenotrophomonas (P = 0.021) were less abundant. Our results indicate that cell extract containing SARS-CoV-2 antigen can induce mice to produce antigen-specific antibodies without overall changes in the gut microbiome. This strategy may be useful for the development of other oral viral vaccines.",
        "# Title: Oral Immunization With a M Cell-Targeting Recombinant L. Lactis Vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE Stimulate Protective Immunity Against H. Pylori in Mice.\n# Abstract: There are many virulence factors of H. pylori that contribute in diverse ways to gastric disease. Therefore, designing multivalent epitope vaccines against many key virulence factors virulence factors of H. pylori is a promising strategy to control H. pylori infection. In previous studies, we constructed a multivalent epitope vaccine FVpE against four key virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), and oral immunization with the FVpE vaccine plus a polysaccharide adjuvant (PA) containing lycium barbarum polysaccharide and chitosan could provide protection against H. pylori infection in the Mongolian gerbil model. Oral vaccines have many advantages over injected vaccines, such as improved safety and compliance, and easier manufacturing and administration. However, the harsh gastrointestinal (GI) environment, such as gastric acid and proteolytic enzymes, limits the development of oral vaccines to some extent. Oral vaccines need a gastrointestinal delivery system with high safety, low price and promoting vaccine antigen to stimulate immune response in the gastrointestinal mucosa. Lactic acid bacteria are gastrointestinal probiotics that have unique advantages as a delivery system for oral vaccines. In this study, a M cell-targeting surface display system for L. lactis named plSAM was designed to help vaccine antigens to stimulate effective immune responses in the gastrointestinal tract, and a M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE was constructed by using the surface display system plSAM. recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE could secretively express the SAM-FVpE protein and display it on the bacterial surface. Moreover, experimental results confirmed that LL-plSAM-FVpE had an enhanced M cell-targeting property. In addition, LL-plSAM-FVpE had excellent M cell-targeting property to promote the phagocytosis and transport of the antigen SAM-FVpE by gastrointestinal M cells. More importantly, oral immunization of LL-plSAM-FVpE or SAM-FVpE plus PA can stimulate IgG and sIgA antibodies and CD4+ T cell immune responses against four virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), thus providing protective immunity against H. pylori infection in mice. The M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine against various key H. pylori virulence factors could be a promising vaccine candidate for controlling H. pylori infection.",
        "# Title: Oral and intranasal immunization with food-grade recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing high conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein triggers mice's immunity responses.\n# Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic began at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread throughout the world. Vaccination is still the most effective method of prevention of pathogenic infections, including viral infections. However, there is little evidence that vaccination can protect against SARS-CoV-2 virus for a long time. Thus, regular re-vaccination is necessary to control COVID-19. Vaccination by injection is invasive, and is one of the reasons people refuse to get re-vaccinated. Therefore, we developed a less invasive vaccine based on oral or nasal administration. The gene encoding the high conserved region (HCR) spike protein was inserted into pNZ8149 and expressed in L.lactis NZ3900. Mice were immunized at 3-week intervals with oral or nasal routes. Anti-SARS-CoV2 spike antibody (IgG and IgA) level were measured using ELISA method before and after treatment. Plasma cells population in lymph were analyzed using flowcytometry and the CD4 + and CD8 + cells in lymph and intestine were analyzed using immunofluorescence method. The results of nasal and oral administration in experimental animals showed that L.lactis carrying the HCR gene could induce a humoral immune response, as indicated by increased levels of IgG and IgA against SARS-CoV-2 (IgG/IgA-SARS-CoV-2). The plasma cell population after nasal and oral vaccination in mice were significantly different with control group (p < 0.05). The CD4 + and CD8 + cells in intestine were significantly higher in orally immunized group mice than control group. The CD8 + cells in lymph were significantly higher in intranasal immunized group mice than control group. Our data demonstrate L.lactis expressing spike protein can be developed into a less invasive alternative to nasal and oral vaccination.",
        "# Title: Expanding strain coverage of a group A Streptococcus pilus-expressing Lactococcus lactis mucosal vaccine.\n# Abstract: Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a human pathogenic bacterium that can trigger a wide range of diseases, including the autoimmune diseases acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, causing major morbidity and mortality in many low- and middle-income countries. Primary intervention programs have had limited success thus far, and a licensed vaccine has yet to be developed. The pilus of GAS is known to be involved in host cell adhesion, biofilm formation and immune evasion. We have a mucosal vaccine in development that expresses the pilus of GAS on the surface of the nonpathogenic bacterium Lactococcus lactis. To expand strain coverage, we combined seven L. lactis constructs, each expressing a different GAS pilus variant, and investigated the systemic and mucosal immune responses following immunization. Mice immunized with this combination showed specific immunoglobin G and immunoglobin A responses to the GAS pilus proteins of vaccine strains, at levels comparable to mice immunized with a single construct. Cross-reactivity to pilus proteins of nonvaccine strains was also evident. Furthermore, protective efficacy against a homologous strain of GAS in a murine nasopharyngeal colonization model was observed. Overall, this study provides further evidence for using pilus-expressing lactic acid bacteria as a vaccine to prevent upper respiratory tract GAS infections."

The current study analyzed the clinical significance of this new stage in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Subjects and Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 4045 eligible PTC patients. The patients were divided into four groups according to the extent of ETE: no ETE, ETE into perithyroidal tissue, T3b (ETE into the strap muscles), and ETE beyond the strap muscles. Differences in the clinical characteristics and prognosis of the four groups were assessed. Results: Of these 4045 patients, 2300 (56.9%) had no ETE, 1004 (24.8%) had ETE into perithyroidal tissue, 371 (9.2%) had ETE into the strap muscles, and 370 (9.1%) had ETE beyond the strap muscles. Tumor size, multifocality, lymph node metastasis (LNM), distant metastasis (DM), recurrence, and recurrence-free survival (RFS) between patients with ETE into perithyroidal tissue and patients without ETE did not show differences, but significant differences were observed between patients with T3b and patients without ETE, and only patients with ETE beyond the strap muscles had significantly worse overall survival (OS) than the other three groups. However, T3b did not independently predict worse RFS in univariable and multivariable analyses. Conclusions: T3b, distinguished from minimal ETE, may be related to larger tumor size, higher prevalence of multifocality, LNM, DM, recurrence, and worse RFS than no ETE, but it may not affect OS and may not independently predict recurrence in PTC patients.",
        "# Title: Is There a Difference Between Minimal and Gross Extension into the Strap Muscles for the Risk of Recurrence in Papillary Thyroid Carcinomas?\n# Abstract: Background: The morbidity of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is primarily related to locoregional recurrences and distant metastases. The definition of minimal extrathyroidal extension (mETE) has been recently revised. The presence of mETE does not impact mortality and is generally not considered to be a predictor for the risk of recurrence. This study aimed at comparing the risk of recurrence and the response to therapy of PTC with mETE and gross extrathyroidal extension (ETE) into the strap muscles (gETE) with low- and intermediate-risk PTC without ETE (low risk w/o ETE and intermediate risk w/o ETE, respectively) to further characterize the impact of ETE on outcomes. Methods: A total of 596 PTCs were analyzed according to the degree of ETE as well as other predictors of recurrence. Four groups of patients were compared, low risk w/o ETE (n = 251), intermediate risk w/o ETE (n = 89), mETE (n = 191), and gETE (n = 65), to determine the risk of recurrence and the response to treatment. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate associations between groups and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: The risk of recurrence was 3% in low risk w/o ETE PTC, 14% in intermediate risk w/o ETE, 14% in mETE, and 25% in gETE. The recurrence risk was increased by the presence of ETE (odds ratio [OR] = 2.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-5.85, p = 0.005) and lymph node metastases (OR = 2.44 [95% CI 1.25-4.76], p = 0.009). Patients with low-risk carcinomas w/o ETE experienced longer DFS than those with mETE (hazard ratio = 0.08 [95% CI 0.02-0.28], p < 0.001), but no significant difference was observed between intermediate risk w/o ETE, mETE, and gETE. In terms of the response to therapy, patients with gETE had higher rates of biochemical and/or structural incomplete responses within the first year of treatment (OR = 2.68 [95% CI 1.31-5.45], p = 0.007) and at the final follow-up evaluation (OR = 4.35 [95% CI 1.99-9.51], p < 0.001) compared with those with mETE. An analysis of the subgroups of microcarcinomas without lymph node metastases revealed no significant difference in DFS or the response to therapy between the low risk w/o ETE and mETE PTC groups. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that both mETE and gETE are independent risk factors for the risk of recurrence in PTC. Although gETE has a more pronounced impact on the recurrence risk and is associated with a worse response to therapy, mETE may not be associated with a low risk of recurrence. This observation suggests that patients with PTC and mETE may, in part, have an intermediate risk of recurrence and need to be followed accordingly."

Loss of LKB1 promotes cancer progression and influences therapeutic responses in preclinical studies; however, specific targeted therapies for lung cancer with LKB1 inactivation are currently unavailable. Here, we have identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) signature that is associated with the loss of LKB1 function. We discovered that LINC00473 is consistently the most highly induced gene in LKB1-inactivated human primary NSCLC samples and derived cell lines. Elevated LINC00473 expression correlated with poor prognosis, and sustained LINC00473 expression was required for the growth and survival of LKB1-inactivated NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, LINC00473 was induced by LKB1 inactivation and subsequent cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)/CREB-regulated transcription coactivator (CRTC) activation. We determined that LINC00473 is a nuclear lncRNA and interacts with NONO, a component of the cAMP signaling pathway, thereby facilitating CRTC/CREB-mediated transcription. Collectively, our study demonstrates that LINC00473 expression potentially serves as a robust biomarker for tumor LKB1 functional status that can be integrated into clinical trials for patient selection and treatment evaluation, and implicates LINC00473 as a therapeutic target for LKB1-inactivated NSCLC.",

Moreover, we found that LINC00473 enhanced the growth of cervical cancer cells in vivo. Mechanistic investigation showed that LINC00473 directly interacted with ILF2 and suppressed its degradation.

Recent studies reported that lncRNA LINC00473 (LNC473) was involved in cancer progression. However, the clinical significance and functional role of LNC473 in HCC progression is still unknown. In the present study, we found that the LNC473 expression was markedly elevated in HCC tissues and correlated with bigger tumor size, higher BCLC stage, vascular invasion and poor prognosis. Gain- and loss-of-function assay showed that LNC473 enhanced HCC cell proliferation and invasion and induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Mechanistically, LNC473 associated with oncoprotein survivin and regulates its stability. Moreover, LNC473 could recruit deubiquitinase USP9X to inhibit the ubiquitination level of survivin and then increase survivin expression. Therefore, our results suggest that LNC473 exerts its functions as an oncogene in HCC progression and may be a therapeutic target for HCC treatment.",
        "# Title: LINC00473 predicts poor prognosis and regulates cell migration and invasion in gastric cancer.\n# Abstract: LINC00473 is an intergenic long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and has been suggested to be dysregulated in several human cancers. However, the clinical value and biological function of LINC00473 in gastric cancer (GC) was still unknown. In our results, LINC00473 expression was increased in GC tissue samples and GC cell lines compared with paired adjacent normal stomach tissue samples and normal gastric epithelial cell line, respectively. High-expression of LINC00473 was correlated with poor histological type, advanced clinical stage, more lymph node metastasis and present distant metastasis. The results of Kaplan-Meier analysis and TCGA database similarly suggested that GC patients with LINC00473 high-expression had poorer prognosis than GC patients with LINC00473 low-expression. Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that LINC00473 high-expression served as independent unfavorable prognostic factor for overall survival in GC patients. The study in vitro indicated that silencing of LINC00473 had no effect on GC cell viability, but inhibited GC cell migration and invasion through modulating MMP2 and MMP9 expression. In conclusion, LINC00473 is associated with the malignant status and prognosis in GC cases, and functions as an oncogenic lncRNA to regulate GC cell migration and invasion.",

        "# Title: Long noncoding RNA LINC00473 functions as a competing endogenous RNA to regulate MAPK1 expression by sponging miR-198 in breast cancer.\n# Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) is one of the primary tumors with high incidence in women. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of LINC00473 and underlying mechanisms in BC. Expression pattern of LINC00473 was analyzed using qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) assays in BC tissues and cells. Overexpression or knockdown of LINC00473 in vitro and functional experiments were performed to study its effects on BC cells. Target prediction, luciferase assays, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and RNA immunoprecipitation were used to verify the role of LINC00473 as a competing endogenous RNA. The impact of LINC00473 on tumor growth was also evaluated using a xenograft model. In our study, we found that LINC00473 was highly expressed in BC tissues and cells, and the elevated expression was correlated with shorter overall survival in patients with BC. Furthermore, knockdown of LINC00473 significantly inhibited the capacity of proliferation, invasion and migration of BC cells. Animal experiment suggested that silencing LINC00473 could significantly inhibit the tumor growth. Following experiments revealed that LINC00473 may function as a competing endogenous RNA to regulate the expression of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1 (MAPK1) through competition for miR-198. Thus, increased expression of LINC00473 in breast cancer tissues is linked to poor prognosis. LINC00473 may function as an endogenous completive RNA by sponging miR-198 to regulate MAPK1 expression. Findings of our study contributed to the basis for further exploring the application of LINC00473 as a prognostic and diagnostic biomarker.",
        "# Title: Long non‑coding RNA LINC00473/miR‑195‑5p promotes glioma progression via YAP1‑TEAD1‑Hippo signaling.\n# Abstract: There is an urgent need to identify novel potential therapeutic targets for diagnosis and treatment of glioma, a common primary tumor in brain, due to its high‑level invasiveness. Long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00473 has been reported as potentially critical regulators in various types of cancer tumorigenesis. However, the effects of LINC00473 on glioma cells is unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the clinical significance, effects and mechanism of LINC00437 on glioma tumorigenesis. In the present study, LINC00473 was significantly increased in glioma tissues and in cell models, and predicted a poor prognosis in patients with glioma. Notably, LINC00473 knockdown not only suppressed cell proliferation, invasion and migration of glioma cells, but also blocked cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis. Subcutaneous xenotransplanted tumor model experiments revealed that reduced LINC00473 expression was able to suppress in vivo glioma growth. Mechanistically, LINC00473 functioned as a competing endogenous (ce)RNA to decrease microRNA (miR)‑195‑5p expression. Moreover, Yes‑associated protein 1 (YAP1) and TEA domain family member 1 (TEAD1) were identified as downstream targets of miR‑195‑5p, whose expression levels were inhibited by miR‑195‑5p. LINC00473 knockdown suppressed glioma progression through the decrease of miR‑195‑5p and subsequent increase of YAP1 and TEAD1 expression levels. These results indicated LINC00473 might act as a ceRNA to sponge miR‑195‑5p, thus promoting YAP1 and TEAD1 expressions, and shedding light on the underlying mechanisms of LINC00473‑induced glioma progression.",
        "# Title: LINC00473 contributes to the radioresistance of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by regulating microRNA‑497‑5p and cell division cycle 25A.\n# Abstract: Long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00473 plays a carcinogenic role in a variety of different tumor types. Nevertheless, the mechanisms through which LINC00473 regulates the radiosensitivity of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells remains elusive. In the present study, reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR was used to quantify the expression of LINC00473, microRNA (miRNA/miR)‑497‑5p and cell division cycle 25A (CDC25A) in ESCC tissues. The association between LINC00473 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with ESCC was also assessed. Furthermore, Cell Counting kit‑8 and colony formation assays were carried out to monitor the proliferation of ESCC cells exposed to X‑ray radiation. A dual‑luciferase reporter assay was also conducted to analyze the interaction between LINC00473 and miR‑497‑5p, as well as the interaction between CDC25A and miR‑497‑5p. The findings of the present study demonstrated that in ESCC tissues and cells, the expression levels of LINC00473 and CDC25A were significantly upregulated, while the expression of miR‑497‑5p was downregulated. The high expression level of LINC00473 was associated with a higher T stage, lymph node metastasis stage and a lower tumor differentiation grade in patients with ESCC. Following irradiation, transfection with miR‑497‑5p mimics reduced the promoting effect of LINC00473 overexpression on ESCC cell proliferation, and partially impeded the resistance of ESCC cells to X‑ray radiation induced by LINC00473 overexpression. Moreover, transfection with miR‑497‑5p inhibitors partially alleviated the inhibitory effects of LINC00473 knockdown on cellular proliferation, and partly reversed the sensitivity of cells to X‑ray irradiation induced by LINC00473 knockdown. Furthermore, it was confirmed that miR‑497‑5p was able to bind LINC00473 and the 3'‑untranslated region of CDC25A. On the whole, the findings of the present study demonstrate that LINC00473 reduces the radiosensitivity of ESCC cells by modulating the miR‑497‑5p/CDC25A axis.",

        "# Title: LNC473 Regulating APAF1 IRES-Dependent Translation via Competitive Sponging miR574 and miR15b: Implications in Colorectal Cancer.\n# Abstract: A growing number of studies have focused on the involvement of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in the internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated translation in tumorigenesis; however, the underlying mechanisms in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain elusive. In this study, we show that LINC00473 (LNC473) exerted its functions as a tumor suppressor in promoting apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF1) IRES activity through competitively sponging miR574-5p and miR15b-5p in CRC initiation and pathogenesis. Specifically, LNC473 and its downstream target APAF1 were significantly downregulated accompanied by upregulated miR574-5p and miR15b-5p in CRC cells and tissues, which had a significant prognostic impact on clinical outcomes in our CRC cohort (n = 157). Furthermore, ectopic LNC473 significantly sponged endogenous miR574-5p or miR15b-5p and thereby inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation capacity, and it accelerated cell apoptosis through activating the APAF1-CASP9-CASP3 pathway. Notably, LNC473 overexpression resulted in dramatic promotion of APAF1 IRES activity and translation, whereas rescue experiments confirmed the recovery by the existence of LNC473 and miR574/15b-5p. Mechanistically, LNC473 overexpression promoted IRES binding domain exposure and removed the constraints controlling from miR574-5p and miR15b-5p, and subsequently enhanced IRES-mediated APAF1 expression in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, our results uncover a novel LNC473-miR574/miR15b-APAF1 signaling axis, which provides new targets and crosstalk regulation mechanism for CRC prevention and treatment.",
        "# Title: Knockdown of LINC00473 promotes radiosensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer cells via sponging miR-513a-3p.\n# Abstract: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung cancer. Radioresistance is a significant obstacle in NSCLC radiotherapy. Long non-coding RNA LINC00473 has been found to impact the radiotherapy in several malignant tumours. This study aimed to investigate the underlying role and mechanism of LINC00473 in regulating radiosensitivity of NSCLC cells. The levels of LINC00473 and miR-513a-3p were measured by quantitative Real-Time PCR. The relationship of LINC00473 with overall survival was tested by the Kaplan-Meier method. The effects of LINC00473 on cell viability and cell survival were assessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony survival assay in NSCLC cells exposed to different doses of radiation. A luciferase reporter assay was used to investigate the correlation between LINC00473 and miR-513a-3p. The present study showed that the relative LINC00473 expression was upregulated and miR-513a-3p expression was downregulated in radioresistant NSCLC patients compared with radiosensitive patients. And upregulated LINC00473 expression was associated with poor prognosis of NSCLC patients after radiotherapy. Radiation led to an increase in LINC00473 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The knockdown of LINC00473 markedly promoted radiosensitivity in NSCLC cells under different doses of radiation. LINC00473 was a sponge of miR-513a-3p and negatively regulated the miR-513a-3p expression. In conclusion, the inhibition of miR-513a-3p markedly reversed the promoted effect of LINC00473 knockdown on cell radiosensitivity. LINC00473 inhibition enhances radiosensitivity of NSCLC by sponging miR-513a-3p, providing a promising therapeutic target to increase the sensitivity of radiotherapy in NSCLC patients.",
        "# Title: lncRNA LINC00473 promotes proliferation, migration, invasion and inhibition of apoptosis of non-small cell lung cancer cells by acting as a sponge of miR-497-5p.\n# Abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-associated death worldwide and exhibits a poor prognosis. The present study aimed to determine the effect of long non-coding (lnc)RNA-LINC00473 on the development of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells by regulating the expression of microRNA (miR)-497-5p. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was conducted to detect the level of LINC00473 and miR-497-5p. An MTT assay, flow cytometry and Transwell tests were performed to evaluate the proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells. Western blotting was performed to detect the expression of apoptosis- and migration-related proteins. RNA immunoprecipitation and a luciferase reporter assay were performed to verify the regulatory relationship between lncRNA-LINC00473 and miR-497-5p. LINC00473 expression was upregulated in lung cancer tissues and NSCLC cells (A549 and H1299) when compared with adjacent tissues or human bronchial epithelial cell lines and the 5-year survival rate was lower in patients with high LINC00473 expression compared with in patients with low LINC00473 expression. A negative correlation between LINC00473 and miR-497-5p was observed in lung cancer tissues. Proliferation, migration and invasion as well as the related protein levels were increased in A549 and H1299 transfected with pcDNA3.1-LINC00473, while the opposite results were obtained in A549 and H1299 transfected with small interfering (si)-LINC00473. Notably, it was demonstrated that LINC00473 could bind directly with miR-497-5p and inhibit its expression. miR-497-5p inhibitors reversed the effect of si-LINC00473. Furthermore, the present study demonstrated that LINC00473 promoted the malignant behaviour of NSCLC cells via regulating the ERK/p38 and MAPK signalling pathways and the expression of miR-497-5p.",
        "# Title: Long intergenic non-coding RNA 00473 promotes proliferation and migration of gastric cancer via the miR-16-5p/CCND2 axis and by regulating AQP3.\n# Abstract: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, but its molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Increasing evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) play a pivotal role in various cancers recently. Our present study focused on exploring the function of long intergenic non-coding RNA 00473 (LINC00473) in GC. In this study, we found that LINC00473 expression was aberrantly increased in tumor tissues compared with the paired para-cancerous tissues. The expression of high LINC00473 in GC was notably correlated with a higher risk of lymphatic metastasis, a higher incidence of vascular cancer embolus, and advanced TNM stage. Further experiments showed that the overexpression of LINC00473 could promote the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells both in vitro and in vivo. The apoptosis of GC cells increased significantly by the decrease of LINC00473. Mechanistically, LINC00473 could sponge miR-16-5p in the cytoplasm and relieve its suppression of CCND2. Moreover, AQP3 was found to be a significant downstream target gene for LINC00473 through RNA transcriptome sequencing, as demonstrated by qRT-PCR and western blot. Overexpression of LINC00473 can partially reverse the effects of AQP3 decrease on GC proliferation and metastasis. LINC00473 regulated AQP3 expression through CREB was confirmed by western blot. Our research indicates that LINC00473/miR-16-5p/CCND2 axis plays a role in the proliferation of GC and modulates AQP3 to influence GC cell metastasis, making it a potential therapeutic target for GC."

        "# Title: Long-term CD4+ T-cell response to highly active antiretroviral therapy according to baseline CD4+ T-cell count.\n# Abstract: Current treatment guidelines for HIV infection recommend a relatively late initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Nevertheless, there is still a concern that immune recovery may not be as complete once CD4+ T cells have decreased below a certain threshold. This study addressed the long-term response of CD4+ T-cell counts in patients on HAART and analyzed the influence of baseline CD4+ T-cell counts, baseline viral load, and age. An observational analysis of evolution of CD4+ T cells in 861 antiretroviral therapy-naive chronic HIV-1-infected patients who started treatment consisting of at least 3 drugs in or after 1996 was performed. Patients were classified in 4 groups according to baseline CD4+ T cells: <200 cells/mm3, 200-349 cells/mm3, 350-499 cells/mm3, and >or=500 cells/mm3. The main outcome measures were proportion of patients with CD4+ T cells <200/mm3 and >500/mm3 at last determination and rate of CD4+ T-cell recovery. Patients were followed-up for a median of 173 weeks (interquartile range [IQR], 100-234). There were no differences in follow-up between the 4 groups. CD4+ T cells increased in the whole cohort from a median of 214 cells/mm3 (IQR, 90-355) to 499 cells/mm3 (IQR, 312-733) (P<0.001). Compared with the group with a baseline CD4+ T-cell count of >or=500/mm3, the relative risk of having a last determination of CD4+ T-cell counts >200 cells/mm3 was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.75-0.83), 0.92 (95% CI, 0.89-0.96) and 1 for baseline CD4+ T cells <200 cells/mm3, 200-349 cells/mm3, and 350-499 cells/mm3, respectively. The relative risk of having a last determination of CD4+ T-cell counts >500 cells/mm3 was 0.32 (95% CI, 0.27-0.39, P<0.001), 0.69 (95% CI, 0.60-0.79, P<0.001), and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.83-1.06, P=0.38) for baseline CD4+ T-cell counts <200 cells/mm3, 200-349 cells/mm3, and 350-0499 cells/mm3, respectively, compared with a baseline CD4+ T-cell count of >or=500 cells/mm3. The increase in CD4+ T cells from baseline was statistically significant and was maintained for up to 4 years of follow-up. This increase seemed to slow down after approximately 3 years and reached a plateau after 4-5 years of follow-up even in patients who achieved and maintained viral suppression in plasma. Long-term immune recovery is possible regardless of baseline CD4+ T-cell count. However, patients who start therapy with a CD4+ T-cell count <200 cells/mm3 have poorer immunologic outcome as measured by the proportion of patients with CD4+ T cells <200/mm3 or >500/mm3 at last determination. It seems that the immune recovery slows down after approximately 3 years of HAART and reaches a plateau after 4-5 years of HAART.",

Here, we present data from a retrospective analysis using PET/CT and PET/MRI examinations to investigate the efficacy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET for primary N-staging of patients with prostate cancer (PC) compared with morphologic imaging (CT or MRI) and validated by histopathology. Methods: Data from 58 patients with high-risk PC (according to the D'Amico criteria) who were staged with 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET/CT or PET/MRI at our institution between July 2017 and June 2018 were reviewed. The patients had a median prescan prostate-specific antigen value of 12.2 ng/mL (range, 1.2-81.6 ng/mL). The median injected activity of 18F-rhPSMA-7 was 327 MBq (range, 132-410 MBq), with a median uptake time of 79.5 min (range, 60-153 min). All patients underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection. The presence of lymph node metastases was determined by an experienced reader independently for both the PET and the morphologic datasets using a template-based analysis on a 5-point scale. Patient-level and template-based results were both compared with histopathologic findings. Results: Lymph node metastases were present in 18 patients (31.0%) and were located in 52 of 375 templates (13.9%). Receiver-operating-characteristic analyses showed 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET to perform significantly better than morphologic imaging on both patient-based and template-based analyses (areas under curve, 0.858 vs. 0.649 [P = 0.012] and 0.765 vs. 0.589 [P < 0.001], respectively). On patient-based analyses, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET were 72.2%, 92.5%, and 86.2%, respectively, and those of morphologic imaging were 50.0%, 72.5%, and 65.5%, respectively. On template-based analyses, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET were 53.8%, 96.9%, and 90.9%, respectively, and those of morphologic imaging were 9.6%, 95.0%, and 83.2%, respectively.

The histologic findings of PSMA PET-positive nodes were analyzed retrospectively. A lesion-based and patient-based analysis was performed comparing all positive lesions and only lesions larger than 3 mm on histopathology. Results: Of the patients, 90.6% received 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT for staging before the primary treatment, whereas 9.4% underwent imaging for biochemical recurrence. In 34.4% of the cohort, positive lymph nodes were present on imaging. In total, 1,746 lymph nodes were dissected in 96 patients. 18F-PSMA-1007 PET had a lesion-based sensitivity of 81.7%, a specificity of 99.6%, a positive predictive value of 92.4%, and a negative predictive value of 98.9% for detecting positive lymph nodes larger than 3 mm. In the analysis of all malignant nodes regardless of size, the overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value on lesion-based analysis were 71.2%, 99.5%, 91.3%, and 97.9%, respectively. The patient-based analysis showed a sensitivity of 85.9% and a specificity of 99.5% for lymph nodes larger than 3 mm. Conclusion:18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT reliably detects malignant lymph nodes and has an exceptional specificity of more than 99% for nodal metastases.",

        "# Title: Long-term CD4+ T-cell response to highly active antiretroviral therapy according to baseline CD4+ T-cell count.\n# Abstract: Current treatment guidelines for HIV infection recommend a relatively late initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Nevertheless, there is still a concern that immune recovery may not be as complete once CD4+ T cells have decreased below a certain threshold. This study addressed the long-term response of CD4+ T-cell counts in patients on HAART and analyzed the influence of baseline CD4+ T-cell counts, baseline viral load, and age. An observational analysis of evolution of CD4+ T cells in 861 antiretroviral therapy-naive chronic HIV-1-infected patients who started treatment consisting of at least 3 drugs in or after 1996 was performed. Patients were classified in 4 groups according to baseline CD4+ T cells: <200 cells/mm3, 200-349 cells/mm3, 350-499 cells/mm3, and >or=500 cells/mm3. The main outcome measures were proportion of patients with CD4+ T cells <200/mm3 and >500/mm3 at last determination and rate of CD4+ T-cell recovery. Patients were followed-up for a median of 173 weeks (interquartile range [IQR], 100-234). There were no differences in follow-up between the 4 groups. CD4+ T cells increased in the whole cohort from a median of 214 cells/mm3 (IQR, 90-355) to 499 cells/mm3 (IQR, 312-733) (P<0.001). Compared with the group with a baseline CD4+ T-cell count of >or=500/mm3, the relative risk of having a last determination of CD4+ T-cell counts >200 cells/mm3 was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.75-0.83), 0.92 (95% CI, 0.89-0.96) and 1 for baseline CD4+ T cells <200 cells/mm3, 200-349 cells/mm3, and 350-499 cells/mm3, respectively. The relative risk of having a last determination of CD4+ T-cell counts >500 cells/mm3 was 0.32 (95% CI, 0.27-0.39, P<0.001), 0.69 (95% CI, 0.60-0.79, P<0.001), and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.83-1.06, P=0.38) for baseline CD4+ T-cell counts <200 cells/mm3, 200-349 cells/mm3, and 350-0499 cells/mm3, respectively, compared with a baseline CD4+ T-cell count of >or=500 cells/mm3. The increase in CD4+ T cells from baseline was statistically significant and was maintained for up to 4 years of follow-up. This increase seemed to slow down after approximately 3 years and reached a plateau after 4-5 years of follow-up even in patients who achieved and maintained viral suppression in plasma. Long-term immune recovery is possible regardless of baseline CD4+ T-cell count. However, patients who start therapy with a CD4+ T-cell count <200 cells/mm3 have poorer immunologic outcome as measured by the proportion of patients with CD4+ T cells <200/mm3 or >500/mm3 at last determination. It seems that the immune recovery slows down after approximately 3 years of HAART and reaches a plateau after 4-5 years of HAART.",

Our approach in vaccine development uses recombinant expression of the highly immunogenic HAV antigen VP1-P2a in food-grade lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis and in Escherichia coli. We used genetic constructs that enable nisin-controlled expression of the antigen in L. lactis in three different forms: (a) intracellularly, (b) on the bacterial surface and (c) on the bacterial surface fused with the fragment of the E. coli flagellin molecule that can act as a molecular adjuvant. Expression of the two surface forms of the antigen was achieved in L. lactis, and the resulting antigen-displaying bacteria were administered orally to mice. Half the animals in each of the two groups developed specific IgGs, with titers increasing over time and reaching 1:422 without flagellin and 1:320 with flagellin. A much higher titer 1:25,803 was observed with the parenterally administered antigen, which was purified from E. coli. With the latter, a significant mucosal IgA response was also observed. Despite significant titers, the IgGs elicited with oral or parenteral administration could not prevent HAV from infecting cells in a virus neutralization assay, suggesting that the antibodies cannot recognize viral surface epitopes. Nevertheless, orally administered HAV antigen expressed in L. lactis elicited significant systemic humoral immune response showing the feasibility for development of effective HAV vaccine for mucosal delivery.",
        "# Title: Oral immunization with recombinant Lactococcus lactis delivering a multi-epitope antigen CTB-UE attenuates Helicobacter pylori infection in mice.\n# Abstract: Urease is an essential virulence factor and colonization factor for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and is considered as an excellent vaccine candidate antigen. However, conventional technologies for preparing an injectable vaccine require purification of the antigenic protein and preparation of an adjuvant. Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 (L. lactis) could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of edible vaccine. In previous study, we constructed a multi-epitope vaccine, designated CTB-UE, which is composed of the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), three Th cell epitopes and two B-cell epitopes from urease subunits. To develop a novel type of oral vaccine against H. pylori, genetically modified L. lactis strains were established to secrete this epitope vaccine extracellularly in this study. Oral prophylactic immunization with recombinant L. lactis significantly elicited humoral anti-urease antibody responses (P < 0.001) and reduced the gastric colonization of H. pylori from 7.14 ± 0.95 to 4.68 ± 0.98 log10 CFU g(-1) stomach. This L. lactis oral vaccine offers a promising vaccine candidate for the control of H. pylori infection.",
        "# Title: Development of a new DNA vaccine based on mycobacterial ESAT-6 antigen delivered by recombinant invasive Lactococcus lactis FnBPA+.\n# Abstract: The use of the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis as a vehicle for the oral delivery of DNA vaccine plasmids constitutes a promising strategy for vaccination. The delivery of DNA plasmids into eukaryotic cells is of critical importance for subsequent DNA expression and effectiveness of the vaccine. In this context, the use of the recombinant invasive L. lactis FnBPA+ (fibronectin-binding protein A) strain for the oral delivery of the eukaryotic expression vector vaccination using lactic acid bacteria (pValac), coding for the 6-kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6) gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, could represent a new DNA vaccine strategy against tuberculosis. To this end, the ESAT-6 sequence was cloned into the pValac vector; the L. lactis fibronectin-binding protein A (FnBPA)+ (pValac:ESAT-6) strain was obtained, and its immunological profile was checked in BALB/c mice. This strain was able to significantly increase interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production in spleen cells, showing a systemic T helper 1 (Th1) cell response. The mice also showed a significant increase in specific secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) production in colon tissue and fecal extracts. Thus, this is the first time that L. lactis has been used to deliver a plasmid DNA harboring a gene that encodes an antigen against tuberculosis through mucous membranes.",
        "# Title: Lactococcus lactis displayed neuraminidase confers cross protective immunity against influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Influenza A viruses pose a serious threat to public health. Current influenza A vaccines predominantly focus on hemagglutinin (HA) and show strain-specific protection. Neuraminidase (NA) is much less studied in the context of humoral immunity against influenza A viruses. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cross protective immunity of NA presented on Lactococcus lactis (L.lactis) surface against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in the mouse model. L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA was constructed in which pgsA was used as an anchor protein. Mice vaccinated orally with L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA could elicit significant NA-specific serum IgG and mucosa IgA antibodies, as well as neuraminidase inhibition (NI) titers. Importantly, L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA provided 80% protection against H5N1, 60% protection against H3N2 and H1N1, respectively. These findings suggest that recombinant L.lactis/pNZ110-pgsA-NA in the absence of adjuvant via oral administration can be served as an effective vaccine candidate against diverse strains of influenza A viruses.",
        "# Title: Broadly protective immunity against divergent influenza viruses by oral co-administration of Lactococcus lactis expressing nucleoprotein adjuvanted with cholera toxin B subunit in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines need to be annually reformulated to well match the predicated circulating strains. Thus, it is critical for developing a novel universal influenza vaccine that would be able to confer cross-protection against constantly emerging divergent influenza virus strains. Influenza virus A is a genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses. Influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) is a structural protein which encapsidates the negative strand viral RNA, and anti-NP antibodies play role in cross-protective immunity. Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) is an ideal vaccine delivery vehicle via oral administration route. However, L. lactis vectored vaccine exhibits poor immunogenicity without the use of mucosal adjuvant. To enhance the immunogenicity of L. lactis vectored vaccine, cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit, one of mucosal adjuvants, is a safe adjuvant for oral route, when combined with L. lactis vectored vaccine. In this study, we hypothesized that pNZ8008, a L. lactis expression plasmid, encoding NP antigen, would be able to elicit cross-protection with the use of CTB via oral administration route.",
        "# Title: Cross-protection of Lactococcus lactis-displayed HA2 subunit against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines provide strain-specific protection against homologous subtypes and need to be updated annually. Therefore, it is essential to develop a universal vaccine that would induce broadly cross-protective immunity against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses. The highly conserved HA2 subunit is a promising candidate for developing a universal influenza vaccine. Here, we hypothesized that the HA2 subunit could be displayed on the surface of Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis), using Spax as an anchor protein (L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2) and that L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 would have immunogenicity by oral administration without the use of adjuvant in the mouse model. To address this hypothesis, we show that oral vaccination of mice with L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 elicited significant humoral and mucosal immune responses. Importantly, L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 provided 100% protection against homologous H5N1 or heterologous H1N1 virus challenge. These results suggest that an HA2 subunit presented on the surface of L. lactis is an effective universal vaccine candidate against influenza A viruses in the poultry industry and in humans.",

Most of the current HIV vaccines under development use the i.m. route for immunization, which is relatively poor in generating potent and long-lived mucosal immune responses. In this article, we explore the ability of an oral vaccination with a probiotic organism, Lactococcus lactis, to elicit HIV-specific immune responses in the mucosal and systemic compartments of BALB/c mice. We expressed the HIV-1 Gag-p24 on the tip of the T3 pilus of Streptococcus pyogenes as a fusion to the Cpa protein (LL-Gag). After four monthly LL-Gag oral immunizations, we observed strong Gag-specific IgG and IgA responses in serum, feces, and vaginal secretions. However, the Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses in the blood were at or below our detection limit. After an i.m. modified vaccinia Ankara/Gag boost, we observed robust Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses both in systemic and in mucosal tissues, including intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes of the small intestine, Peyer's patches, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Consistent with strong immunogenicity, the LL-Gag induced activation of CD11c(+) CD11b(+) dendritic cells in the Peyer's patches after oral immunization. Our results demonstrate that oral immunization with L. lactis expressing an Ag on the tip of the group A Streptococcus pilus serves as an excellent vaccine platform to induce strong mucosal humoral and cellular immunity against HIV.",

        "# Title: Production and delivery of Helicobacter pylori NapA in Lactococcus lactis and its protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity.\n# Abstract: Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein A subunit (NapA) has been identified as a virulence factor, a protective antigen and a potent immunomodulator. NapA shows unique application potentials for anti-H. pylori vaccines and treatment strategies of certain allergic diseases and carcinomas. However, appropriate production and utilization modes of NapA still remain uncertain to date. This work has established a novel efficient production and utilization mode of NapA by using L. lactis as an expression host and delivery vector, and demonstrated immune protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity of the engineered L. lactis by oral vaccination of mice. It was observed for the first time that H. pylori NapA promotes both polarized Th17 and Th1 responses, which may greatly affect the clinical application of NapA. This report offers a promising anti-H. pylori oral vaccine candidate and a potent mucosal immune modulatory agent. Meanwhile, it uncovers a way to produce and deliver the oral vaccine and immunomodulator by fermentation of food like milk, which might have striking effects on control of H. pylori infection, gastrointestinal cancers, and Th2 bias allergic diseases, including many food allergies.",
        "# Title: Protective immunity induced by an intranasal multivalent vaccine comprising 10 Lactococcus lactis strains expressing highly prevalent M-protein antigens derived from Group A Streptococcus.\n# Abstract: Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) causes diseases ranging from mild pharyngitis to severe invasive infections. The N-terminal fragment of streptococcal M protein elicits protective antibodies and is an attractive vaccine target. However, this N- terminal fragment is hypervariable: there are more than 200 different M types. In this study, an intranasal live bacterial vaccine comprising 10 strains of Lactococcus lactis, each expressing one N-terminal fragment of M protein, has been developed. Live bacterial-vectored vaccines cost less to manufacture because the processes involved are less complex than those required for production of protein subunit vaccines. Moreover, intranasal administration does not require syringes or specialized personnel. Evaluation of individual vaccine types (M1, M2, M3, M4, M6, M9, M12, M22, M28 and M77) showed that most of them protected mice against challenge with virulent S. pyogenes. All 10 strains combined in a 10-valent vaccine (M×10) induced serum and bronchoalveolar lavage IgG titers that ranged from three- to 10-fold those of unimmunized mice. After intranasal challenge with M28 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice was significantly higher than that of unimmunized mice. In contrast, when mice were challenged with M75 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice did not differ significantly from that of unimmunized mice. Mx-10 immunized mice had significantly less S. pyogenes in oropharyngeal washes and developed less severe disease symptoms after challenge than did unimmunized mice. Our L. lactis-based vaccine may provide an alternative solution to development of broadly protective group A streptococcal vaccines.",
        "# Title: Mucosal and systemic immune responses elicited by recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a fusion protein composed of pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin from Bordetella pertussis.\n# Abstract: We constructed a food-grade expression system harboring a F1S1 fusion protein of Bordetella pertussis to be produced in Lactococcus lactis NZ3900 as a new oral vaccine model against whooping cough, caused by B. pertussis. F1S1 was composed of N-terminally truncated S1 subunit of pertussis toxin and type I immunodominant domain of filamentous hemagglutinin which are both known as protective immunogens against pertussis. The recombinant L. lactis was administered via oral or intranasal routes to BALB/c mice and the related specific systemic and mucosal immune responses were then evaluated. The results indicated significantly higher levels of specific IgA in the lung extracts and IgG in sera of mucosally-immunized mice, compared to their controls. It was revealed that higher levels of IgG2a, compared to IgG1, were produced in all mucosally-immunized mice. Moreover, immunized mice developed Th1 responses with high levels of IFN-γ production by the spleen cells. These findings provide evidence for L. lactis to be used as a suitable vehicle for expression and delivery of F1S1 fusion protein to mucosa and induction of appropriate systemic and mucosal immune responses against pertussis.",
        "# Title: Rotavirus VP6 protein mucosally delivered by cell wall-derived particles from Lactococcus lactis induces protection against infection in a murine model.\n# Abstract: Rotaviruses are the primary cause of acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide. Although the implementation of live attenuated vaccines has reduced the number of rotavirus-associated deaths, variance in their effectiveness has been reported in different countries. This fact, among other concerns, leads to continuous efforts for the development of new generation of vaccines against rotavirus.In this work, we describe the obtention of cell wall-derived particles from a recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a cell wall-anchored version of the rotavirus VP6 protein. After confirming by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, flow cytometry and electronic immunomicroscopy that these particles were carrying the VP6 protein, their immunogenic potential was evaluated in adult BALB/c mice. For that, mucosal immunizations (oral or intranasal), with or without the dmLT [(double mutant Escherichia coli heat labile toxin LT(R192G/L211A)] adjuvant were performed. The results showed that these cell wall-derived particles were able to generate anti-rotavirus IgG and IgA antibodies only when administered intranasally, whether the adjuvant was present or not. However, the presence of dmLT was necessary to confer protection against rotavirus infection, which was evidenced by a 79.5 percent viral shedding reduction.In summary, this work describes the production of cell wall-derived particles which were able to induce a protective immune response after intranasal immunization. Further studies are needed to characterize the immune response elicited by these particles as well as to determine their potential as an alternative to the use of live L. lactis for mucosal antigen delivery.",

        "# Title: A Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB)-Based Vaccine Candidate for Human Norovirus.\n# Abstract: Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are responsible for more than 95% of the non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis epidemics in the world. The CDC estimates that every year 21 million individuals suffer from HuNoV-induced gastroenteritis in the United States. Currently, there is no FDA-approved vaccine for HuNoVs. Development of an effective vaccine has been hampered by the lack of an efficient cell culture system for HuNoVs and a suitable small animal model for pathogenesis study. In this study, we developed lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as a vector to deliver HuNoV antigen. A LAB strain (Lactococcus lactis) carrying VP1 gene of a HuNoV GII.4 virus (LAB-VP1) was constructed. It was found that HuNoV VP1 protein was highly expressed by LAB vector and was secreted into media supernatants. To test whether LAB-based HuNoV vaccine candidate is immunogenic, 4-day-old gnotobiotic piglets were orally inoculated with various doses of LAB-VP1. It was found that LABs were persistent in the small intestine of piglets and shed in pig feces for at least 25 days post inoculation. LAB DNA and VP1 were detected in mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen tissue in LAB-VP1 inoculated groups. HuNoV-specific IgG and IgA were detectable in serum and feces respectively at day 13 post-inoculation, and further increased at later time points. After being challenged with HuNoV GII.4 strain, a large amount of HuNoV antigens were observed in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum sections of the intestine in the LAB control group. In contrast, significantly less, or no, HuNoV antigens were detected in the LAB-VP1 immunized groups. Collectively, these results demonstrate that a LAB-based HuNoV vaccine induces protective immunity in gnotobiotic piglets.",

        "# Title: Mucosal Vaccination with Lactococcus lactis-Secreting Surface Immunological Protein Induces Humoral and Cellular Immune Protection against Group B Streptococcus in a Murine Model.\n# Abstract: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the primary etiological agent of sepsis and meningitis in newborns and is associated with premature birth and stillbirth. The development of a licensed vaccine is one of the pending challenges for the World Health Organization. Previously, we showed that oral immunization with surface immune protein (SIP) decreases vaginal colonization of GBS and generates functional opsonizing antibodies, which was determined by opsonophagocytic assays (OPA) in vitro. We also showed that the protein has an adjuvant vaccine profile. Therefore, an oral vaccine based on SIP may be an attractive alternative to employ in the development of new vaccines against GBS. Lactococcus lactis is a highlighted oral vaccine probiotic inducer of the mucosal immune response. This bacterium could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of an edible vaccine and has been used in clinical trials. In this study, we showed that an oral vaccine with a recombinant L. lactis strain secreting SIP from GBS (rL. lactis-SIP) can induce protective humoral and cellular immunity in an experimental model of GBS vaginal colonization in C57BL/6 mice. Mice immunized with rL. lactis-SIP were protected against clinical symptoms and bacterial colonization after GBS vaginal colonization. Our rL. lactis-SIP vaccine also induces an increase of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) specifically against SIP. The adoptive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice to naïve mice generated protection against GBS vaginal colonization. Moreover, the rL. lactis-SIP strain induces the activation of SIP-specific T cells, which could decrease GBS vaginal colonization and generate protective antibodies when transferred to other mice. Our experimental observations strongly support the notion that rL. lactis-SIP induces protective humoral and cellular immunity and could be considered as a novel alternative in the development of vaccines for GBS.",
        "# Title: Recombinant Lactococcus Lactis Displaying Omp31 Antigen of Brucella melitensis Can Induce an Immunogenic Response in BALB/c Mice.\n# Abstract: Since Brucella infection mostly occurs through the mucosal surfaces, immune response induced by vaccine that is delivered by a way of mucosal route can be drastically enhanced to control the brucellosis. Omp31is the major outer membrane protein of Brucella, and is considered as a protective antigen against Brucella infection. Accordingly, Lactococcus lactis has been used as an antigen-delivering vector to develop a vaccine-induced mucosal response for having a safer vaccination against brucellosis. A designed omp31 gene fused to the usp45 signal peptide and M6 cell wall anchor was sub cloned in the pNZ7021 expression vector, and a recombinant L. lactis displaying Omp31 was constructed. Omp31 protein expression was confirmed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. Animals were orally and intraperitoneally immunized with live or killed L. lactis expressing Omp31, respectively. The humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated by measuring the specific cytokines and antibodies. sIgA, serum IgA, IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in the mice immunized with live recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31 and also serum IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in mice immunized with killed recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31. Among IgG subtypes, IgG2a response was significantly higher in both groups compared to IgG1. In mice groups immunized with recombinant L. lactis, the IFN-γ and IL-10 level elevated; however, there was no change in the level of IL-4. These results indicated that recombinants L. lactis induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, and also vaccines based on L. lactis-derived live carriers are promising interventions against Brucella melitensis infections.",
        "# Title: Lactococcus lactis FNBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) Induces Cellular and Humoral Immune Responses After Oral Immunization of Mice.\n# Abstract: The development of a new vaccine strategy against tuberculosis is urgently needed and has been greatly encouraged by the scientific community worldwide. In this work, we constructed a lactococcal DNA vaccine based on the fusion of two Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens, ESAT-6 and Ag85A, and examined its immunogenicity. The coding sequences of the ESAT-6 and Ag85A genes were fused and cloned into the eukaryotic expression pValac vector, and the functionality of the vector was confirmed in vitro. Then, L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) was obtained and used for oral immunization of mice. This strain induced significant increases in IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-17 cytokines in stimulated splenocyte cultures, and significant production of antigen-specific sIgA was observed in the colonic tissues of immunized mice. We demonstrated that L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) generated a cellular and humoral immune response after oral immunization of mice. The strategy developed in this work may represent an interesting DNA mucosal vaccine candidate against tuberculosis, using the fusion of two highly immunogenic antigens delivered by safe lactic acid bacteria.",
        "# Title: Protective Immunity Against Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli by Oral Vaccination of Engineered Lactococcus lactis.\n# Abstract: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the leading causes of diarrhea in children globally, and thus suitable vaccines are desired. Antigen display on lactic acid bacteria is a reliable approach for efficient oral vaccination and preventing bowel diseases. To develop an oral vaccine against ETEC, the gene of the binding domain from heat-labile toxin (LTB), a key ETEC virulence factor, was codon-optimized and cloned into a construct containing a signal peptide and an anchor for display on L. lactis. Bioinformatics analysis showed a codon adaptation index of 0.95 for the codon-optimized gene. Cell surface expression of LTB was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and blotting. White New Zealand rabbits were immunized per os (PO) with the recombinant L. lactis, and the antibody titers were assayed with ELISA. In vitro neutralization assay was performed using mouse adrenal tumor cells and rabbit ileal loop test was performed as the in vivo assay. ELISA results indicated that oral administration of the engineered L. lactis elicited a significant production of IgA in the intestine. In vitro neutralization assay showed that the effect of the toxin could be neutralized with 500 µg/ml of IgG isolated from the oral vaccine group. Furthermore, the dose of ETEC causing fluid accumulation in the ileal loop test showed a tenfold increase in rabbits immunized with either recombinant L. lactis or LTB protein compared to other groups. Our results imply that recombinant L. lactis could potentially be an effective live oral vaccine against ETEC toxicity.",
        "# Title: Oral Immunization of Mice with Cell Extracts from Recombinant Lactococcus lactis Expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein.\n# Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all over the world and became a pandemic that named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). At present, several intramuscular vaccines have been successfully developed and mass vaccination has progressed in many countries. The aim of the study is to develop and examine an oral vaccine against COVID-19 with recombinant Lactococcus lactis IL1403, a strain of lactic acid bacteria, expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) S1 subunit as an immunizing antigen. PBS or cell extracts from recombinant L. lactis were orally administered into mice (control VS treatment), and formation of antigen-specific antibodies and changes in the gut microbiome were analyzed. Intracellular antigen was detected, but its secretion was not successful. After immunization, antigen-specific serum IgG and fecal IgA levels were 1.5-fold (P = 0.002) and 1.4-fold (P = 0.016) higher in the immunized mice (treatment) than control, respectively. Gut microbiome profiles were clearly separated between the two groups when analyzed for beta diversity with overall similarity. At the genus level, while Coprococcus (P = 0.036) and unclassified genus of Ruminococcaceae (P = 0.037) in treatment were more abundant than control, rc4-4 (P = 0.013) and Stenotrophomonas (P = 0.021) were less abundant. Our results indicate that cell extract containing SARS-CoV-2 antigen can induce mice to produce antigen-specific antibodies without overall changes in the gut microbiome. This strategy may be useful for the development of other oral viral vaccines.",
        "# Title: Oral Immunization With a M Cell-Targeting Recombinant L. Lactis Vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE Stimulate Protective Immunity Against H. Pylori in Mice.\n# Abstract: There are many virulence factors of H. pylori that contribute in diverse ways to gastric disease. Therefore, designing multivalent epitope vaccines against many key virulence factors virulence factors of H. pylori is a promising strategy to control H. pylori infection. In previous studies, we constructed a multivalent epitope vaccine FVpE against four key virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), and oral immunization with the FVpE vaccine plus a polysaccharide adjuvant (PA) containing lycium barbarum polysaccharide and chitosan could provide protection against H. pylori infection in the Mongolian gerbil model. Oral vaccines have many advantages over injected vaccines, such as improved safety and compliance, and easier manufacturing and administration. However, the harsh gastrointestinal (GI) environment, such as gastric acid and proteolytic enzymes, limits the development of oral vaccines to some extent. Oral vaccines need a gastrointestinal delivery system with high safety, low price and promoting vaccine antigen to stimulate immune response in the gastrointestinal mucosa. Lactic acid bacteria are gastrointestinal probiotics that have unique advantages as a delivery system for oral vaccines. In this study, a M cell-targeting surface display system for L. lactis named plSAM was designed to help vaccine antigens to stimulate effective immune responses in the gastrointestinal tract, and a M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE was constructed by using the surface display system plSAM. recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE could secretively express the SAM-FVpE protein and display it on the bacterial surface. Moreover, experimental results confirmed that LL-plSAM-FVpE had an enhanced M cell-targeting property. In addition, LL-plSAM-FVpE had excellent M cell-targeting property to promote the phagocytosis and transport of the antigen SAM-FVpE by gastrointestinal M cells. More importantly, oral immunization of LL-plSAM-FVpE or SAM-FVpE plus PA can stimulate IgG and sIgA antibodies and CD4+ T cell immune responses against four virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), thus providing protective immunity against H. pylori infection in mice. The M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine against various key H. pylori virulence factors could be a promising vaccine candidate for controlling H. pylori infection.",
        "# Title: Oral and intranasal immunization with food-grade recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing high conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein triggers mice's immunity responses.\n# Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic began at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread throughout the world. Vaccination is still the most effective method of prevention of pathogenic infections, including viral infections. However, there is little evidence that vaccination can protect against SARS-CoV-2 virus for a long time. Thus, regular re-vaccination is necessary to control COVID-19. Vaccination by injection is invasive, and is one of the reasons people refuse to get re-vaccinated. Therefore, we developed a less invasive vaccine based on oral or nasal administration. The gene encoding the high conserved region (HCR) spike protein was inserted into pNZ8149 and expressed in L.lactis NZ3900. Mice were immunized at 3-week intervals with oral or nasal routes. Anti-SARS-CoV2 spike antibody (IgG and IgA) level were measured using ELISA method before and after treatment. Plasma cells population in lymph were analyzed using flowcytometry and the CD4 + and CD8 + cells in lymph and intestine were analyzed using immunofluorescence method. The results of nasal and oral administration in experimental animals showed that L.lactis carrying the HCR gene could induce a humoral immune response, as indicated by increased levels of IgG and IgA against SARS-CoV-2 (IgG/IgA-SARS-CoV-2). The plasma cell population after nasal and oral vaccination in mice were significantly different with control group (p < 0.05). The CD4 + and CD8 + cells in intestine were significantly higher in orally immunized group mice than control group. The CD8 + cells in lymph were significantly higher in intranasal immunized group mice than control group. Our data demonstrate L.lactis expressing spike protein can be developed into a less invasive alternative to nasal and oral vaccination.",
        "# Title: Expanding strain coverage of a group A Streptococcus pilus-expressing Lactococcus lactis mucosal vaccine.\n# Abstract: Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a human pathogenic bacterium that can trigger a wide range of diseases, including the autoimmune diseases acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, causing major morbidity and mortality in many low- and middle-income countries. Primary intervention programs have had limited success thus far, and a licensed vaccine has yet to be developed. The pilus of GAS is known to be involved in host cell adhesion, biofilm formation and immune evasion. We have a mucosal vaccine in development that expresses the pilus of GAS on the surface of the nonpathogenic bacterium Lactococcus lactis. To expand strain coverage, we combined seven L. lactis constructs, each expressing a different GAS pilus variant, and investigated the systemic and mucosal immune responses following immunization. Mice immunized with this combination showed specific immunoglobin G and immunoglobin A responses to the GAS pilus proteins of vaccine strains, at levels comparable to mice immunized with a single construct. Cross-reactivity to pilus proteins of nonvaccine strains was also evident. Furthermore, protective efficacy against a homologous strain of GAS in a murine nasopharyngeal colonization model was observed. Overall, this study provides further evidence for using pilus-expressing lactic acid bacteria as a vaccine to prevent upper respiratory tract GAS infections."

Our approach in vaccine development uses recombinant expression of the highly immunogenic HAV antigen VP1-P2a in food-grade lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis and in Escherichia coli. We used genetic constructs that enable nisin-controlled expression of the antigen in L. lactis in three different forms: (a) intracellularly, (b) on the bacterial surface and (c) on the bacterial surface fused with the fragment of the E. coli flagellin molecule that can act as a molecular adjuvant. Expression of the two surface forms of the antigen was achieved in L. lactis, and the resulting antigen-displaying bacteria were administered orally to mice. Half the animals in each of the two groups developed specific IgGs, with titers increasing over time and reaching 1:422 without flagellin and 1:320 with flagellin. A much higher titer 1:25,803 was observed with the parenterally administered antigen, which was purified from E. coli. With the latter, a significant mucosal IgA response was also observed. Despite significant titers, the IgGs elicited with oral or parenteral administration could not prevent HAV from infecting cells in a virus neutralization assay, suggesting that the antibodies cannot recognize viral surface epitopes. Nevertheless, orally administered HAV antigen expressed in L. lactis elicited significant systemic humoral immune response showing the feasibility for development of effective HAV vaccine for mucosal delivery.",
        "# Title: Oral immunization with recombinant Lactococcus lactis delivering a multi-epitope antigen CTB-UE attenuates Helicobacter pylori infection in mice.\n# Abstract: Urease is an essential virulence factor and colonization factor for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and is considered as an excellent vaccine candidate antigen. However, conventional technologies for preparing an injectable vaccine require purification of the antigenic protein and preparation of an adjuvant. Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 (L. lactis) could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of edible vaccine. In previous study, we constructed a multi-epitope vaccine, designated CTB-UE, which is composed of the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), three Th cell epitopes and two B-cell epitopes from urease subunits. To develop a novel type of oral vaccine against H. pylori, genetically modified L. lactis strains were established to secrete this epitope vaccine extracellularly in this study. Oral prophylactic immunization with recombinant L. lactis significantly elicited humoral anti-urease antibody responses (P < 0.001) and reduced the gastric colonization of H. pylori from 7.14 ± 0.95 to 4.68 ± 0.98 log10 CFU g(-1) stomach. This L. lactis oral vaccine offers a promising vaccine candidate for the control of H. pylori infection.",
        "# Title: Development of a new DNA vaccine based on mycobacterial ESAT-6 antigen delivered by recombinant invasive Lactococcus lactis FnBPA+.\n# Abstract: The use of the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis as a vehicle for the oral delivery of DNA vaccine plasmids constitutes a promising strategy for vaccination. The delivery of DNA plasmids into eukaryotic cells is of critical importance for subsequent DNA expression and effectiveness of the vaccine. In this context, the use of the recombinant invasive L. lactis FnBPA+ (fibronectin-binding protein A) strain for the oral delivery of the eukaryotic expression vector vaccination using lactic acid bacteria (pValac), coding for the 6-kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6) gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, could represent a new DNA vaccine strategy against tuberculosis. To this end, the ESAT-6 sequence was cloned into the pValac vector; the L. lactis fibronectin-binding protein A (FnBPA)+ (pValac:ESAT-6) strain was obtained, and its immunological profile was checked in BALB/c mice. This strain was able to significantly increase interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production in spleen cells, showing a systemic T helper 1 (Th1) cell response. The mice also showed a significant increase in specific secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) production in colon tissue and fecal extracts. Thus, this is the first time that L. lactis has been used to deliver a plasmid DNA harboring a gene that encodes an antigen against tuberculosis through mucous membranes.",
        "# Title: Lactococcus lactis displayed neuraminidase confers cross protective immunity against influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Influenza A viruses pose a serious threat to public health. Current influenza A vaccines predominantly focus on hemagglutinin (HA) and show strain-specific protection. Neuraminidase (NA) is much less studied in the context of humoral immunity against influenza A viruses. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cross protective immunity of NA presented on Lactococcus lactis (L.lactis) surface against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in the mouse model. L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA was constructed in which pgsA was used as an anchor protein. Mice vaccinated orally with L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA could elicit significant NA-specific serum IgG and mucosa IgA antibodies, as well as neuraminidase inhibition (NI) titers. Importantly, L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA provided 80% protection against H5N1, 60% protection against H3N2 and H1N1, respectively. These findings suggest that recombinant L.lactis/pNZ110-pgsA-NA in the absence of adjuvant via oral administration can be served as an effective vaccine candidate against diverse strains of influenza A viruses.",
        "# Title: Broadly protective immunity against divergent influenza viruses by oral co-administration of Lactococcus lactis expressing nucleoprotein adjuvanted with cholera toxin B subunit in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines need to be annually reformulated to well match the predicated circulating strains. Thus, it is critical for developing a novel universal influenza vaccine that would be able to confer cross-protection against constantly emerging divergent influenza virus strains. Influenza virus A is a genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses. Influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) is a structural protein which encapsidates the negative strand viral RNA, and anti-NP antibodies play role in cross-protective immunity. Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) is an ideal vaccine delivery vehicle via oral administration route. However, L. lactis vectored vaccine exhibits poor immunogenicity without the use of mucosal adjuvant. To enhance the immunogenicity of L. lactis vectored vaccine, cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit, one of mucosal adjuvants, is a safe adjuvant for oral route, when combined with L. lactis vectored vaccine. In this study, we hypothesized that pNZ8008, a L. lactis expression plasmid, encoding NP antigen, would be able to elicit cross-protection with the use of CTB via oral administration route.",
        "# Title: Cross-protection of Lactococcus lactis-displayed HA2 subunit against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines provide strain-specific protection against homologous subtypes and need to be updated annually. Therefore, it is essential to develop a universal vaccine that would induce broadly cross-protective immunity against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses. The highly conserved HA2 subunit is a promising candidate for developing a universal influenza vaccine. Here, we hypothesized that the HA2 subunit could be displayed on the surface of Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis), using Spax as an anchor protein (L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2) and that L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 would have immunogenicity by oral administration without the use of adjuvant in the mouse model. To address this hypothesis, we show that oral vaccination of mice with L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 elicited significant humoral and mucosal immune responses. Importantly, L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 provided 100% protection against homologous H5N1 or heterologous H1N1 virus challenge. These results suggest that an HA2 subunit presented on the surface of L. lactis is an effective universal vaccine candidate against influenza A viruses in the poultry industry and in humans.",
        "# Title: Oral Immunization with a Recombinant Lactococcus lactis-Expressing HIV-1 Antigen on Group A Streptococcus Pilus Induces Strong Mucosal Immunity in the Gut.\n# Abstract: The induction of a potent humoral and cellular immune response in mucosal tissue is important for the development of an effective HIV vaccine. Most of the current HIV vaccines under development use the i.m. route for immunization, which is relatively poor in generating potent and long-lived mucosal immune responses. In this article, we explore the ability of an oral vaccination with a probiotic organism, Lactococcus lactis, to elicit HIV-specific immune responses in the mucosal and systemic compartments of BALB/c mice. We expressed the HIV-1 Gag-p24 on the tip of the T3 pilus of Streptococcus pyogenes as a fusion to the Cpa protein (LL-Gag). After four monthly LL-Gag oral immunizations, we observed strong Gag-specific IgG and IgA responses in serum, feces, and vaginal secretions. However, the Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses in the blood were at or below our detection limit. After an i.m. modified vaccinia Ankara/Gag boost, we observed robust Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses both in systemic and in mucosal tissues, including intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes of the small intestine, Peyer's patches, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Consistent with strong immunogenicity, the LL-Gag induced activation of CD11c(+) CD11b(+) dendritic cells in the Peyer's patches after oral immunization. Our results demonstrate that oral immunization with L. lactis expressing an Ag on the tip of the group A Streptococcus pilus serves as an excellent vaccine platform to induce strong mucosal humoral and cellular immunity against HIV.",

        "# Title: Production and delivery of Helicobacter pylori NapA in Lactococcus lactis and its protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity.\n# Abstract: Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein A subunit (NapA) has been identified as a virulence factor, a protective antigen and a potent immunomodulator. NapA shows unique application potentials for anti-H. pylori vaccines and treatment strategies of certain allergic diseases and carcinomas. However, appropriate production and utilization modes of NapA still remain uncertain to date. This work has established a novel efficient production and utilization mode of NapA by using L. lactis as an expression host and delivery vector, and demonstrated immune protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity of the engineered L. lactis by oral vaccination of mice. It was observed for the first time that H. pylori NapA promotes both polarized Th17 and Th1 responses, which may greatly affect the clinical application of NapA. This report offers a promising anti-H. pylori oral vaccine candidate and a potent mucosal immune modulatory agent. Meanwhile, it uncovers a way to produce and deliver the oral vaccine and immunomodulator by fermentation of food like milk, which might have striking effects on control of H. pylori infection, gastrointestinal cancers, and Th2 bias allergic diseases, including many food allergies.",
        "# Title: Protective immunity induced by an intranasal multivalent vaccine comprising 10 Lactococcus lactis strains expressing highly prevalent M-protein antigens derived from Group A Streptococcus.\n# Abstract: Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) causes diseases ranging from mild pharyngitis to severe invasive infections. The N-terminal fragment of streptococcal M protein elicits protective antibodies and is an attractive vaccine target. However, this N- terminal fragment is hypervariable: there are more than 200 different M types. In this study, an intranasal live bacterial vaccine comprising 10 strains of Lactococcus lactis, each expressing one N-terminal fragment of M protein, has been developed. Live bacterial-vectored vaccines cost less to manufacture because the processes involved are less complex than those required for production of protein subunit vaccines. Moreover, intranasal administration does not require syringes or specialized personnel. Evaluation of individual vaccine types (M1, M2, M3, M4, M6, M9, M12, M22, M28 and M77) showed that most of them protected mice against challenge with virulent S. pyogenes. All 10 strains combined in a 10-valent vaccine (M×10) induced serum and bronchoalveolar lavage IgG titers that ranged from three- to 10-fold those of unimmunized mice. After intranasal challenge with M28 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice was significantly higher than that of unimmunized mice. In contrast, when mice were challenged with M75 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice did not differ significantly from that of unimmunized mice. Mx-10 immunized mice had significantly less S. pyogenes in oropharyngeal washes and developed less severe disease symptoms after challenge than did unimmunized mice. Our L. lactis-based vaccine may provide an alternative solution to development of broadly protective group A streptococcal vaccines.",
        "# Title: Mucosal and systemic immune responses elicited by recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a fusion protein composed of pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin from Bordetella pertussis.\n# Abstract: We constructed a food-grade expression system harboring a F1S1 fusion protein of Bordetella pertussis to be produced in Lactococcus lactis NZ3900 as a new oral vaccine model against whooping cough, caused by B. pertussis. F1S1 was composed of N-terminally truncated S1 subunit of pertussis toxin and type I immunodominant domain of filamentous hemagglutinin which are both known as protective immunogens against pertussis. The recombinant L. lactis was administered via oral or intranasal routes to BALB/c mice and the related specific systemic and mucosal immune responses were then evaluated. The results indicated significantly higher levels of specific IgA in the lung extracts and IgG in sera of mucosally-immunized mice, compared to their controls. It was revealed that higher levels of IgG2a, compared to IgG1, were produced in all mucosally-immunized mice. Moreover, immunized mice developed Th1 responses with high levels of IFN-γ production by the spleen cells. These findings provide evidence for L. lactis to be used as a suitable vehicle for expression and delivery of F1S1 fusion protein to mucosa and induction of appropriate systemic and mucosal immune responses against pertussis.",
        "# Title: Rotavirus VP6 protein mucosally delivered by cell wall-derived particles from Lactococcus lactis induces protection against infection in a murine model.\n# Abstract: Rotaviruses are the primary cause of acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide. Although the implementation of live attenuated vaccines has reduced the number of rotavirus-associated deaths, variance in their effectiveness has been reported in different countries. This fact, among other concerns, leads to continuous efforts for the development of new generation of vaccines against rotavirus.In this work, we describe the obtention of cell wall-derived particles from a recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a cell wall-anchored version of the rotavirus VP6 protein. After confirming by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, flow cytometry and electronic immunomicroscopy that these particles were carrying the VP6 protein, their immunogenic potential was evaluated in adult BALB/c mice. For that, mucosal immunizations (oral or intranasal), with or without the dmLT [(double mutant Escherichia coli heat labile toxin LT(R192G/L211A)] adjuvant were performed. The results showed that these cell wall-derived particles were able to generate anti-rotavirus IgG and IgA antibodies only when administered intranasally, whether the adjuvant was present or not. However, the presence of dmLT was necessary to confer protection against rotavirus infection, which was evidenced by a 79.5 percent viral shedding reduction.In summary, this work describes the production of cell wall-derived particles which were able to induce a protective immune response after intranasal immunization.

        "# Title: A Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB)-Based Vaccine Candidate for Human Norovirus.\n# Abstract: Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are responsible for more than 95% of the non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis epidemics in the world. The CDC estimates that every year 21 million individuals suffer from HuNoV-induced gastroenteritis in the United States. Currently, there is no FDA-approved vaccine for HuNoVs. Development of an effective vaccine has been hampered by the lack of an efficient cell culture system for HuNoVs and a suitable small animal model for pathogenesis study. In this study, we developed lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as a vector to deliver HuNoV antigen. A LAB strain (Lactococcus lactis) carrying VP1 gene of a HuNoV GII.4 virus (LAB-VP1) was constructed. It was found that HuNoV VP1 protein was highly expressed by LAB vector and was secreted into media supernatants. To test whether LAB-based HuNoV vaccine candidate is immunogenic, 4-day-old gnotobiotic piglets were orally inoculated with various doses of LAB-VP1. It was found that LABs were persistent in the small intestine of piglets and shed in pig feces for at least 25 days post inoculation. LAB DNA and VP1 were detected in mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen tissue in LAB-VP1 inoculated groups. HuNoV-specific IgG and IgA were detectable in serum and feces respectively at day 13 post-inoculation, and further increased at later time points. After being challenged with HuNoV GII.4 strain, a large amount of HuNoV antigens were observed in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum sections of the intestine in the LAB control group. In contrast, significantly less, or no, HuNoV antigens were detected in the LAB-VP1 immunized groups. Collectively, these results demonstrate that a LAB-based HuNoV vaccine induces protective immunity in gnotobiotic piglets.",

        "# Title: Mucosal Vaccination with Lactococcus lactis-Secreting Surface Immunological Protein Induces Humoral and Cellular Immune Protection against Group B Streptococcus in a Murine Model.\n# Abstract: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the primary etiological agent of sepsis and meningitis in newborns and is associated with premature birth and stillbirth. The development of a licensed vaccine is one of the pending challenges for the World Health Organization. Previously, we showed that oral immunization with surface immune protein (SIP) decreases vaginal colonization of GBS and generates functional opsonizing antibodies, which was determined by opsonophagocytic assays (OPA) in vitro. We also showed that the protein has an adjuvant vaccine profile. Therefore, an oral vaccine based on SIP may be an attractive alternative to employ in the development of new vaccines against GBS. Lactococcus lactis is a highlighted oral vaccine probiotic inducer of the mucosal immune response. This bacterium could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of an edible vaccine and has been used in clinical trials. In this study, we showed that an oral vaccine with a recombinant L. lactis strain secreting SIP from GBS (rL. lactis-SIP) can induce protective humoral and cellular immunity in an experimental model of GBS vaginal colonization in C57BL/6 mice. Mice immunized with rL. lactis-SIP were protected against clinical symptoms and bacterial colonization after GBS vaginal colonization. Our rL. lactis-SIP vaccine also induces an increase of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) specifically against SIP. The adoptive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice to naïve mice generated protection against GBS vaginal colonization. Moreover, the rL. lactis-SIP strain induces the activation of SIP-specific T cells, which could decrease GBS vaginal colonization and generate protective antibodies when transferred to other mice. Our experimental observations strongly support the notion that rL. lactis-SIP induces protective humoral and cellular immunity and could be considered as a novel alternative in the development of vaccines for GBS.",
        "# Title: Recombinant Lactococcus Lactis Displaying Omp31 Antigen of Brucella melitensis Can Induce an Immunogenic Response in BALB/c Mice.\n# Abstract: Since Brucella infection mostly occurs through the mucosal surfaces, immune response induced by vaccine that is delivered by a way of mucosal route can be drastically enhanced to control the brucellosis. Omp31is the major outer membrane protein of Brucella, and is considered as a protective antigen against Brucella infection. Accordingly, Lactococcus lactis has been used as an antigen-delivering vector to develop a vaccine-induced mucosal response for having a safer vaccination against brucellosis. A designed omp31 gene fused to the usp45 signal peptide and M6 cell wall anchor was sub cloned in the pNZ7021 expression vector, and a recombinant L. lactis displaying Omp31 was constructed. Omp31 protein expression was confirmed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. Animals were orally and intraperitoneally immunized with live or killed L. lactis expressing Omp31, respectively. The humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated by measuring the specific cytokines and antibodies. sIgA, serum IgA, IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in the mice immunized with live recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31 and also serum IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in mice immunized with killed recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31. Among IgG subtypes, IgG2a response was significantly higher in both groups compared to IgG1. In mice groups immunized with recombinant L. lactis, the IFN-γ and IL-10 level elevated; however, there was no change in the level of IL-4. These results indicated that recombinants L. lactis induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, and also vaccines based on L. lactis-derived live carriers are promising interventions against Brucella melitensis infections.",
        "# Title: Lactococcus lactis FNBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) Induces Cellular and Humoral Immune Responses After Oral Immunization of Mice.\n# Abstract: The development of a new vaccine strategy against tuberculosis is urgently needed and has been greatly encouraged by the scientific community worldwide. In this work, we constructed a lactococcal DNA vaccine based on the fusion of two Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens, ESAT-6 and Ag85A, and examined its immunogenicity. The coding sequences of the ESAT-6 and Ag85A genes were fused and cloned into the eukaryotic expression pValac vector, and the functionality of the vector was confirmed in vitro. Then, L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) was obtained and used for oral immunization of mice. This strain induced significant increases in IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-17 cytokines in stimulated splenocyte cultures, and significant production of antigen-specific sIgA was observed in the colonic tissues of immunized mice. We demonstrated that L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) generated a cellular and humoral immune response after oral immunization of mice. The strategy developed in this work may represent an interesting DNA mucosal vaccine candidate against tuberculosis, using the fusion of two highly immunogenic antigens delivered by safe lactic acid bacteria.",
        "# Title: Protective Immunity Against Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli by Oral Vaccination of Engineered Lactococcus lactis.\n# Abstract: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the leading causes of diarrhea in children globally, and thus suitable vaccines are desired. Antigen display on lactic acid bacteria is a reliable approach for efficient oral vaccination and preventing bowel diseases. To develop an oral vaccine against ETEC, the gene of the binding domain from heat-labile toxin (LTB), a key ETEC virulence factor, was codon-optimized and cloned into a construct containing a signal peptide and an anchor for display on L. lactis. Bioinformatics analysis showed a codon adaptation index of 0.95 for the codon-optimized gene. Cell surface expression of LTB was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and blotting. White New Zealand rabbits were immunized per os (PO) with the recombinant L. lactis, and the antibody titers were assayed with ELISA. In vitro neutralization assay was performed using mouse adrenal tumor cells and rabbit ileal loop test was performed as the in vivo assay. ELISA results indicated that oral administration of the engineered L. lactis elicited a significant production of IgA in the intestine. In vitro neutralization assay showed that the effect of the toxin could be neutralized with 500 µg/ml of IgG isolated from the oral vaccine group. Furthermore, the dose of ETEC causing fluid accumulation in the ileal loop test showed a tenfold increase in rabbits immunized with either recombinant L. lactis or LTB protein compared to other groups. Our results imply that recombinant L. lactis could potentially be an effective live oral vaccine against ETEC toxicity.",
        "# Title: Oral Immunization of Mice with Cell Extracts from Recombinant Lactococcus lactis Expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein.\n# Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all over the world and became a pandemic that named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). At present, several intramuscular vaccines have been successfully developed and mass vaccination has progressed in many countries. The aim of the study is to develop and examine an oral vaccine against COVID-19 with recombinant Lactococcus lactis IL1403, a strain of lactic acid bacteria, expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) S1 subunit as an immunizing antigen. PBS or cell extracts from recombinant L. lactis were orally administered into mice (control VS treatment), and formation of antigen-specific antibodies and changes in the gut microbiome were analyzed. Intracellular antigen was detected, but its secretion was not successful. After immunization, antigen-specific serum IgG and fecal IgA levels were 1.5-fold (P = 0.002) and 1.4-fold (P = 0.016) higher in the immunized mice (treatment) than control, respectively. Gut microbiome profiles were clearly separated between the two groups when analyzed for beta diversity with overall similarity. At the genus level, while Coprococcus (P = 0.036) and unclassified genus of Ruminococcaceae (P = 0.037) in treatment were more abundant than control, rc4-4 (P = 0.013) and Stenotrophomonas (P = 0.021) were less abundant. Our results indicate that cell extract containing SARS-CoV-2 antigen can induce mice to produce antigen-specific antibodies without overall changes in the gut microbiome. This strategy may be useful for the development of other oral viral vaccines.",
        "# Title: Oral Immunization With a M Cell-Targeting Recombinant L. Lactis Vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE Stimulate Protective Immunity Against H. Pylori in Mice.\n# Abstract: There are many virulence factors of H. pylori that contribute in diverse ways to gastric disease. Therefore, designing multivalent epitope vaccines against many key virulence factors virulence factors of H. pylori is a promising strategy to control H. pylori infection. In previous studies, we constructed a multivalent epitope vaccine FVpE against four key virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), and oral immunization with the FVpE vaccine plus a polysaccharide adjuvant (PA) containing lycium barbarum polysaccharide and chitosan could provide protection against H. pylori infection in the Mongolian gerbil model. Oral vaccines have many advantages over injected vaccines, such as improved safety and compliance, and easier manufacturing and administration. However, the harsh gastrointestinal (GI) environment, such as gastric acid and proteolytic enzymes, limits the development of oral vaccines to some extent. Oral vaccines need a gastrointestinal delivery system with high safety, low price and promoting vaccine antigen to stimulate immune response in the gastrointestinal mucosa. Lactic acid bacteria are gastrointestinal probiotics that have unique advantages as a delivery system for oral vaccines. In this study, a M cell-targeting surface display system for L. lactis named plSAM was designed to help vaccine antigens to stimulate effective immune responses in the gastrointestinal tract, and a M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE was constructed by using the surface display system plSAM. recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE could secretively express the SAM-FVpE protein and display it on the bacterial surface. Moreover, experimental results confirmed that LL-plSAM-FVpE had an enhanced M cell-targeting property. In addition, LL-plSAM-FVpE had excellent M cell-targeting property to promote the phagocytosis and transport of the antigen SAM-FVpE by gastrointestinal M cells. More importantly, oral immunization of LL-plSAM-FVpE or SAM-FVpE plus PA can stimulate IgG and sIgA antibodies and CD4+ T cell immune responses against four virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), thus providing protective immunity against H. pylori infection in mice. The M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine against various key H. pylori virulence factors could be a promising vaccine candidate for controlling H. pylori infection.",
        "# Title: Oral and intranasal immunization with food-grade recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing high conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein triggers mice's immunity responses.\n# Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic began at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread throughout the world. Vaccination is still the most effective method of prevention of pathogenic infections, including viral infections. However, there is little evidence that vaccination can protect against SARS-CoV-2 virus for a long time. Thus, regular re-vaccination is necessary to control COVID-19. Vaccination by injection is invasive, and is one of the reasons people refuse to get re-vaccinated. Therefore, we developed a less invasive vaccine based on oral or nasal administration. The gene encoding the high conserved region (HCR) spike protein was inserted into pNZ8149 and expressed in L.lactis NZ3900. Mice were immunized at 3-week intervals with oral or nasal routes. Anti-SARS-CoV2 spike antibody (IgG and IgA) level were measured using ELISA method before and after treatment. Plasma cells population in lymph were analyzed using flowcytometry and the CD4 + and CD8 + cells in lymph and intestine were analyzed using immunofluorescence method. The results of nasal and oral administration in experimental animals showed that L.lactis carrying the HCR gene could induce a humoral immune response, as indicated by increased levels of IgG and IgA against SARS-CoV-2 (IgG/IgA-SARS-CoV-2). The plasma cell population after nasal and oral vaccination in mice were significantly different with control group (p < 0.05). The CD4 + and CD8 + cells in intestine were significantly higher in orally immunized group mice than control group. The CD8 + cells in lymph were significantly higher in intranasal immunized group mice than control group. Our data demonstrate L.lactis expressing spike protein can be developed into a less invasive alternative to nasal and oral vaccination.",
        "# Title: Expanding strain coverage of a group A Streptococcus pilus-expressing Lactococcus lactis mucosal vaccine.\n# Abstract: Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a human pathogenic bacterium that can trigger a wide range of diseases, including the autoimmune diseases acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, causing major morbidity and mortality in many low- and middle-income countries. Primary intervention programs have had limited success thus far, and a licensed vaccine has yet to be developed. The pilus of GAS is known to be involved in host cell adhesion, biofilm formation and immune evasion. We have a mucosal vaccine in development that expresses the pilus of GAS on the surface of the nonpathogenic bacterium Lactococcus lactis. To expand strain coverage, we combined seven L. lactis constructs, each expressing a different GAS pilus variant, and investigated the systemic and mucosal immune responses following immunization. Mice immunized with this combination showed specific immunoglobin G and immunoglobin A responses to the GAS pilus proteins of vaccine strains, at levels comparable to mice immunized with a single construct. Cross-reactivity to pilus proteins of nonvaccine strains was also evident. Furthermore, protective efficacy against a homologous strain of GAS in a murine nasopharyngeal colonization model was observed. Overall, this study provides further evidence for using pilus-expressing lactic acid bacteria as a vaccine to prevent upper respiratory tract GAS infections."

        "# Title: Long non-coding RNA GHET1 promotes gastric carcinoma cell proliferation by increasing c-Myc mRNA stability.\n# Abstract: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a recently characterized class of non-coding RNAs, have been shown to have important regulatory roles and are de-regulated in a variety of tumors. However, the contributions of lncRNAs to gastric carcinoma and their functional mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that lncRNA gastric carcinoma high expressed transcript 1 (lncRNA-GHET1) was up-regulated in gastric carcinoma. The over-expression of this lncRNA correlates with tumor size, tumor invasion and poor survival. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses demonstrated that GHET1 over-expression promotes the proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of GHET1 inhibits the proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells. RNA pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that GHET1 physically associates with insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) and enhances the physical interaction between c-Myc mRNA and IGF2BP1, consequently increasing the stability of c-Myc mRNA and expression. The expression of GHET1 and c-Myc is strongly correlated in gastric carcinoma tissues. Depletion of c-Myc abolishes the effects of GHET1 on proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that GHET1 plays a pivotal role in gastric carcinoma cell proliferation via increasing c-Myc mRNA stability and expression, which suggests potential use of GHET1 for the prognosis and treatment of gastric carcinoma.",

As a result, it is vital to identify novel diagnostic and prognostic marker of bladder cancer. A growing volume of literature has implicated the vital role of long noncoding RNA in the development of cancer. GHET1, a recently identified lncRNA, was initially characterized in gastric cancer. However, its role in bladder cancer remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that GHET1 was upregulated in bladder cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues and its over-expression correlates with tumor size, advanced tumor and lymph node status, and poor survival. GHET1 knockdown suppressed the proliferation and invasion of bladder cancer cells in vitro. In the meantime, inhibition of GHET1 reversed the epithelial-mesenchymal-transition in bladder cancer cell line. Taken together, our study suggests that the potential use of GHET1 as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target of bladder cancer.",

Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) attract much attention of researchers, and they are demonstrated to be dysregulated in a variety of cancers, including HCC. LncRNA gastric carcinoma high expressed transcript 1 lncRNA GHET1 is found to be dysregulated in gastric cancer (GC). However, its clinical value and potential biological function in HCC remains unclear. In this study, the expression level of GHET1 was analyzed in 72 HCC tissues and matched normal tissues by using Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). GHET1 expression was significantly up-regulated in HCC tissues and the higher level of GHET1 was related to vascular invasion, cirrhosis, tumor size, edmindson grade, and poor prognosis. Moreover, knockdown of GHET1 inhibited cell proliferation of HCC, and also caused cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis in HCC cell lines. We also found that GHET1 could epigenetically repress transcription of Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) in HCC cells by recruiting PRC2 into KLF2 promoter region. Our results indicated that lncRNA GHET1, as a growth regulator, might serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and therapy target for HCC.",

However, the function and underlying mechanisms of lncRNA GHET1 in gastric cancer are not fully understood. In this study, the expression of GHET1 was investigated in gastric cancer and it was determined whether GHET1 may potentially be used as a biomarker for the disease. The gastric cancer cell lines MGC‑803 and AGS were transfected with GHET1‑directed small interfering RNA (siRNA) and the changes in phenotype and cell‑cycle‑related molecules were assessed. The downregulation of GHET1 induced G0/G1‑phase arrest in gastric cancer cells and inhibited their proliferation, migration, and invasion. DNA synthesis and the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) decreased, which was consistent with the results of the CCK‑8 assay. The levels of specific cell‑cycle regulators were determined and the expression and activities of positive cell‑cycle regulators (cyclin D, CDK4, CDK6, cyclin E, CDK2) were reduced, whereas those of a negative regulator (P21) were increased in GHET1‑knockdown cells. Taken together, the present findings show that the downregulation of GHET1 not only inhibits the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells, but also inhibits their proliferation, at least in part by upregulating P21 expression and downregulating cyclin and CDK expression to inhibit the G0/G1 to S phase transition. The present findings may provide a potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer."

Four hundred twenty-nine patients had migraine, of which 16.5% reported that headaches could be precipitated by cheese or chocolate, and nearly always both. Of the migraine patients, 18.4% reported sensitivity to all alcoholic drinks, while another 11.8% were sensitive to red wine but not to white wine; 28% of the migrainous patients reported that beer would precipitate headaches. There was a definite statistical association between sensitivity to cheese/chocolate and to red wine (P < 0.001) and also to beer (P < 0.001), but none between diet sensitivity and sensitivity to alcoholic drinks in general. None of 40 patients with tension headache (diagnosed by International Headache Society criteria) reported sensitivity to foods, and only one was sensitive to alcoholic drinks. The prevalence of sensitivity among 46 patients with some migrainous features was intermediate between the migraine and tension headache categories. It is concluded that cheese/chocolate and red wine sensitivity, in particular, have closely related mechanisms, in some way related more to migraine than to more chronic tension-type headache, while quite separate mechanisms play a major role in sensitivity to alcoholic drinks in general.",

A total of 51,383 subjects completed a headache questionnaire and constituted the 'Head-HUNT' Study. Questionnaire-based information on smoking was available in 95% and on alcohol in 89% of the individuals. Associations were assessed in multivariate analyses, estimating prevalence odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Prevalence rates for headache were higher amongst smokers compared with never smokers, most evident for those under 40 years smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.6). Passive smoking was also associated with higher headache prevalence. For alcohol use, there was a tendency of decreasing prevalence of migraine with increasing amounts of alcohol consumption compared with alcohol abstinence. Only with regard to symptoms indicating alcohol overuse, a positive association with frequent headache was found. The association between headache and smoking found in the present study raises questions about a causal relationship, e.g. that smoking causes headache or that it allays stress induced by headache. The observed negative association between migraine and alcohol consumption is probably explained by the headache precipitating properties of alcohol.",

However, the contributions of lncRNAs to gastric carcinoma and their functional mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that lncRNA gastric carcinoma high expressed transcript 1 (lncRNA-GHET1) was up-regulated in gastric carcinoma. The over-expression of this lncRNA correlates with tumor size, tumor invasion and poor survival. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses demonstrated that GHET1 over-expression promotes the proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of GHET1 inhibits the proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells. RNA pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that GHET1 physically associates with insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) and enhances the physical interaction between c-Myc mRNA and IGF2BP1, consequently increasing the stability of c-Myc mRNA and expression. The expression of GHET1 and c-Myc is strongly correlated in gastric carcinoma tissues. Depletion of c-Myc abolishes the effects of GHET1 on proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that GHET1 plays a pivotal role in gastric carcinoma cell proliferation via increasing c-Myc mRNA stability and expression, which suggests potential use of GHET1 for the prognosis and treatment of gastric carcinoma.",

A growing volume of literature has implicated the vital role of long noncoding RNA in the development of cancer. GHET1, a recently identified lncRNA, was initially characterized in gastric cancer. However, its role in bladder cancer remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that GHET1 was upregulated in bladder cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues and its over-expression correlates with tumor size, advanced tumor and lymph node status, and poor survival. GHET1 knockdown suppressed the proliferation and invasion of bladder cancer cells in vitro. In the meantime, inhibition of GHET1 reversed the epithelial-mesenchymal-transition in bladder cancer cell line. Taken together, our study suggests that the potential use of GHET1 as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target of bladder cancer.",

Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) attract much attention of researchers, and they are demonstrated to be dysregulated in a variety of cancers, including HCC. LncRNA gastric carcinoma high expressed transcript 1 lncRNA GHET1 is found to be dysregulated in gastric cancer (GC). However, its clinical value and potential biological function in HCC remains unclear. In this study, the expression level of GHET1 was analyzed in 72 HCC tissues and matched normal tissues by using Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). GHET1 expression was significantly up-regulated in HCC tissues and the higher level of GHET1 was related to vascular invasion, cirrhosis, tumor size, edmindson grade, and poor prognosis. Moreover, knockdown of GHET1 inhibited cell proliferation of HCC, and also caused cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis in HCC cell lines. We also found that GHET1 could epigenetically repress transcription of Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) in HCC cells by recruiting PRC2 into KLF2 promoter region. Our results indicated that lncRNA GHET1, as a growth regulator, might serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and therapy target for HCC.",

In the present study, the expression patterns of GHET1 in HNC were determined and its clinical significance was assessed. The expression level of GHET1 was significantly increased in HNC tissues, compared with paired adjacent normal tissues. High GHET1 expression was significantly associated with advanced Tumor-Node-Metastasis stages and poor prognosis.

However, the function and underlying mechanisms of lncRNA GHET1 in gastric cancer are not fully understood. In this study, the expression of GHET1 was investigated in gastric cancer and it was determined whether GHET1 may potentially be used as a biomarker for the disease. The gastric cancer cell lines MGC‑803 and AGS were transfected with GHET1‑directed small interfering RNA (siRNA) and the changes in phenotype and cell‑cycle‑related molecules were assessed. The downregulation of GHET1 induced G0/G1‑phase arrest in gastric cancer cells and inhibited their proliferation, migration, and invasion. DNA synthesis and the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) decreased, which was consistent with the results of the CCK‑8 assay. The levels of specific cell‑cycle regulators were determined and the expression and activities of positive cell‑cycle regulators (cyclin D, CDK4, CDK6, cyclin E, CDK2) were reduced, whereas those of a negative regulator (P21) were increased in GHET1‑knockdown cells. Taken together, the present findings show that the downregulation of GHET1 not only inhibits the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells, but also inhibits their proliferation, at least in part by upregulating P21 expression and downregulating cyclin and CDK expression to inhibit the G0/G1 to S phase transition. The present findings may provide a potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer."

The median injected activity of 18F-rhPSMA-7 was 327 MBq (range, 132-410 MBq), with a median uptake time of 79.5 min (range, 60-153 min). All patients underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection. The presence of lymph node metastases was determined by an experienced reader independently for both the PET and the morphologic datasets using a template-based analysis on a 5-point scale. Patient-level and template-based results were both compared with histopathologic findings. Results: Lymph node metastases were present in 18 patients (31.0%) and were located in 52 of 375 templates (13.9%). Receiver-operating-characteristic analyses showed 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET to perform significantly better than morphologic imaging on both patient-based and template-based analyses (areas under curve, 0.858 vs. 0.649 [P = 0.012] and 0.765 vs. 0.589 [P < 0.001], respectively). On patient-based analyses, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET were 72.2%, 92.5%, and 86.2%, respectively, and those of morphologic imaging were 50.0%, 72.5%, and 65.5%, respectively. On template-based analyses, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET were 53.8%, 96.9%, and 90.9%, respectively, and those of morphologic imaging were 9.6%, 95.0%, and 83.2%, respectively. Conclusion:18F-rhPSMA-7 PET is superior to morphologic imaging for N-staging of high-risk primary PC. The efficacy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 is similar to published data for 68Ga-PSMA-11.",

On the basis of clinical results, 18F-PSMA-1007 is a promising PSMA PET tracer, but detailed histologic confirmation has been lacking. Methods: Ninety-six patients with prostate cancer underwent 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT followed by either radical prostatectomy with lymphadenectomy or salvage lymphadenectomy. The histologic findings of PSMA PET-positive nodes were analyzed retrospectively. A lesion-based and patient-based analysis was performed comparing all positive lesions and only lesions larger than 3 mm on histopathology. Results: Of the patients, 90.6% received 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT for staging before the primary treatment, whereas 9.4% underwent imaging for biochemical recurrence. In 34.4% of the cohort, positive lymph nodes were present on imaging. In total, 1,746 lymph nodes were dissected in 96 patients. 18F-PSMA-1007 PET had a lesion-based sensitivity of 81.7%, a specificity of 99.6%, a positive predictive value of 92.4%, and a negative predictive value of 98.9% for detecting positive lymph nodes larger than 3 mm. In the analysis of all malignant nodes regardless of size, the overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value on lesion-based analysis were 71.2%, 99.5%, 91.3%, and 97.9%, respectively. The patient-based analysis showed a sensitivity of 85.9% and a specificity of 99.5% for lymph nodes larger than 3 mm. Conclusion:18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT reliably detects malignant lymph nodes and has an exceptional specificity of more than 99% for nodal metastases.",

Discard rates for SCDs were ascertained. The relative risk of graft loss was similar for recipients of SCD kidneys with sCr of 1.6-2.0 and >2.0 mg/dL, compared to </=1.5 mg/dL. For ECD recipients, the relative risk of graft failure significantly increased with increasing sCr. Of potential SCDs, the adjusted risk of discard was higher with sCr >2.0 mg/dL (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 7.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.5-7.6) and 1.6-2.0 mg/dL (AOR 2.7; CI 2.5-2.9) relative to sCr </=1.5 mg/dL.

We performed a multicenter study to determine associations of AKI (increasing admission-to-terminal serum creatinine by AKI Network stages) with kidney discard, delayed graft function (DGF) and 6-month estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). In 1632 donors, kidney discard risk increased for AKI stages 1, 2 and 3 (compared to no AKI) with adjusted relative risks of 1.28 (1.08-1.52), 1.82 (1.45-2.30) and 2.74 (2.0-3.75), respectively. Adjusted relative risk for DGF also increased by donor AKI stage: 1.27 (1.09-1.49), 1.70 (1.37-2.12) and 2.25 (1.74-2.91), respectively. Six-month eGFR, however, was similar across AKI categories but was lower for recipients with DGF (48 [interquartile range: 31-61] vs. 58 [45-75] ml/min/1.73m(2) for no DGF, p < 0.001). There was significant favorable interaction between donor AKI and DGF such that 6-month eGFR was progressively better for DGF kidneys with increasing donor AKI (46 [29-60], 49 [32-64], 52 [36-59] and 58 [39-71] ml/min/1.73m(2) for no AKI, stage 1, 2 and 3, respectively; interaction p = 0.05).

We included all patients who received deceased donor kidney transplant from June 2004 to October 2013. There were 162 AKI donor transplant recipients (21% of deceased donor transplants): 139 in the standard criteria donor (SCD) and 23 in the expanded criteria donor (ECD) cohort. 71% of the AKI donors had stage 3 (severe AKI), based on acute kidney injury network (AKIN) staging. Protocol biopsies were done at 1, 4, and 12 months posttransplant. One and four month formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies from 48 patients (24 AKI donors, 24 non-AKI) underwent global gene expression profiling using DNA microarrays (96 arrays). DGF was more common in the AKI group but eGFR, graft survival at 1 year and proportion with IF/TA>2 at 1 year were similar for the two groups. At 1 month, there were 898 differentially expressed genes in the AKI group (p-value <0.005; FDR <10%), but by 4 months there were no differences. Transplanting selected kidneys from deceased donors with AKI is safe and has excellent outcomes.",

        "# Title: Transplantation of Kidneys From Donors With Acute Kidney Injury: Friend or Foe?\n# Abstract: The gap between supply and demand in kidney transplantation has led to increased use of marginal kidneys; however, kidneys with acute kidney injury are often declined/discarded. To determine whether this policy is justified, we analyzed outcomes of donor kidneys with acute kidney injury (AKI) in a large UK cohort. A retrospective analysis of the UK Transplant Registry evaluated deceased donors between 2003 and 2013. Donors were classified as no AKI, or AKI stage 1-3 according to Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Relationship of AKI with delayed graft function/primary nonfunction (DGF/PNF), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and graft-survival at 90 days and 1 year was analyzed. There were 11 219 kidneys (1869 [17%] with AKI) included. Graft failure at 1 year is greater for donors with AKI than for those without (graft survival 89% vs. 91%, p = 0.02; odds ratio (OR) 1.20 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.41]). DGF rates increase with donor AKI stage (p < 0.005), and PNF rates are significantly higher for AKIN stage 3 kidneys (9% vs. 4%, p = 0.04) Analysis of association between AKI and recipient eGFR suggests a risk of inferior eGFR with AKI versus no AKI (p < 0.005; OR 1.25 [95% CI: 1.08-1.31]). We report a small reduction in 1-year graft-survival of kidneys from donors with AKI. We conclude that AKI stage 1 or 2 kidneys should be used; however, caution is advised for AKI stage 3 donors.",

We aimed to evaluate the impact of donors' AKI severity and trend on graft outcomes in DDK transplantation. This was a retrospective study of DDK transplantation performed from 2005 to 2014. Based on maximum and terminal serum creatinine values before transplantation, the AKI trends were categorized as improving or worsening. Of 413 DDKs, 275 developed AKI: 177 stage 1, 52 stage 2, and 46 stage 3. DDKs with AKI had 212 improving AKI and 63 worsening AKI. Graft outcomes were similar based on AKI stage. Worsening AKI did not affect delayed graft function development; however, it significantly elevated graft failure risk even after adjusting for AKI stage and Kidney Donor Risk Index. Graft survival of the improving group was similar to DDKs with no AKI. This study showed that AKI severity of DDKs did not affect overall graft outcomes. Notably, DDKs with improving AKI showed a similar graft survival rate to DDKs without AKI, although worsening AKI had a worse prognosis. Consideration of the AKI trend, rather than its severity, is needed when DDKs with AKI are allocated.",
        "# Title: Deceased-donor acute kidney injury is not associated with kidney allograft failure.\n# Abstract: Deceased-donor acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with organ discard and delayed graft function, but data on longer-term allograft survival are limited. We performed a multicenter study to determine associations between donor AKI (from none to severe based on AKI Network stages) and all-cause graft failure, adjusting for donor, transplant, and recipient factors. We examined whether any of the following factors modified the relationship between donor AKI and graft survival: kidney donor profile index, cold ischemia time, donation after cardiac death, expanded-criteria donation, kidney machine perfusion, donor-recipient gender combinations, or delayed graft function. We also evaluated the association between donor AKI and a 3-year composite outcome of all-cause graft failure or estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 in a subcohort of 30% of recipients. Among 2,430 kidneys transplanted from 1,298 deceased donors, 585 (24%) were from donors with AKI. Over a median follow-up of 4.0 years, there were no significant differences in graft survival by donor AKI stage. We found no evidence that pre-specified variables modified the effect of donor AKI on graft survival. In the subcohort, donor AKI was not associated with the 3-year composite outcome. Donor AKI was not associated with graft failure in this well-phenotyped cohort. Given the organ shortage, the transplant community should consider measures to increase utilization of kidneys from deceased donors with AKI.",
        "# Title: Success of kidney transplantations from deceased donors with acute kidney injury.\n# Abstract: BACKGROUND The acceptance of organs from deceased donors with acute kidney injury (AKI) varies considerably, with uncertain outcomes. The current organ shortage has led to increased use of marginal donor organs. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective, single-center study included 642 patients who underwent kidney allograft transplantation between 2005 and 2016. The recipients were categorized into 3 groups: AKI-1 (n=214), comprising donors with a peak serum creatinine (SCr) level of 1.1-2.0 mg/dl; AKI-2 (n=89), comprising donors with a peak SCr level >2 mg/dl; and non-AKI (n=339), comprising donors with normal kidney function (SCr <1.1 mg/dl). RESULTS The cumulative survival rates for patients and grafts did not significantly differ among the AKI-1, AKI-2, and non-AKI groups at the 1-year (91.6%/79.4%, 92.1%/83.1%, 95.3%/88.5%, respectively) and 5-year assessments (79.4%/67.8%, 86.8%/71.7%, 80.5%/71.1%, respectively). These findings were corroborated by mean SCr values and estimated glomerular filtration rates at the 1-year (2.08±1.7/51.16±23.45, 2.01±1.52/56.46±23.63, 1.81±1.13/55.44±23.26 mg/dl, respectively) and 5-year assessments (1.91±1.28/51.06±24.65, 1.74±0.66/57.44±31.21, 1.7±0.88/58.56±26.04 mg/dl, respectively). The incidence of delayed graft function in each group was 29.9%, 44.9%, and 28.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Kidney transplantation from donors with AKI, although associated with a higher rate of delayed graft function, results in good long-term transplant survival and reliable kidney functionality after 5 years. The inclusion of donors with AKI may widely extend the pool of available organs; however, careful donor selection is necessary.",

We investigated the effect of donor AKI on renal function and chronic changes on protocol biopsies at 1-year post-transplant. Donor AKI was defined according to Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Between 2013 and 2017, 333 kidneys were transplanted and subsequently biopsied after 1 year. Fifty-three kidneys from AKI donors (AKIN stage I n = 42, stage II n = 8, stage III n = 3) were compared to 280 kidneys from non-AKI donors. At 1-year follow-up, patient and graft survival were comparable. Donor AKI was not predictive of IFTA (Banff interstitial fibrosis plus tubular atrophy scores) at 1-year post-transplant biopsy (2.10 ± 1.28 in AKI, 2.09 ± 1.22 in non-AKI, P = .95). Donor AKI was also not associated with progression of IFTA from 3 to 12 months (P = .69), or inferior glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, P = .94). In a multivariate analysis, the odds of IFTA >2 were comparable between AKI and non-AKI groups. In conclusion, the transplantation of kidneys from donors with predominantly stage I AKI results in comparable function and degree of fibrosis on protocol biopsies 1-year post-transplant. Selected grafts from donors with AKI are a valuable tool for expanding the donor pool for kidney transplantation.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate how kidney transplantation (KT) from a donor with AKI affects long-term graft survival in various situations. All patients who underwent KT from DBD donors between June 2003 and April 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. The KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) criteria were used to classify donor AKI. The cohort included 376 donors (no AKI group, n = 117 [31.1%]; AKI group n = 259 [68.9%]). Death-censored graft survival was similar according to the presence of AKI, AKI severity, and the AKI trend (p = 0.929, p = 0.077, and p = 0.658, respectively). Patients whose donors had AKI who received using low dose (1.5 mg/kg for three days) rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (r-ATG) as the induction agent had significantly superior death-censored graft survival compared with patients in that group who received basiliximab (p = 0.039). AKI in DBD donors did not affect long-term death-censored graft survival. Low-dose r-ATG may be considered as an induction immunosuppression in recipients receiving kidneys with AKI because it showed better graft survival than basiliximab.",

        "# Title: Outcomes and factors leading to graft failure in kidney transplants from deceased donors with acute kidney injury-A retrospective cohort study.\n# Abstract: Due to shortage of donor, kidney transplants (KTs) from donors with acute kidney injury (AKI) are expanding. Although previous studies comparing clinical outcomes between AKI and non-AKI donors in KTs have shown comparable results, data on high-volume analysis of KTs outcomes with AKI donors are limited. This study aimed to analyze the selection trends of AKI donors and investigate the impact of AKI on graft failure using the United states cohort data. We analyzed a total 52,757 KTs collected in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipient (SRTR) from 2010 to 2015. The sample included 4,962 (9.4%) cases of KTs with AKI donors (creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dL). Clinical characteristics of AKI and non-AKI donors were analyzed and outcomes of both groups were compared. We also analyzed risk factors for graft failure in AKI donor KTs. Although the incidence of delayed graft function was higher in recipients of AKI donors compared to non-AKI donors, graft and patient survival were not significantly different between the two groups. We found donor hypertension, cold ischemic time, the proportion of African American donors, and high KDPI were risk factors for graft failure in AKI donor KTs. KTs from deceased donor with AKI showed comparable outcomes. Thus, donors with AKI need to be considered more actively to expand donor pool. Caution is still needed when donors have additional risk factors of graft failure.",

        "# Title: Outcome of kidney transplantations from ≥65-year-old deceased donors with acute kidney injury.\n# Abstract: Kidney transplantation (KT) from donors with acute kidney injury (AKI) has been associated with delayed graft function (DGF) but similar graft survival compared with KT from donors without AKI. Kidneys from ≥65-year-old donors with comorbidities are more susceptible to cold ischemia time (CIT) and DGF and it is unknown whether such elderly kidneys with AKI can also be transplanted with satisfactory outcomes. All KTs from ≥65-year-old donors performed at our center from 1999 to 2019 (n = 233) were retrospectively analyzed and short- as well as long-term outcomes were compared for KTs from donors with (n = 64) and without AKI (n = 169). There were no significant differences regarding the frequency of DGF as well as the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 1 and 3 years post-transplant between the no-AKI and the AKI group (DGF: no-AKI 30.2% vs. AKI 40.6%, P = .17; eGFR at 1-year: 31.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 vs. 35.5 ml/min/1.73 m2 , P = .32; at 3-years: 33.8 ml/min/1.73 m2 vs. 40.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 , P = .18; respectively). Death-censored graft survival and patient survival were also not significantly different. Multivariable Cox regression analysis did not identify AKI as a significant risk factor for graft loss or death. Following careful donor and recipient selection, kidneys from ≥65-year-old AKI donors may potentially be transplanted with satisfactory outcomes.",

The current study analyzed the clinical significance of this new stage in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Subjects and Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 4045 eligible PTC patients. The patients were divided into four groups according to the extent of ETE: no ETE, ETE into perithyroidal tissue, T3b (ETE into the strap muscles), and ETE beyond the strap muscles. Differences in the clinical characteristics and prognosis of the four groups were assessed. Results: Of these 4045 patients, 2300 (56.9%) had no ETE, 1004 (24.8%) had ETE into perithyroidal tissue, 371 (9.2%) had ETE into the strap muscles, and 370 (9.1%) had ETE beyond the strap muscles. Tumor size, multifocality, lymph node metastasis (LNM), distant metastasis (DM), recurrence, and recurrence-free survival (RFS) between patients with ETE into perithyroidal tissue and patients without ETE did not show differences, but significant differences were observed between patients with T3b and patients without ETE, and only patients with ETE beyond the strap muscles had significantly worse overall survival (OS) than the other three groups.

The definition of minimal extrathyroidal extension (mETE) has been recently revised. The presence of mETE does not impact mortality and is generally not considered to be a predictor for the risk of recurrence. This study aimed at comparing the risk of recurrence and the response to therapy of PTC with mETE and gross extrathyroidal extension (ETE) into the strap muscles (gETE) with low- and intermediate-risk PTC without ETE (low risk w/o ETE and intermediate risk w/o ETE, respectively) to further characterize the impact of ETE on outcomes. Methods: A total of 596 PTCs were analyzed according to the degree of ETE as well as other predictors of recurrence. Four groups of patients were compared, low risk w/o ETE (n = 251), intermediate risk w/o ETE (n = 89), mETE (n = 191), and gETE (n = 65), to determine the risk of recurrence and the response to treatment. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate associations between groups and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: The risk of recurrence was 3% in low risk w/o ETE PTC, 14% in intermediate risk w/o ETE, 14% in mETE, and 25% in gETE. The recurrence risk was increased by the presence of ETE (odds ratio [OR] = 2.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-5.85, p = 0.005) and lymph node metastases (OR = 2.44 [95% CI 1.25-4.76], p = 0.009). Patients with low-risk carcinomas w/o ETE experienced longer DFS than those with mETE (hazard ratio = 0.08 [95% CI 0.02-0.28], p < 0.001), but no significant difference was observed between intermediate risk w/o ETE, mETE, and gETE. In terms of the response to therapy, patients with gETE had higher rates of biochemical and/or structural incomplete responses within the first year of treatment (OR = 2.68 [95% CI 1.31-5.45], p = 0.007) and at the final follow-up evaluation (OR = 4.35 [95% CI 1.99-9.51], p < 0.001) compared with those with mETE. An analysis of the subgroups of microcarcinomas without lymph node metastases revealed no significant difference in DFS or the response to therapy between the low risk w/o ETE and mETE PTC groups. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that both mETE and gETE are independent risk factors for the risk of recurrence in PTC. Although gETE has a more pronounced impact on the recurrence risk and is associated with a worse response to therapy, mETE may not be associated with a low risk of recurrence. This observation suggests that patients with PTC and mETE may, in part, have an intermediate risk of recurrence and need to be followed accordingly."

In 1632 donors, kidney discard risk increased for AKI stages 1, 2 and 3 (compared to no AKI) with adjusted relative risks of 1.28 (1.08-1.52), 1.82 (1.45-2.30) and 2.74 (2.0-3.75), respectively. Adjusted relative risk for DGF also increased by donor AKI stage: 1.27 (1.09-1.49), 1.70 (1.37-2.12) and 2.25 (1.74-2.91), respectively. Six-month eGFR, however, was similar across AKI categories but was lower for recipients with DGF (48 [interquartile range: 31-61] vs. 58 [45-75] ml/min/1.73m(2) for no DGF, p < 0.001). There was significant favorable interaction between donor AKI and DGF such that 6-month eGFR was progressively better for DGF kidneys with increasing donor AKI (46 [29-60], 49 [32-64], 52 [36-59] and 58 [39-71] ml/min/1.73m(2) for no AKI, stage 1, 2 and 3, respectively; interaction p = 0.05).

One and four month formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies from 48 patients (24 AKI donors, 24 non-AKI) underwent global gene expression profiling using DNA microarrays (96 arrays). DGF was more common in the AKI group but eGFR, graft survival at 1 year and proportion with IF/TA>2 at 1 year were similar for the two groups. At 1 month, there were 898 differentially expressed genes in the AKI group (p-value <0.005; FDR <10%), but by 4 months there were no differences. Transplanting selected kidneys from deceased donors with AKI is safe and has excellent outcomes.",

        "# Title: Transplantation of Kidneys From Donors With Acute Kidney Injury: Friend or Foe?\n# Abstract: The gap between supply and demand in kidney transplantation has led to increased use of marginal kidneys; however, kidneys with acute kidney injury are often declined/discarded. To determine whether this policy is justified, we analyzed outcomes of donor kidneys with acute kidney injury (AKI) in a large UK cohort. A retrospective analysis of the UK Transplant Registry evaluated deceased donors between 2003 and 2013. Donors were classified as no AKI, or AKI stage 1-3 according to Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Relationship of AKI with delayed graft function/primary nonfunction (DGF/PNF), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and graft-survival at 90 days and 1 year was analyzed. There were 11 219 kidneys (1869 [17%] with AKI) included. Graft failure at 1 year is greater for donors with AKI than for those without (graft survival 89% vs. 91%, p = 0.02; odds ratio (OR) 1.20 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.41]). DGF rates increase with donor AKI stage (p < 0.005), and PNF rates are significantly higher for AKIN stage 3 kidneys (9% vs. 4%, p = 0.04) Analysis of association between AKI and recipient eGFR suggests a risk of inferior eGFR with AKI versus no AKI (p < 0.005; OR 1.25 [95% CI: 1.08-1.31]). We report a small reduction in 1-year graft-survival of kidneys from donors with AKI. We conclude that AKI stage 1 or 2 kidneys should be used; however, caution is advised for AKI stage 3 donors.",

We aimed to evaluate the impact of donors' AKI severity and trend on graft outcomes in DDK transplantation. This was a retrospective study of DDK transplantation performed from 2005 to 2014. Based on maximum and terminal serum creatinine values before transplantation, the AKI trends were categorized as improving or worsening. Of 413 DDKs, 275 developed AKI: 177 stage 1, 52 stage 2, and 46 stage 3. DDKs with AKI had 212 improving AKI and 63 worsening AKI. Graft outcomes were similar based on AKI stage. Worsening AKI did not affect delayed graft function development; however, it significantly elevated graft failure risk even after adjusting for AKI stage and Kidney Donor Risk Index. Graft survival of the improving group was similar to DDKs with no AKI. This study showed that AKI severity of DDKs did not affect overall graft outcomes. Notably, DDKs with improving AKI showed a similar graft survival rate to DDKs without AKI, although worsening AKI had a worse prognosis. Consideration of the AKI trend, rather than its severity, is needed when DDKs with AKI are allocated.",
        "# Title: Deceased-donor acute kidney injury is not associated with kidney allograft failure.\n# Abstract: Deceased-donor acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with organ discard and delayed graft function, but data on longer-term allograft survival are limited. We performed a multicenter study to determine associations between donor AKI (from none to severe based on AKI Network stages) and all-cause graft failure, adjusting for donor, transplant, and recipient factors. We examined whether any of the following factors modified the relationship between donor AKI and graft survival: kidney donor profile index, cold ischemia time, donation after cardiac death, expanded-criteria donation, kidney machine perfusion, donor-recipient gender combinations, or delayed graft function. We also evaluated the association between donor AKI and a 3-year composite outcome of all-cause graft failure or estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 in a subcohort of 30% of recipients. Among 2,430 kidneys transplanted from 1,298 deceased donors, 585 (24%) were from donors with AKI. Over a median follow-up of 4.0 years, there were no significant differences in graft survival by donor AKI stage. We found no evidence that pre-specified variables modified the effect of donor AKI on graft survival. In the subcohort, donor AKI was not associated with the 3-year composite outcome. Donor AKI was not associated with graft failure in this well-phenotyped cohort. Given the organ shortage, the transplant community should consider measures to increase utilization of kidneys from deceased donors with AKI.",
        "# Title: Success of kidney transplantations from deceased donors with acute kidney injury.\n# Abstract: BACKGROUND The acceptance of organs from deceased donors with acute kidney injury (AKI) varies considerably, with uncertain outcomes. The current organ shortage has led to increased use of marginal donor organs. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective, single-center study included 642 patients who underwent kidney allograft transplantation between 2005 and 2016. The recipients were categorized into 3 groups: AKI-1 (n=214), comprising donors with a peak serum creatinine (SCr) level of 1.1-2.0 mg/dl; AKI-2 (n=89), comprising donors with a peak SCr level >2 mg/dl; and non-AKI (n=339), comprising donors with normal kidney function (SCr <1.1 mg/dl). RESULTS The cumulative survival rates for patients and grafts did not significantly differ among the AKI-1, AKI-2, and non-AKI groups at the 1-year (91.6%/79.4%, 92.1%/83.1%, 95.3%/88.5%, respectively) and 5-year assessments (79.4%/67.8%, 86.8%/71.7%, 80.5%/71.1%, respectively). These findings were corroborated by mean SCr values and estimated glomerular filtration rates at the 1-year (2.08±1.7/51.16±23.45, 2.01±1.52/56.46±23.63, 1.81±1.13/55.44±23.26 mg/dl, respectively) and 5-year assessments (1.91±1.28/51.06±24.65, 1.74±0.66/57.44±31.21, 1.7±0.88/58.56±26.04 mg/dl, respectively). The incidence of delayed graft function in each group was 29.9%, 44.9%, and 28.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Kidney transplantation from donors with AKI, although associated with a higher rate of delayed graft function, results in good long-term transplant survival and reliable kidney functionality after 5 years. The inclusion of donors with AKI may widely extend the pool of available organs; however, careful donor selection is necessary.",

We investigated the effect of donor AKI on renal function and chronic changes on protocol biopsies at 1-year post-transplant. Donor AKI was defined according to Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Between 2013 and 2017, 333 kidneys were transplanted and subsequently biopsied after 1 year. Fifty-three kidneys from AKI donors (AKIN stage I n = 42, stage II n = 8, stage III n = 3) were compared to 280 kidneys from non-AKI donors. At 1-year follow-up, patient and graft survival were comparable. Donor AKI was not predictive of IFTA (Banff interstitial fibrosis plus tubular atrophy scores) at 1-year post-transplant biopsy (2.10 ± 1.28 in AKI, 2.09 ± 1.22 in non-AKI, P = .95). Donor AKI was also not associated with progression of IFTA from 3 to 12 months (P = .69), or inferior glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, P = .94). In a multivariate analysis, the odds of IFTA >2 were comparable between AKI and non-AKI groups. In conclusion, the transplantation of kidneys from donors with predominantly stage I AKI results in comparable function and degree of fibrosis on protocol biopsies 1-year post-transplant. Selected grafts from donors with AKI are a valuable tool for expanding the donor pool for kidney transplantation.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate how kidney transplantation (KT) from a donor with AKI affects long-term graft survival in various situations. All patients who underwent KT from DBD donors between June 2003 and April 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. The KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) criteria were used to classify donor AKI. The cohort included 376 donors (no AKI group, n = 117 [31.1%]; AKI group n = 259 [68.9%]). Death-censored graft survival was similar according to the presence of AKI, AKI severity, and the AKI trend (p = 0.929, p = 0.077, and p = 0.658, respectively). Patients whose donors had AKI who received using low dose (1.5 mg/kg for three days) rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (r-ATG) as the induction agent had significantly superior death-censored graft survival compared with patients in that group who received basiliximab (p = 0.039).

Although previous studies comparing clinical outcomes between AKI and non-AKI donors in KTs have shown comparable results, data on high-volume analysis of KTs outcomes with AKI donors are limited. This study aimed to analyze the selection trends of AKI donors and investigate the impact of AKI on graft failure using the United states cohort data. We analyzed a total 52,757 KTs collected in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipient (SRTR) from 2010 to 2015. The sample included 4,962 (9.4%) cases of KTs with AKI donors (creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dL). Clinical characteristics of AKI and non-AKI donors were analyzed and outcomes of both groups were compared. We also analyzed risk factors for graft failure in AKI donor KTs. Although the incidence of delayed graft function was higher in recipients of AKI donors compared to non-AKI donors, graft and patient survival were not significantly different between the two groups. We found donor hypertension, cold ischemic time, the proportion of African American donors, and high KDPI were risk factors for graft failure in AKI donor KTs. KTs from deceased donor with AKI showed comparable outcomes. Thus, donors with AKI need to be considered more actively to expand donor pool. Caution is still needed when donors have additional risk factors of graft failure.",

Positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]FDDNP and the determination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of these proteins constitute a means to visualize in vivo Aβ and tau brain accumulation. Information about longitudinal changes of these CSF and PET biomarkers in PD with regard to progression to dementia is lacking. We assessed the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of CSF and PET biomarkers of tau and Aβ with PD-related cognitive dysfunction in 6 healthy-controls (HC), 16 patients with PD without dementia (PDND), and 8 PD with dementia (PDD). All subjects underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing, [18F]FDDNP PET, and CSF Aβ-tau determination. After 18 months, the PDND group was re-assessed clinically and by neuropsychological, PET, and CSF determinations. Cross-sectionally, PDD had higher [18F]FDDNP binding in lateral temporal regions and lower levels of CSF Aβ levels compared to PDND, with a congruent correlation between the [18F]FDDNP binding and CSF Aβ levels. Longitudinally, higher baseline lateral temporal [18F]FDDNP binding was associated to longitudinal worsening in cognitive performances and progression to dementia among subjects classified as PDND at baseline, who additionally disclosed at follow-up an increase in lateral-temporal FDDNP binding, as well as a reduction in CSF Aβ and an increase in CSF tau levels.

While many parkinsonian disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia, and multiple system atrophy are classified as synucleinopathies, progressive supranuclear palsy is coined a tauopathy due to the aggregation of pathological tau in the brain. [18F]AV-1451 (also known as [18F]-T807) is a positron emission tomography radiotracer that binds to paired helical filaments of tau in Alzheimer's disease. We investigated whether [18F]AV-1451 could be used as biomarker for the diagnosis and disease progression monitoring in progressive supranuclear palsy. Six progressive supranuclear palsy, six Parkinson's disease, and 10 age-matched healthy controls were recruited. An anatomical MRI and a 90-min PET scan, using [18F]AV-1451, were acquired from all participants.

[18F]AV-1451 is a positron emission tomography radiotracer designed to bind pathological tau. A post-mortem study using [18F]AV-1451 discovered off-target binding properties to neuromelanin in the substantia nigra. A subsequent clinical study reported a 30% decrease in [18F]AV-1451 binding in the midbrain of PD patients. A total of 12 patients and 10 healthy age-matched controls were recruited. An anatomical MRI and a 90-min PET scan, using [18F]AV-1451, were acquired from all participants. The standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) from 60 to 90 min post-injection was calculated for the substantia nigra, using the cerebellar cortex as the reference region. The substantia nigra was delineated using automated region of interest software. An independent samples ANOVA and LSD post hoc testing were used to test for differences in [18F]AV-1451 SUVR between groups. Substantia nigra SUVR from 60 to 90 min was significantly greater in HC compared to both PSP and PD groups. Although the PD group had the lowest SUVR, there was no significant difference in substantia nigra uptake between PD and PSP. [18F]AV-1451 may be the first PET radiotracer capable of imaging neurodegeneration of the substantia nigra in parkinsonisms.

We therefore wanted to study the retention patterns of 18F-AV-1451 in PD, PD-dementia (PDD), and DLB. To do this 44 healthy controls, 11 non-demented patients with PD, 18 patients with PDD, and six patients with DLB underwent MRI and 18F-AV-1451 PET scanning and cognitive testing. We found that parietal 18F-AV-1451 retention was increased in patients with DLB compared to controls and PD patients, while 18F-AV-1451 uptake was reduced in the substantia nigra in PDD. Increased parietal 18F-AV-1451 PET uptake was associated with impaired performance on verbal fluency tests, and the decreased uptake in the substantia nigra correlated with worse motor function. We found no effect of the monoamine oxidase B inhibitor rasagiline on 18F-AV-1451 binding. In conclusion DLB patients have increased parietal 18F-AV-1451 uptake. Increased parietal tau is associated with executive impairment in patients with synucleinopathies, while decreased uptake in the substantia nigra is associated with parkinsonism.

Due to the overlap of signs and symptoms a precise differentiation is often difficult, especially early in the disease course. Enormous efforts have been taken to develop tau-selective PET imaging agents, but strong off-target binding to monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) has been observed across first generation ligands. Nonetheless, astrogliosis-related MAO-B elevation is a common histopathological known feature of all parkinsonian syndromes and might be itself an interesting imaging target.

[18F]-THK5351 PET was performed in 34 patients: six with Parkinson's disease (PD), nine with multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P), six with MSA with predominant cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C), and 13 with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) Richardson's syndrome. Volume-of-interest-based quantification of standardized-uptake-values was conducted in different parkinsonian syndrome-related target regions. PET results were subjected to multinomial logistic regression to create a prediction model discriminating among groups. Furthermore, we correlated tracer uptake with clinical findings. Elevated [18F]-THK5351 uptake in midbrain and diencephalon differentiated PSP patients from PD and MSA-C. MSA-C patients were distinguishable by high tracer uptake in the pons and cerebellar deep white matter when compared to PSP and PD patients, whereas MSA-P patients tended to show higher tracer uptake in the lentiform nucleus. A multinomial logistic regression classified 33/34 patients into the correct clinical diagnosis group. Tracer uptake in the pons, cerebellar deep white matter, and striatum was closely associated with the presence of cerebellar and parkinsonian symptoms of MSA patients. The current study demonstrates that combined MAO-B and tau binding of THK5351 facilitates differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes. Furthermore, our data indicate a correlation of MSA phenotype with [18F]-THK5351 uptake in certain brain regions, illustrating their relevance for the emergence of clinical symptoms and underlining the potential of THK5351 PET as a biomarker that correlates with pathological changes as well as with disease stage.",

Positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]FDDNP and the determination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of these proteins constitute a means to visualize in vivo Aβ and tau brain accumulation. Information about longitudinal changes of these CSF and PET biomarkers in PD with regard to progression to dementia is lacking. We assessed the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of CSF and PET biomarkers of tau and Aβ with PD-related cognitive dysfunction in 6 healthy-controls (HC), 16 patients with PD without dementia (PDND), and 8 PD with dementia (PDD). All subjects underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing, [18F]FDDNP PET, and CSF Aβ-tau determination. After 18 months, the PDND group was re-assessed clinically and by neuropsychological, PET, and CSF determinations. Cross-sectionally, PDD had higher [18F]FDDNP binding in lateral temporal regions and lower levels of CSF Aβ levels compared to PDND, with a congruent correlation between the [18F]FDDNP binding and CSF Aβ levels. Longitudinally, higher baseline lateral temporal [18F]FDDNP binding was associated to longitudinal worsening in cognitive performances and progression to dementia among subjects classified as PDND at baseline, who additionally disclosed at follow-up an increase in lateral-temporal FDDNP binding, as well as a reduction in CSF Aβ and an increase in CSF tau levels. These results confirm the relevance of these CSF and PET biomarkers to PDD, being specifically the first to show [18F]FDDNP PET as a dementia risk biomarker in PD, along with longitudinal CSF and PET changes over time.",
        "# Title: Positron emission tomography imaging of tau pathology in progressive supranuclear palsy.\n# Abstract: Progressive supranuclear palsy is a rare form of atypical Parkinsonism that differs neuropathologically from other parkinsonian disorders. While many parkinsonian disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia, and multiple system atrophy are classified as synucleinopathies, progressive supranuclear palsy is coined a tauopathy due to the aggregation of pathological tau in the brain. [18F]AV-1451 (also known as [18F]-T807) is a positron emission tomography radiotracer that binds to paired helical filaments of tau in Alzheimer's disease. We investigated whether [18F]AV-1451 could be used as biomarker for the diagnosis and disease progression monitoring in progressive supranuclear palsy. Six progressive supranuclear palsy, six Parkinson's disease, and 10 age-matched healthy controls were recruited. An anatomical MRI and a 90-min PET scan, using [18F]AV-1451, were acquired from all participants. The standardized uptake value ratio from 60 to 90 min post-injection was calculated in each region of interest, using the cerebellar cortex as a reference region. No significant differences in standardized uptake value ratios were detected in our progressive supranuclear palsy group compared to the two control groups. [18F]AV-1451 may bind selectivity to the paired helical filaments in Alzheimer's disease, which differ from the straight conformation of tau filaments in progressive supranuclear palsy.",

[18F]AV-1451 is a positron emission tomography radiotracer designed to bind pathological tau. A post-mortem study using [18F]AV-1451 discovered off-target binding properties to neuromelanin in the substantia nigra. A subsequent clinical study reported a 30% decrease in [18F]AV-1451 binding in the midbrain of PD patients. A total of 12 patients and 10 healthy age-matched controls were recruited. An anatomical MRI and a 90-min PET scan, using [18F]AV-1451, were acquired from all participants. The standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) from 60 to 90 min post-injection was calculated for the substantia nigra, using the cerebellar cortex as the reference region. The substantia nigra was delineated using automated region of interest software. An independent samples ANOVA and LSD post hoc testing were used to test for differences in [18F]AV-1451 SUVR between groups. Substantia nigra SUVR from 60 to 90 min was significantly greater in HC compared to both PSP and PD groups. Although the PD group had the lowest SUVR, there was no significant difference in substantia nigra uptake between PD and PSP. [18F]AV-1451 may be the first PET radiotracer capable of imaging neurodegeneration of the substantia nigra in parkinsonisms. Further testing must be done in PD and atypical parkinsonian disorders to support this off-target use of [18F]AV-1451.",

We therefore wanted to study the retention patterns of 18F-AV-1451 in PD, PD-dementia (PDD), and DLB. To do this 44 healthy controls, 11 non-demented patients with PD, 18 patients with PDD, and six patients with DLB underwent MRI and 18F-AV-1451 PET scanning and cognitive testing. We found that parietal 18F-AV-1451 retention was increased in patients with DLB compared to controls and PD patients, while 18F-AV-1451 uptake was reduced in the substantia nigra in PDD. Increased parietal 18F-AV-1451 PET uptake was associated with impaired performance on verbal fluency tests, and the decreased uptake in the substantia nigra correlated with worse motor function. We found no effect of the monoamine oxidase B inhibitor rasagiline on 18F-AV-1451 binding. In conclusion DLB patients have increased parietal 18F-AV-1451 uptake. Increased parietal tau is associated with executive impairment in patients with synucleinopathies, while decreased uptake in the substantia nigra is associated with parkinsonism. Further, our data indicate that 18F-AV-1451 does not significantly bind to MAO-B in vivo.",

Due to the overlap of signs and symptoms a precise differentiation is often difficult, especially early in the disease course. Enormous efforts have been taken to develop tau-selective PET imaging agents, but strong off-target binding to monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) has been observed across first generation ligands.

The current study analyzed the clinical significance of this new stage in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Subjects and Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 4045 eligible PTC patients. The patients were divided into four groups according to the extent of ETE: no ETE, ETE into perithyroidal tissue, T3b (ETE into the strap muscles), and ETE beyond the strap muscles. Differences in the clinical characteristics and prognosis of the four groups were assessed. Results: Of these 4045 patients, 2300 (56.9%) had no ETE, 1004 (24.8%) had ETE into perithyroidal tissue, 371 (9.2%) had ETE into the strap muscles, and 370 (9.1%) had ETE beyond the strap muscles. Tumor size, multifocality, lymph node metastasis (LNM), distant metastasis (DM), recurrence, and recurrence-free survival (RFS) between patients with ETE into perithyroidal tissue and patients without ETE did not show differences, but significant differences were observed between patients with T3b and patients without ETE, and only patients with ETE beyond the strap muscles had significantly worse overall survival (OS) than the other three groups. However, T3b did not independently predict worse RFS in univariable and multivariable analyses. Conclusions: T3b, distinguished from minimal ETE, may be related to larger tumor size, higher prevalence of multifocality, LNM, DM, recurrence, and worse RFS than no ETE, but it may not affect OS and may not independently predict recurrence in PTC patients.",
        "# Title: Is There a Difference Between Minimal and Gross Extension into the Strap Muscles for the Risk of Recurrence in Papillary Thyroid Carcinomas?\n# Abstract: Background: The morbidity of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is primarily related to locoregional recurrences and distant metastases. The definition of minimal extrathyroidal extension (mETE) has been recently revised. The presence of mETE does not impact mortality and is generally not considered to be a predictor for the risk of recurrence. This study aimed at comparing the risk of recurrence and the response to therapy of PTC with mETE and gross extrathyroidal extension (ETE) into the strap muscles (gETE) with low- and intermediate-risk PTC without ETE (low risk w/o ETE and intermediate risk w/o ETE, respectively) to further characterize the impact of ETE on outcomes. Methods: A total of 596 PTCs were analyzed according to the degree of ETE as well as other predictors of recurrence. Four groups of patients were compared, low risk w/o ETE (n = 251), intermediate risk w/o ETE (n = 89), mETE (n = 191), and gETE (n = 65), to determine the risk of recurrence and the response to treatment. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate associations between groups and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: The risk of recurrence was 3% in low risk w/o ETE PTC, 14% in intermediate risk w/o ETE, 14% in mETE, and 25% in gETE. The recurrence risk was increased by the presence of ETE (odds ratio [OR] = 2.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-5.85, p = 0.005) and lymph node metastases (OR = 2.44 [95% CI 1.25-4.76], p = 0.009). Patients with low-risk carcinomas w/o ETE experienced longer DFS than those with mETE (hazard ratio = 0.08 [95% CI 0.02-0.28], p < 0.001), but no significant difference was observed between intermediate risk w/o ETE, mETE, and gETE. In terms of the response to therapy, patients with gETE had higher rates of biochemical and/or structural incomplete responses within the first year of treatment (OR = 2.68 [95% CI 1.31-5.45], p = 0.007) and at the final follow-up evaluation (OR = 4.35 [95% CI 1.99-9.51], p < 0.001) compared with those with mETE. An analysis of the subgroups of microcarcinomas without lymph node metastases revealed no significant difference in DFS or the response to therapy between the low risk w/o ETE and mETE PTC groups. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that both mETE and gETE are independent risk factors for the risk of recurrence in PTC. Although gETE has a more pronounced impact on the recurrence risk and is associated with a worse response to therapy, mETE may not be associated with a low risk of recurrence. This observation suggests that patients with PTC and mETE may, in part, have an intermediate risk of recurrence and need to be followed accordingly."

This single-center study was conducted to assess the accuracy of SWE in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), in comparison with transient elastography (TE), by using liver biopsy (LB) as the reference standard. Consecutive patients with CHC scheduled for LB by referring physicians were studied. One hundred and twenty-one patients met inclusion criteria. On the same day, real-time SWE using the ultrasound (US) system, Aixplorer (SuperSonic Imagine S.A., Aix-en-Provence, France), TE using FibroScan (Echosens, Paris, France), and US-assisted LB were consecutively performed. Fibrosis was staged according to the METAVIR scoring system.

The rate of reliable liver stiffness measurements was significantly higher with 2-D SWE than with TE: 99.2% versus 74.8%, p < 0.0001 (different reliability criteria used, according to current recommendations). In univariate analysis, liver stiffness measured with 2-D SWE correlated best with fibrosis stage estimated with TE (r = 0.699, p < 0.0001), followed by Forns score (r = 0.534, p < 0.0001) and King's score (r = 0.512, p < 0.0001). However, in multivariate analysis, only 2-D SWE-measured values remained correlated with fibrosis stage (p < 0.0001).

It can evaluate larger regions of interest and, therefore, might be better at determining the overall fibrosis distribution. The aim of this prospective study was to compare 2-D SWE with the two best evaluated liver elastography methods, transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse (point SWE using acoustic radiation force impulse) imaging, in the same population group. The study included 132 patients with chronic hepatopathies, in which liver stiffness was evaluated using transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging and 2-D SWE. The reference methods were liver biopsy for the assessment of liver fibrosis (n = 101) and magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography for the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis (n = 31). No significant difference in diagnostic accuracy, assessed as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), was found between the three elastography methods (2-D SWE, transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging) for the diagnosis of significant and advanced fibrosis and liver cirrhosis in the \"per protocol\" (AUROCs for fibrosis stages ≥2: 0.90, 0.95 and 0.91; for fibrosis stage [F] ≥3: 0.93, 0.95 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.92, 0.96 and 0.92) and \"intention to diagnose\" cohort (AUROCs for F ≥2: 0.87, 0.92 and 0.91; for F ≥3: 0.91, 0.93 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.88, 0.90 and 0.89).

Calculations of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) were performed and compared for the staging of liver fibrosis. AUROC for SSI, FibroScan, and ARFI were 0.86, 0.82, and 0.77 for diagnoses of ≥F2; 0.89, 0.86, and 0.84 for ≥F3; and 0.88, 0.87, and 0.84 for F4, respectively. SSI had a higher accuracy than ARFI for diagnoses of significant fibrosis (≥F2) (P = 0.004). Clinical factors related to obesity such as body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2) , waist circumference ≥102 cm or increased parietal wall thickness were associated with LSM failures when using SSI or FibroScan and with unreliable results when using ARFI. In univariate analysis, FibroScan values were slightly correlated with NAFLD activity score and steatosis (R = 0.28 and 0.22, respectively), whereas SSI and ARFI were not; however, these components of NAFLD did not affect LSM results in multivariate analysis. The cutoff values for SSI and FibroScan for staging fibrosis with a sensitivity ≥90% were very close: 6.3/6.2 kPa for ≥F2, 8.3/8.2 kPa for ≥F3, and 10.5/9.5 kPa for F4.",

Patients with CHB infection who underwent liver biopsy were consecutively included. After exclusions, 257 patients were analyzed. Two-dimensional SWE resulted in a significantly higher rate of reliable measurements (98.1%, 252/257) than TE (93.0%, 239/257) (p = 0.011). Liver stiffness measurements of the two examinations exhibited a strong correlation (r = 0.835, p < 0.001).

The purpose of this study was to perform an intra-individual comparison between 2-D shear wave elastography (2-D-SWE with a GE system) and Virtual Touch Tissue Quantification (VTTQ with a Siemens system) to assess whether these can be used interchangeably to grade fibrosis. Ninety-three patients (51 men, 42 women; mean age, 54 y) with liver disease of various etiologies (hepatitis B virus = 47, hepatitis C virus = 22; alcohol = 6, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis = 5, other = 13) were included. Using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values, liver fibrosis was classified into clinically non-significant (F0/F1) and significant (≥F2) fibrosis. Results indicated that intra-modality repeatability was excellent for both techniques (GE 2-D-SWE: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.89 [0.84-0.93]; VTTQ: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.90 [0.86-0.93]). Intra-modality classification agreement for fibrosis grading was good to excellent (GE 2-D-SWE: κ = 0.65, VTTQ: κ = 0.82). However, inter-modality agreement for fibrosis grading was only fair (κ = 0.31) using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values of fibrosis. In conclusion, although both GE 2-D-SWE and Siemens VTTQ exhibit good to excellent intra-modality repeatability, inter-modality agreement is only fair, suggesting that these should not be used interchangeably.",

      "referenceConclusion": "The complete explanation of the genomic background behind melanoma pathogenesis remains elusive. This study presents a summary of current understanding regarding the clonal relatedness of mutated genes in primary cutaneous melanoma and matched tumors. We draw attention to the knowledge gap regarding the genetic heterogeneity of melanoma-specific genes, which could serve as a valuable tool in identifying suitable patients for trials testing possible new targeted therapies. Furthermore, we found that CM presents a significant concordance in BRAF status between primary and metastatic tumors than in previous meta-analyses, probably due to technical advances, although a minority of patients showed inconsistencies. Therefore, we propose that molecular testing in metastatic tissue is a more appropriate method for determining BRAF status to tailor the treatment decision, although it is still reasonable to use the primary tumor in cases of difficulty. Further research should investigate the factors causing these discrepancies and the feasibility of using other molecular markers with BRAF status to better stratify patients for melanoma treatment.",

        "# Title: Intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity of BRAF(V600E))mutations in primary and metastatic melanoma.\n# Abstract: The rationale for using small molecule inhibitors of oncogenic proteins as cancer therapies depends, at least in part, on the assumption that metastatic tumors are primarily clonal with respect to mutant oncogene. With the emergence of BRAF(V600E) as a therapeutic target, we investigated intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity in melanoma using detection of the BRAF(V600E) mutation as a marker of clonality. BRAF mutant-specific PCR (MS-PCR) and conventional sequencing were performed on 112 tumors from 73 patients, including patients with matched primary and metastatic specimens (n = 18). Nineteen patients had tissues available from multiple metastatic sites. Mutations were detected in 36/112 (32%) melanomas using conventional sequencing, and 85/112 (76%) using MS-PCR. The better sensitivity of the MS-PCR to detect the mutant BRAF(V600E) allele was not due to the presence of contaminating normal tissue, suggesting that the tumor was comprised of subclones of differing BRAF genotypes. To determine if tumor subclones were present in individual primary melanomas, we performed laser microdissection and mutation detection via sequencing and BRAF(V600E)-specific SNaPshot analysis in 9 cases. Six of these cases demonstrated differing proportions of BRAF(V600E)and BRAF(wild-type) cells in distinct microdissected regions within individual tumors. Additional analyses of multiple metastatic samples from individual patients using the highly sensitive MS-PCR without microdissection revealed that 5/19 (26%) patients had metastases that were discordant for the BRAF(V600E) mutation. In conclusion, we used highly sensitive BRAF mutation detection methods and observed substantial evidence for heterogeneity of the BRAF(V600E) mutation within individual melanoma tumor specimens, and among multiple specimens from individual patients. Given the varied clinical responses of patients to BRAF inhibitor therapy, these data suggest that additional studies to determine possible associations between clinical outcomes and intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity could prove fruitful.",

        "# Title: Discordancy in BRAF mutations among primary and metastatic melanoma lesions: clinical implications for targeted therapy.\n# Abstract: Systemic targeted molecular therapy, in the form of a selective BRAF inhibitor with or without a MEK inhibitor, is a standard treatment for patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma with unresectable stage III and IV disease. Patients with BRAF mutation-negative primary tumors may manifest BRAF mutation-positive metastatic disease. It is unclear whether all metastatic lesions carry the same BRAF mutation status found in the primary tumor and if discordancy exists, in what frequency it occurs. Primary and matched metastatic lesions in 25 melanoma patients were tested for the BRAF V600E/Ec, V600K, V600D, and V600R mutations using a BRAF RGQ PCR kit (Qiagen). Four patients (16%) had discrepancies between their primary and metastatic melanoma BRAF status. Of these patients, 2 (8%) had BRAF mutation-positive primary melanomas with BRAF mutation-negative metastatic lesions and 2 (8%) patient had BRAF mutation-negative melanoma with a BRAF mutation-positive metastatic lesion. In summary, discordancy of BRAF mutation status is not an infrequent finding between primary and metastatic melanoma. It may be prudent in previously negative patients to determine BRAF mutation status of new metastatic tumors for proper allocation of BRAF inhibitor therapy. Discordant BRAF status may have a role in the varying patterns of response and inevitable resistance seen with BRAF inhibitor therapies.",

Nevertheless, BRAF oncogene mutation status between different samples from the same patient has been studied with conflicting results. This study investigated the intrapatient homogeneity of BRAF mutation status using pyrosequencing in primary tumors and different metastatic sites of melanoma patients. Paired samples of lymphatic, visceral, and subcutaneous metastases and primary melanoma from 45 metastatic melanoma patients were tested for BRAF mutations using a pyrosequencing assay and by Sanger sequencing. Overall, sequencing for BRAF mutation status was performed in 114 paired samples from 45 patients. Eighteen patients (40%) carried a BRAF mutation, including BRAF V600E (12/18), BRAF V600K (5/18), and BRAF V600R (1/18) mutations. Multiple BRAF mutations (V600E and V600K) were found in one patient. Among the patients with BRAF mutations, a good agreement in BRAF mutation status was found between the first and second tumor samples genotyped (91%; Cohen's κ coefficient: 0.81). Discordance in BRAF mutation status was found only in four patients, involving all three patients in whom sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases were sampled. These SLNs exhibited a wild-type genotype and were discordant with the other BRAF-mutated samples found in the same patient. The intrapatient BRAF status was predominantly homogeneous. However, SLN genotyping using pyrosequencing might be inaccurate in determining the actual mutation status of melanoma. Further studies are required to confirm the lack of reliability of SLN.",

Treatment with BRAFV600 inhibitors has improved overall and disease-free survival in metastatic melanoma patients whose tumors harbor BRAFV600 mutations. Although the BRAFV600E mutation appears to have a critical role in tumor initiation, its expression during tumor progression remains controversial. In fact, various authors claim that BRAFV600E heterogeneity is evident in melanoma tumors. Herein, we investigated the pattern of BRAFV600E expression in matched primary and metastatic samples from 140 patients. Using a combination of real-time PCR and immunohistochemical analyses, we demonstrated that BRAFV600E expression is homogeneous in melanoma tumors and hypothesized that the heterogeneity described by others might be attributable to technical issues when molecular methods are used.

BRAF mutation frequency ranges from 40 to 60% depending on melanoma clinical characteristics and detection technique used.Intertumoral heterogeneity could lead to misinterpretation of BRAF mutational status; this is especially important if testing is performed on primary specimens, when metastatic lesions are unavailable.Aim of this study was to identify the best combination of methods for detecting BRAF mutations (among peptide nucleic acid - PNA-clamping real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and capillary sequencing) and investigate BRAF mutation heterogeneity in a series of 100 primary melanomas and a subset of 25 matched metastatic samples.Overall, we obtained a BRAF mutation frequency of 62%, based on the combination of at least two techniques. Concordance between mutation status in primary and metastatic tumor was good but not complete (67%), when agreement of at least two techniques were considered. Next generation sequencing was used to quantify the threshold of detected mutant alleles in discordant samples. Combining different methods excludes that the observed heterogeneity is technique-based. We propose an algorithm for BRAF mutation testing based on agreement between immunohistochemistry and PNA; a third molecular method could be added in case of discordance of the results. Testing the primary tumor when the metastatic sample is unavailable is a good option if at least two methods of detection are used, however the presence of intertumoral heterogeneity or the occurrence of additional primaries should be carefully considered.",

Between 40% and 60% of melanomas demonstrate BRAF mutations, BRAF V600E being most common. Selective BRAF inhibitor therapy has shown improvement in outcome in patients with melanoma. It has been demonstrated that not all metastatic lesions carry the same BRAF mutation status as the primary, but the frequency in which discordance occurs remains unclear. Establishing this may have implications in the use of BRAF inhibitors in patients with melanoma brain metastases.Patients who underwent metastectomy for melanoma brain metastases were identified using our local histopathology database. A review of histology of the primary lesion and the metastasis was performed for each patient, assessing for BRAF mutation status discordance.Fourty-two patients who underwent a brain metastectomy following excision of a melanoma primary were identified over a 7-year period. Median survival was 9 months. The median Breslow thickness for the primary lesion was 3.4 mm. Six patients (14%) had discrepancy between the BRAF status of a melanoma primary and metastatic lesion. Of these 6 patients, 3 had a BRAF mutation positive primary with a BRAF mutation negative metastatic lesion, while the other 3 had a BRAF mutation negative primary with BRAF mutation positive metastasis.There is an important discordance rate in the BRAF mutation status of melanoma primaries versus brain metastases.",

Given this, the objective of the current study was to ascertain concordance of somatic mutations in BRAF/NRAS/TERT and immunohistochemical PD-L1 and CD8 in matched primary cutaneous and metastatic melanoma. A total of 43 archival paired samples with sufficient material for genetic and immunohistochemical analyses met the criteria for inclusion in the study. Immunohistochemistry was performed for PD-L1 and CD8 and direct-DNA Sanger sequencing for BRAF/NRAS/TERT promoter mutational analyses. Agreement between paired samples was assessed using Cohen κ. Poor concordance among primary and corresponding metastases was noted in BRAF (9/42 cases discordant, κ = 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.77; P = .0013), TERT promoter mutations (13/41 cases discordant, κ = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.04-0.62; P = .033), tumoral PD-L1 immunoexpression (9/43 cases discordant, κ = 0.39; 95% CI, 0.07-0.72; P = .0099), and immunoexpression of CD8+ T lymphocytes (12/43 cases discordant, κ = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.19-0.69; P = .002). Although NRAS1 and NRAS2 were highly concordant (42/43 and 39/43 cases, respectively), discordant NRAS2 mutational status was associated with a median time to metastasis of 90 versus 455 days for pairs with concordant status (P = .07).

        "# Title: Immunohistochemical and Molecular Features of Melanomas Exhibiting Intratumor and Intertumor Histomorphologic Heterogeneity.\n# Abstract: Melanoma is a heterogeneous neoplasm at the histomorphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular levels. Melanoma with extreme histomorphologic heterogeneity can pose a diagnostic challenge in which the diagnosis may predominantly rely on its immunophenotypic profile. However, tumor survival and response to therapy are linked to tumor genetic heterogeneity rather than tumor morphology. Therefore, understating the molecular characteristics of such melanomas become indispensable. In this study, DNA was extracted from 11 morphologically distinct regions in eight formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded melanomas. In each region, mutations in 50 cancer-related genes were tested using next-generation sequencing (NGS). A tumor was considered genetically heterogeneous if at least one non-overlapping mutation was identified either between the histologically distinct regions of the same tumor (intratumor heterogeneity) or among the histologically distinct regions of the paired primary and metastatic tumors within the same patient (intertumor heterogeneity). Our results revealed that genetic heterogeneity existed in all tumors as non-overlapping mutations were detected in every tested tumor (n = 5, 100%; intratumor: n = 2, 40%; intertumor: n = 3, 60%). Conversely, overlapping mutations were also detected in all the tested regions (n = 11, 100%). Melanomas exhibiting histomorphologic heterogeneity are often associated with genetic heterogeneity, which might contribute to tumor survival and poor response to therapy.",

High consistency was observed between immunostaining and molecular methods for BRAFV600E (k = 0.90; p < 0.001) and NRASQ61R (k = 0.87; p < 0.001).

As the potential heterogeneity of BRAF mutations in melanoma has been reported, accurate detection of BRAF mutations are important. However, the genetic heterogeneity of acral melanoma-a distinct type of melanoma with a unique genetic background-has not fully been investigated. We conducted a retrospective review of our acral melanoma patients. Of the 196 patients with acral melanoma, we retrieved 31 pairs of primary and matched metastatic melanomas. We immunostained the 31 pairs with VE1, a BRAFV600E-mutation-specific monoclonal antibody. Immunohistochemistry with VE1 showed a high degree of sensitivity and specificity for detecting BRAFV600E mutations compared with the real-time polymerase chain reaction method. A total of nine primary (29.0%) and eight metastatic (25.8%) acral melanomas were positive for VE1. In three patients (9.7%), we observed a discordance of VE1 staining between the primary and metastatic lesions. Of note, VE1 immunohistochemical staining revealed a remarkable degree of intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity in acral melanoma. Our study reveals that VE1 immunostaining is a useful ancillary method for detecting BRAFV600E mutations in acral melanoma and allows for a clear visualization of intra- and inter-tumor BRAF heterogeneity.",
        "# Title: TERT, BRAF, and NRAS Mutational Heterogeneity between Paired Primary and Metastatic Melanoma Tumors.\n# Abstract: Mutational heterogeneity can contribute to therapeutic resistance in solid cancers. In melanoma, the frequencies of intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity are controversial. We examined mutational heterogeneity within individual patients with melanoma using multiplatform analysis of commonly mutated driver and nonpassenger genes. We analyzed paired primary and metastatic tumors from 60 patients and multiple metastatic tumors from 39 patients whose primary tumors were unavailable (n = 271 tumors). We used a combination of multiplex SNaPshot assays, Sanger sequencing, mutation-specific PCR, or droplet digital PCR to determine the presence of BRAFV600, NRASQ61, TERT-124C>T, and TERT-146C>T mutations. Mutations were detected in BRAF (39%), NRAS (21%), and/or TERT (78%). Thirteen patients had TERTmutant discordant tumors; seven of these had a single tumor with both TERT-124C>T and TERT-146C>T mutations present at different allele frequencies. Two patients had both BRAF and NRAS mutations; one had different tumors and the other had a single tumor with both mutations. One patient with a BRAFmutant primary lacked mutant BRAF in at least one of their metastases. Overall, we identified mutational heterogeneity in 18 of 99 patients (18%). These results suggest that some primary melanomas may be composed of subclones with differing mutational profiles. Such heterogeneity may be relevant to treatment responses and survival outcomes."

        "conclusionA": "Based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of multiple studies, **BRAF mutation status exhibits significant heterogeneity between primary and metastatic melanoma lesions in a substantial proportion of patients (ranging from 13% to 40% discordance across studies), with discordancy rates reported between 8% and 16% in specific cohorts.** This inter-tumor heterogeneity may occur even when primary tumors appear homogeneous and has implications for targeted therapy, potentially requiring re-evaluation of BRAF status in metastatic sites, particularly in patients initially testing negative. While generally observed as homogeneous, evidence of intra-tumor heterogeneity within individual primary or metastatic lesions has also been documented, suggesting the presence of subclones with differing BRAF genotypes.",
        "conclusionB": "Based on the analysis of provided research context concerning genetic concordance in primary cutaneous melanoma (PCM) and matched metastases:\n\n**Primary Concluding Statement:**\n\nWhile primary cutaneous melanoma and matched metastatic lesions generally exhibit high genetic concordance (exceeding 90%), reflecting a common clonal origin, significant discordance exists, driven by intratumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution under selective pressures. This genetic discordance, particularly concerning alterations like *CDKN2A* and *TP53*, is associated with clinically significant implications, including treatment resistance and potentially poorer outcomes, underscoring the necessity of considering the genetic profile of metastatic disease for optimal patient management."

Four hundred twenty-nine patients had migraine, of which 16.5% reported that headaches could be precipitated by cheese or chocolate, and nearly always both. Of the migraine patients, 18.4% reported sensitivity to all alcoholic drinks, while another 11.8% were sensitive to red wine but not to white wine; 28% of the migrainous patients reported that beer would precipitate headaches. There was a definite statistical association between sensitivity to cheese/chocolate and to red wine (P < 0.001) and also to beer (P < 0.001), but none between diet sensitivity and sensitivity to alcoholic drinks in general. None of 40 patients with tension headache (diagnosed by International Headache Society criteria) reported sensitivity to foods, and only one was sensitive to alcoholic drinks. The prevalence of sensitivity among 46 patients with some migrainous features was intermediate between the migraine and tension headache categories. It is concluded that cheese/chocolate and red wine sensitivity, in particular, have closely related mechanisms, in some way related more to migraine than to more chronic tension-type headache, while quite separate mechanisms play a major role in sensitivity to alcoholic drinks in general.",

A total of 51,383 subjects completed a headache questionnaire and constituted the 'Head-HUNT' Study. Questionnaire-based information on smoking was available in 95% and on alcohol in 89% of the individuals. Associations were assessed in multivariate analyses, estimating prevalence odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Prevalence rates for headache were higher amongst smokers compared with never smokers, most evident for those under 40 years smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.6). Passive smoking was also associated with higher headache prevalence. For alcohol use, there was a tendency of decreasing prevalence of migraine with increasing amounts of alcohol consumption compared with alcohol abstinence. Only with regard to symptoms indicating alcohol overuse, a positive association with frequent headache was found. The association between headache and smoking found in the present study raises questions about a causal relationship, e.g. that smoking causes headache or that it allays stress induced by headache. The observed negative association between migraine and alcohol consumption is probably explained by the headache precipitating properties of alcohol.",

A retrospective analysis of the UK Transplant Registry evaluated deceased donors between 2003 and 2013. Donors were classified as no AKI, or AKI stage 1-3 according to Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Relationship of AKI with delayed graft function/primary nonfunction (DGF/PNF), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and graft-survival at 90 days and 1 year was analyzed. There were 11 219 kidneys (1869 [17%] with AKI) included.

DGF rates increase with donor AKI stage (p < 0.005), and PNF rates are significantly higher for AKIN stage 3 kidneys (9% vs. 4%, p = 0.04) Analysis of association between AKI and recipient eGFR suggests a risk of inferior eGFR with AKI versus no AKI (p < 0.005; OR 1.25 [95% CI: 1.08-1.31]).

We aimed to evaluate the impact of donors' AKI severity and trend on graft outcomes in DDK transplantation. This was a retrospective study of DDK transplantation performed from 2005 to 2014. Based on maximum and terminal serum creatinine values before transplantation, the AKI trends were categorized as improving or worsening. Of 413 DDKs, 275 developed AKI: 177 stage 1, 52 stage 2, and 46 stage 3. DDKs with AKI had 212 improving AKI and 63 worsening AKI. Graft outcomes were similar based on AKI stage. Worsening AKI did not affect delayed graft function development; however, it significantly elevated graft failure risk even after adjusting for AKI stage and Kidney Donor Risk Index. Graft survival of the improving group was similar to DDKs with no AKI. This study showed that AKI severity of DDKs did not affect overall graft outcomes. Notably, DDKs with improving AKI showed a similar graft survival rate to DDKs without AKI, although worsening AKI had a worse prognosis. Consideration of the AKI trend, rather than its severity, is needed when DDKs with AKI are allocated.",
        "# Title: Deceased-donor acute kidney injury is not associated with kidney allograft failure.\n# Abstract: Deceased-donor acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with organ discard and delayed graft function, but data on longer-term allograft survival are limited. We performed a multicenter study to determine associations between donor AKI (from none to severe based on AKI Network stages) and all-cause graft failure, adjusting for donor, transplant, and recipient factors. We examined whether any of the following factors modified the relationship between donor AKI and graft survival: kidney donor profile index, cold ischemia time, donation after cardiac death, expanded-criteria donation, kidney machine perfusion, donor-recipient gender combinations, or delayed graft function. We also evaluated the association between donor AKI and a 3-year composite outcome of all-cause graft failure or estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 in a subcohort of 30% of recipients. Among 2,430 kidneys transplanted from 1,298 deceased donors, 585 (24%) were from donors with AKI. Over a median follow-up of 4.0 years, there were no significant differences in graft survival by donor AKI stage. We found no evidence that pre-specified variables modified the effect of donor AKI on graft survival. In the subcohort, donor AKI was not associated with the 3-year composite outcome. Donor AKI was not associated with graft failure in this well-phenotyped cohort. Given the organ shortage, the transplant community should consider measures to increase utilization of kidneys from deceased donors with AKI.",
        "# Title: Success of kidney transplantations from deceased donors with acute kidney injury.\n# Abstract: BACKGROUND The acceptance of organs from deceased donors with acute kidney injury (AKI) varies considerably, with uncertain outcomes. The current organ shortage has led to increased use of marginal donor organs. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective, single-center study included 642 patients who underwent kidney allograft transplantation between 2005 and 2016. The recipients were categorized into 3 groups: AKI-1 (n=214), comprising donors with a peak serum creatinine (SCr) level of 1.1-2.0 mg/dl; AKI-2 (n=89), comprising donors with a peak SCr level >2 mg/dl; and non-AKI (n=339), comprising donors with normal kidney function (SCr <1.1 mg/dl). RESULTS The cumulative survival rates for patients and grafts did not significantly differ among the AKI-1, AKI-2, and non-AKI groups at the 1-year (91.6%/79.4%, 92.1%/83.1%, 95.3%/88.5%, respectively) and 5-year assessments (79.4%/67.8%, 86.8%/71.7%, 80.5%/71.1%, respectively). These findings were corroborated by mean SCr values and estimated glomerular filtration rates at the 1-year (2.08±1.7/51.16±23.45, 2.01±1.52/56.46±23.63, 1.81±1.13/55.44±23.26 mg/dl, respectively) and 5-year assessments (1.91±1.28/51.06±24.65, 1.74±0.66/57.44±31.21, 1.7±0.88/58.56±26.04 mg/dl, respectively). The incidence of delayed graft function in each group was 29.9%, 44.9%, and 28.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Kidney transplantation from donors with AKI, although associated with a higher rate of delayed graft function, results in good long-term transplant survival and reliable kidney functionality after 5 years. The inclusion of donors with AKI may widely extend the pool of available organs; however, careful donor selection is necessary.",

We investigated the effect of donor AKI on renal function and chronic changes on protocol biopsies at 1-year post-transplant. Donor AKI was defined according to Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Between 2013 and 2017, 333 kidneys were transplanted and subsequently biopsied after 1 year. Fifty-three kidneys from AKI donors (AKIN stage I n = 42, stage II n = 8, stage III n = 3) were compared to 280 kidneys from non-AKI donors. At 1-year follow-up, patient and graft survival were comparable. Donor AKI was not predictive of IFTA (Banff interstitial fibrosis plus tubular atrophy scores) at 1-year post-transplant biopsy (2.10 ± 1.28 in AKI, 2.09 ± 1.22 in non-AKI, P = .95). Donor AKI was also not associated with progression of IFTA from 3 to 12 months (P = .69), or inferior glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, P = .94). In a multivariate analysis, the odds of IFTA >2 were comparable between AKI and non-AKI groups. In conclusion, the transplantation of kidneys from donors with predominantly stage I AKI results in comparable function and degree of fibrosis on protocol biopsies 1-year post-transplant. Selected grafts from donors with AKI are a valuable tool for expanding the donor pool for kidney transplantation.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate how kidney transplantation (KT) from a donor with AKI affects long-term graft survival in various situations. All patients who underwent KT from DBD donors between June 2003 and April 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. The KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) criteria were used to classify donor AKI. The cohort included 376 donors (no AKI group, n = 117 [31.1%]; AKI group n = 259 [68.9%]). Death-censored graft survival was similar according to the presence of AKI, AKI severity, and the AKI trend (p = 0.929, p = 0.077, and p = 0.658, respectively). Patients whose donors had AKI who received using low dose (1.5 mg/kg for three days) rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (r-ATG) as the induction agent had significantly superior death-censored graft survival compared with patients in that group who received basiliximab (p = 0.039).

Although previous studies comparing clinical outcomes between AKI and non-AKI donors in KTs have shown comparable results, data on high-volume analysis of KTs outcomes with AKI donors are limited. This study aimed to analyze the selection trends of AKI donors and investigate the impact of AKI on graft failure using the United states cohort data. We analyzed a total 52,757 KTs collected in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipient (SRTR) from 2010 to 2015. The sample included 4,962 (9.4%) cases of KTs with AKI donors (creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dL). Clinical characteristics of AKI and non-AKI donors were analyzed and outcomes of both groups were compared. We also analyzed risk factors for graft failure in AKI donor KTs. Although the incidence of delayed graft function was higher in recipients of AKI donors compared to non-AKI donors, graft and patient survival were not significantly different between the two groups. We found donor hypertension, cold ischemic time, the proportion of African American donors, and high KDPI were risk factors for graft failure in AKI donor KTs. KTs from deceased donor with AKI showed comparable outcomes. Thus, donors with AKI need to be considered more actively to expand donor pool. Caution is still needed when donors have additional risk factors of graft failure.",

Kidneys from ≥65-year-old donors with comorbidities are more susceptible to cold ischemia time (CIT) and DGF and it is unknown whether such elderly kidneys with AKI can also be transplanted with satisfactory outcomes. All KTs from ≥65-year-old donors performed at our center from 1999 to 2019 (n = 233) were retrospectively analyzed and short- as well as long-term outcomes were compared for KTs from donors with (n = 64) and without AKI (n = 169). There were no significant differences regarding the frequency of DGF as well as the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 1 and 3 years post-transplant between the no-AKI and the AKI group (DGF: no-AKI 30.2% vs. AKI 40.6%, P = .17; eGFR at 1-year: 31.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 vs. 35.5 ml/min/1.73 m2 , P = .32; at 3-years: 33.8 ml/min/1.73 m2 vs. 40.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 , P = .18; respectively).

The current study analyzed the clinical significance of this new stage in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Subjects and Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 4045 eligible PTC patients. The patients were divided into four groups according to the extent of ETE: no ETE, ETE into perithyroidal tissue, T3b (ETE into the strap muscles), and ETE beyond the strap muscles. Differences in the clinical characteristics and prognosis of the four groups were assessed. Results: Of these 4045 patients, 2300 (56.9%) had no ETE, 1004 (24.8%) had ETE into perithyroidal tissue, 371 (9.2%) had ETE into the strap muscles, and 370 (9.1%) had ETE beyond the strap muscles. Tumor size, multifocality, lymph node metastasis (LNM), distant metastasis (DM), recurrence, and recurrence-free survival (RFS) between patients with ETE into perithyroidal tissue and patients without ETE did not show differences, but significant differences were observed between patients with T3b and patients without ETE, and only patients with ETE beyond the strap muscles had significantly worse overall survival (OS) than the other three groups. However, T3b did not independently predict worse RFS in univariable and multivariable analyses. Conclusions: T3b, distinguished from minimal ETE, may be related to larger tumor size, higher prevalence of multifocality, LNM, DM, recurrence, and worse RFS than no ETE, but it may not affect OS and may not independently predict recurrence in PTC patients.",
        "# Title: Is There a Difference Between Minimal and Gross Extension into the Strap Muscles for the Risk of Recurrence in Papillary Thyroid Carcinomas?\n# Abstract: Background: The morbidity of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is primarily related to locoregional recurrences and distant metastases. The definition of minimal extrathyroidal extension (mETE) has been recently revised. The presence of mETE does not impact mortality and is generally not considered to be a predictor for the risk of recurrence. This study aimed at comparing the risk of recurrence and the response to therapy of PTC with mETE and gross extrathyroidal extension (ETE) into the strap muscles (gETE) with low- and intermediate-risk PTC without ETE (low risk w/o ETE and intermediate risk w/o ETE, respectively) to further characterize the impact of ETE on outcomes. Methods: A total of 596 PTCs were analyzed according to the degree of ETE as well as other predictors of recurrence. Four groups of patients were compared, low risk w/o ETE (n = 251), intermediate risk w/o ETE (n = 89), mETE (n = 191), and gETE (n = 65), to determine the risk of recurrence and the response to treatment. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate associations between groups and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: The risk of recurrence was 3% in low risk w/o ETE PTC, 14% in intermediate risk w/o ETE, 14% in mETE, and 25% in gETE. The recurrence risk was increased by the presence of ETE (odds ratio [OR] = 2.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-5.85, p = 0.005) and lymph node metastases (OR = 2.44 [95% CI 1.25-4.76], p = 0.009). Patients with low-risk carcinomas w/o ETE experienced longer DFS than those with mETE (hazard ratio = 0.08 [95% CI 0.02-0.28], p < 0.001), but no significant difference was observed between intermediate risk w/o ETE, mETE, and gETE. In terms of the response to therapy, patients with gETE had higher rates of biochemical and/or structural incomplete responses within the first year of treatment (OR = 2.68 [95% CI 1.31-5.45], p = 0.007) and at the final follow-up evaluation (OR = 4.35 [95% CI 1.99-9.51], p < 0.001) compared with those with mETE. An analysis of the subgroups of microcarcinomas without lymph node metastases revealed no significant difference in DFS or the response to therapy between the low risk w/o ETE and mETE PTC groups. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that both mETE and gETE are independent risk factors for the risk of recurrence in PTC. Although gETE has a more pronounced impact on the recurrence risk and is associated with a worse response to therapy, mETE may not be associated with a low risk of recurrence. This observation suggests that patients with PTC and mETE may, in part, have an intermediate risk of recurrence and need to be followed accordingly."

Loss of LKB1 promotes cancer progression and influences therapeutic responses in preclinical studies; however, specific targeted therapies for lung cancer with LKB1 inactivation are currently unavailable. Here, we have identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) signature that is associated with the loss of LKB1 function. We discovered that LINC00473 is consistently the most highly induced gene in LKB1-inactivated human primary NSCLC samples and derived cell lines. Elevated LINC00473 expression correlated with poor prognosis, and sustained LINC00473 expression was required for the growth and survival of LKB1-inactivated NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, LINC00473 was induced by LKB1 inactivation and subsequent cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)/CREB-regulated transcription coactivator (CRTC) activation. We determined that LINC00473 is a nuclear lncRNA and interacts with NONO, a component of the cAMP signaling pathway, thereby facilitating CRTC/CREB-mediated transcription. Collectively, our study demonstrates that LINC00473 expression potentially serves as a robust biomarker for tumor LKB1 functional status that can be integrated into clinical trials for patient selection and treatment evaluation, and implicates LINC00473 as a therapeutic target for LKB1-inactivated NSCLC.",

In the present study, we found that the LNC473 expression was markedly elevated in HCC tissues and correlated with bigger tumor size, higher BCLC stage, vascular invasion and poor prognosis. Gain- and loss-of-function assay showed that LNC473 enhanced HCC cell proliferation and invasion and induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Mechanistically, LNC473 associated with oncoprotein survivin and regulates its stability. Moreover, LNC473 could recruit deubiquitinase USP9X to inhibit the ubiquitination level of survivin and then increase survivin expression.

However, the clinical value and biological function of LINC00473 in gastric cancer (GC) was still unknown. In our results, LINC00473 expression was increased in GC tissue samples and GC cell lines compared with paired adjacent normal stomach tissue samples and normal gastric epithelial cell line, respectively. High-expression of LINC00473 was correlated with poor histological type, advanced clinical stage, more lymph node metastasis and present distant metastasis. The results of Kaplan-Meier analysis and TCGA database similarly suggested that GC patients with LINC00473 high-expression had poorer prognosis than GC patients with LINC00473 low-expression. Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that LINC00473 high-expression served as independent unfavorable prognostic factor for overall survival in GC patients. The study in vitro indicated that silencing of LINC00473 had no effect on GC cell viability, but inhibited GC cell migration and invasion through modulating MMP2 and MMP9 expression. In conclusion, LINC00473 is associated with the malignant status and prognosis in GC cases, and functions as an oncogenic lncRNA to regulate GC cell migration and invasion.",

In our study, we found that LINC00473 was highly expressed in BC tissues and cells, and the elevated expression was correlated with shorter overall survival in patients with BC. Furthermore, knockdown of LINC00473 significantly inhibited the capacity of proliferation, invasion and migration of BC cells. Animal experiment suggested that silencing LINC00473 could significantly inhibit the tumor growth. Following experiments revealed that LINC00473 may function as a competing endogenous RNA to regulate the expression of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1 (MAPK1) through competition for miR-198. Thus, increased expression of LINC00473 in breast cancer tissues is linked to poor prognosis. LINC00473 may function as an endogenous completive RNA by sponging miR-198 to regulate MAPK1 expression. Findings of our study contributed to the basis for further exploring the application of LINC00473 as a prognostic and diagnostic biomarker.",
        "# Title: Long non‑coding RNA LINC00473/miR‑195‑5p promotes glioma progression via YAP1‑TEAD1‑Hippo signaling.\n# Abstract: There is an urgent need to identify novel potential therapeutic targets for diagnosis and treatment of glioma, a common primary tumor in brain, due to its high‑level invasiveness. Long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00473 has been reported as potentially critical regulators in various types of cancer tumorigenesis. However, the effects of LINC00473 on glioma cells is unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the clinical significance, effects and mechanism of LINC00437 on glioma tumorigenesis. In the present study, LINC00473 was significantly increased in glioma tissues and in cell models, and predicted a poor prognosis in patients with glioma. Notably, LINC00473 knockdown not only suppressed cell proliferation, invasion and migration of glioma cells, but also blocked cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis. Subcutaneous xenotransplanted tumor model experiments revealed that reduced LINC00473 expression was able to suppress in vivo glioma growth. Mechanistically, LINC00473 functioned as a competing endogenous (ce)RNA to decrease microRNA (miR)‑195‑5p expression. Moreover, Yes‑associated protein 1 (YAP1) and TEA domain family member 1 (TEAD1) were identified as downstream targets of miR‑195‑5p, whose expression levels were inhibited by miR‑195‑5p. LINC00473 knockdown suppressed glioma progression through the decrease of miR‑195‑5p and subsequent increase of YAP1 and TEAD1 expression levels. These results indicated LINC00473 might act as a ceRNA to sponge miR‑195‑5p, thus promoting YAP1 and TEAD1 expressions, and shedding light on the underlying mechanisms of LINC00473‑induced glioma progression.",
        "# Title: LINC00473 contributes to the radioresistance of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by regulating microRNA‑497‑5p and cell division cycle 25A.\n# Abstract: Long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00473 plays a carcinogenic role in a variety of different tumor types. Nevertheless, the mechanisms through which LINC00473 regulates the radiosensitivity of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells remains elusive. In the present study, reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR was used to quantify the expression of LINC00473, microRNA (miRNA/miR)‑497‑5p and cell division cycle 25A (CDC25A) in ESCC tissues. The association between LINC00473 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with ESCC was also assessed. Furthermore, Cell Counting kit‑8 and colony formation assays were carried out to monitor the proliferation of ESCC cells exposed to X‑ray radiation. A dual‑luciferase reporter assay was also conducted to analyze the interaction between LINC00473 and miR‑497‑5p, as well as the interaction between CDC25A and miR‑497‑5p. The findings of the present study demonstrated that in ESCC tissues and cells, the expression levels of LINC00473 and CDC25A were significantly upregulated, while the expression of miR‑497‑5p was downregulated. The high expression level of LINC00473 was associated with a higher T stage, lymph node metastasis stage and a lower tumor differentiation grade in patients with ESCC. Following irradiation, transfection with miR‑497‑5p mimics reduced the promoting effect of LINC00473 overexpression on ESCC cell proliferation, and partially impeded the resistance of ESCC cells to X‑ray radiation induced by LINC00473 overexpression. Moreover, transfection with miR‑497‑5p inhibitors partially alleviated the inhibitory effects of LINC00473 knockdown on cellular proliferation, and partly reversed the sensitivity of cells to X‑ray irradiation induced by LINC00473 knockdown. Furthermore, it was confirmed that miR‑497‑5p was able to bind LINC00473 and the 3'‑untranslated region of CDC25A. On the whole, the findings of the present study demonstrate that LINC00473 reduces the radiosensitivity of ESCC cells by modulating the miR‑497‑5p/CDC25A axis.",

        "# Title: LNC473 Regulating APAF1 IRES-Dependent Translation via Competitive Sponging miR574 and miR15b: Implications in Colorectal Cancer.\n# Abstract: A growing number of studies have focused on the involvement of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in the internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated translation in tumorigenesis; however, the underlying mechanisms in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain elusive. In this study, we show that LINC00473 (LNC473) exerted its functions as a tumor suppressor in promoting apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF1) IRES activity through competitively sponging miR574-5p and miR15b-5p in CRC initiation and pathogenesis. Specifically, LNC473 and its downstream target APAF1 were significantly downregulated accompanied by upregulated miR574-5p and miR15b-5p in CRC cells and tissues, which had a significant prognostic impact on clinical outcomes in our CRC cohort (n = 157). Furthermore, ectopic LNC473 significantly sponged endogenous miR574-5p or miR15b-5p and thereby inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation capacity, and it accelerated cell apoptosis through activating the APAF1-CASP9-CASP3 pathway. Notably, LNC473 overexpression resulted in dramatic promotion of APAF1 IRES activity and translation, whereas rescue experiments confirmed the recovery by the existence of LNC473 and miR574/15b-5p. Mechanistically, LNC473 overexpression promoted IRES binding domain exposure and removed the constraints controlling from miR574-5p and miR15b-5p, and subsequently enhanced IRES-mediated APAF1 expression in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, our results uncover a novel LNC473-miR574/miR15b-APAF1 signaling axis, which provides new targets and crosstalk regulation mechanism for CRC prevention and treatment.",
        "# Title: Knockdown of LINC00473 promotes radiosensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer cells via sponging miR-513a-3p.\n# Abstract: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung cancer. Radioresistance is a significant obstacle in NSCLC radiotherapy. Long non-coding RNA LINC00473 has been found to impact the radiotherapy in several malignant tumours. This study aimed to investigate the underlying role and mechanism of LINC00473 in regulating radiosensitivity of NSCLC cells. The levels of LINC00473 and miR-513a-3p were measured by quantitative Real-Time PCR. The relationship of LINC00473 with overall survival was tested by the Kaplan-Meier method. The effects of LINC00473 on cell viability and cell survival were assessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony survival assay in NSCLC cells exposed to different doses of radiation. A luciferase reporter assay was used to investigate the correlation between LINC00473 and miR-513a-3p. The present study showed that the relative LINC00473 expression was upregulated and miR-513a-3p expression was downregulated in radioresistant NSCLC patients compared with radiosensitive patients. And upregulated LINC00473 expression was associated with poor prognosis of NSCLC patients after radiotherapy. Radiation led to an increase in LINC00473 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The knockdown of LINC00473 markedly promoted radiosensitivity in NSCLC cells under different doses of radiation. LINC00473 was a sponge of miR-513a-3p and negatively regulated the miR-513a-3p expression. In conclusion, the inhibition of miR-513a-3p markedly reversed the promoted effect of LINC00473 knockdown on cell radiosensitivity. LINC00473 inhibition enhances radiosensitivity of NSCLC by sponging miR-513a-3p, providing a promising therapeutic target to increase the sensitivity of radiotherapy in NSCLC patients.",
        "# Title: lncRNA LINC00473 promotes proliferation, migration, invasion and inhibition of apoptosis of non-small cell lung cancer cells by acting as a sponge of miR-497-5p.\n# Abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-associated death worldwide and exhibits a poor prognosis. The present study aimed to determine the effect of long non-coding (lnc)RNA-LINC00473 on the development of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells by regulating the expression of microRNA (miR)-497-5p. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was conducted to detect the level of LINC00473 and miR-497-5p. An MTT assay, flow cytometry and Transwell tests were performed to evaluate the proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells. Western blotting was performed to detect the expression of apoptosis- and migration-related proteins. RNA immunoprecipitation and a luciferase reporter assay were performed to verify the regulatory relationship between lncRNA-LINC00473 and miR-497-5p. LINC00473 expression was upregulated in lung cancer tissues and NSCLC cells (A549 and H1299) when compared with adjacent tissues or human bronchial epithelial cell lines and the 5-year survival rate was lower in patients with high LINC00473 expression compared with in patients with low LINC00473 expression. A negative correlation between LINC00473 and miR-497-5p was observed in lung cancer tissues. Proliferation, migration and invasion as well as the related protein levels were increased in A549 and H1299 transfected with pcDNA3.1-LINC00473, while the opposite results were obtained in A549 and H1299 transfected with small interfering (si)-LINC00473. Notably, it was demonstrated that LINC00473 could bind directly with miR-497-5p and inhibit its expression. miR-497-5p inhibitors reversed the effect of si-LINC00473. Furthermore, the present study demonstrated that LINC00473 promoted the malignant behaviour of NSCLC cells via regulating the ERK/p38 and MAPK signalling pathways and the expression of miR-497-5p.",
        "# Title: Long intergenic non-coding RNA 00473 promotes proliferation and migration of gastric cancer via the miR-16-5p/CCND2 axis and by regulating AQP3.\n# Abstract: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, but its molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Increasing evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) play a pivotal role in various cancers recently. Our present study focused on exploring the function of long intergenic non-coding RNA 00473 (LINC00473) in GC. In this study, we found that LINC00473 expression was aberrantly increased in tumor tissues compared with the paired para-cancerous tissues. The expression of high LINC00473 in GC was notably correlated with a higher risk of lymphatic metastasis, a higher incidence of vascular cancer embolus, and advanced TNM stage. Further experiments showed that the overexpression of LINC00473 could promote the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells both in vitro and in vivo. The apoptosis of GC cells increased significantly by the decrease of LINC00473. Mechanistically, LINC00473 could sponge miR-16-5p in the cytoplasm and relieve its suppression of CCND2. Moreover, AQP3 was found to be a significant downstream target gene for LINC00473 through RNA transcriptome sequencing, as demonstrated by qRT-PCR and western blot. Overexpression of LINC00473 can partially reverse the effects of AQP3 decrease on GC proliferation and metastasis. LINC00473 regulated AQP3 expression through CREB was confirmed by western blot. Our research indicates that LINC00473/miR-16-5p/CCND2 axis plays a role in the proliferation of GC and modulates AQP3 to influence GC cell metastasis, making it a potential therapeutic target for GC."

Positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]FDDNP and the determination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of these proteins constitute a means to visualize in vivo Aβ and tau brain accumulation. Information about longitudinal changes of these CSF and PET biomarkers in PD with regard to progression to dementia is lacking. We assessed the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of CSF and PET biomarkers of tau and Aβ with PD-related cognitive dysfunction in 6 healthy-controls (HC), 16 patients with PD without dementia (PDND), and 8 PD with dementia (PDD). All subjects underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing, [18F]FDDNP PET, and CSF Aβ-tau determination. After 18 months, the PDND group was re-assessed clinically and by neuropsychological, PET, and CSF determinations. Cross-sectionally, PDD had higher [18F]FDDNP binding in lateral temporal regions and lower levels of CSF Aβ levels compared to PDND, with a congruent correlation between the [18F]FDDNP binding and CSF Aβ levels. Longitudinally, higher baseline lateral temporal [18F]FDDNP binding was associated to longitudinal worsening in cognitive performances and progression to dementia among subjects classified as PDND at baseline, who additionally disclosed at follow-up an increase in lateral-temporal FDDNP binding, as well as a reduction in CSF Aβ and an increase in CSF tau levels. These results confirm the relevance of these CSF and PET biomarkers to PDD, being specifically the first to show [18F]FDDNP PET as a dementia risk biomarker in PD, along with longitudinal CSF and PET changes over time.",
        "# Title: Positron emission tomography imaging of tau pathology in progressive supranuclear palsy.\n# Abstract: Progressive supranuclear palsy is a rare form of atypical Parkinsonism that differs neuropathologically from other parkinsonian disorders. While many parkinsonian disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia, and multiple system atrophy are classified as synucleinopathies, progressive supranuclear palsy is coined a tauopathy due to the aggregation of pathological tau in the brain. [18F]AV-1451 (also known as [18F]-T807) is a positron emission tomography radiotracer that binds to paired helical filaments of tau in Alzheimer's disease. We investigated whether [18F]AV-1451 could be used as biomarker for the diagnosis and disease progression monitoring in progressive supranuclear palsy. Six progressive supranuclear palsy, six Parkinson's disease, and 10 age-matched healthy controls were recruited. An anatomical MRI and a 90-min PET scan, using [18F]AV-1451, were acquired from all participants. The standardized uptake value ratio from 60 to 90 min post-injection was calculated in each region of interest, using the cerebellar cortex as a reference region. No significant differences in standardized uptake value ratios were detected in our progressive supranuclear palsy group compared to the two control groups. [18F]AV-1451 may bind selectivity to the paired helical filaments in Alzheimer's disease, which differ from the straight conformation of tau filaments in progressive supranuclear palsy.",

[18F]AV-1451 is a positron emission tomography radiotracer designed to bind pathological tau. A post-mortem study using [18F]AV-1451 discovered off-target binding properties to neuromelanin in the substantia nigra. A subsequent clinical study reported a 30% decrease in [18F]AV-1451 binding in the midbrain of PD patients. A total of 12 patients and 10 healthy age-matched controls were recruited. An anatomical MRI and a 90-min PET scan, using [18F]AV-1451, were acquired from all participants. The standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) from 60 to 90 min post-injection was calculated for the substantia nigra, using the cerebellar cortex as the reference region. The substantia nigra was delineated using automated region of interest software. An independent samples ANOVA and LSD post hoc testing were used to test for differences in [18F]AV-1451 SUVR between groups. Substantia nigra SUVR from 60 to 90 min was significantly greater in HC compared to both PSP and PD groups. Although the PD group had the lowest SUVR, there was no significant difference in substantia nigra uptake between PD and PSP. [18F]AV-1451 may be the first PET radiotracer capable of imaging neurodegeneration of the substantia nigra in parkinsonisms.

We therefore wanted to study the retention patterns of 18F-AV-1451 in PD, PD-dementia (PDD), and DLB. To do this 44 healthy controls, 11 non-demented patients with PD, 18 patients with PDD, and six patients with DLB underwent MRI and 18F-AV-1451 PET scanning and cognitive testing. We found that parietal 18F-AV-1451 retention was increased in patients with DLB compared to controls and PD patients, while 18F-AV-1451 uptake was reduced in the substantia nigra in PDD. Increased parietal 18F-AV-1451 PET uptake was associated with impaired performance on verbal fluency tests, and the decreased uptake in the substantia nigra correlated with worse motor function. We found no effect of the monoamine oxidase B inhibitor rasagiline on 18F-AV-1451 binding. In conclusion DLB patients have increased parietal 18F-AV-1451 uptake. Increased parietal tau is associated with executive impairment in patients with synucleinopathies, while decreased uptake in the substantia nigra is associated with parkinsonism. Further, our data indicate that 18F-AV-1451 does not significantly bind to MAO-B in vivo.",

        "# Title: PET Imaging of Astrogliosis and Tau Facilitates Diagnosis of Parkinsonian Syndromes.\n# Abstract: Neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes comprise a number of disorders that are characterized by similar clinical features but are separated on the basis of different pathologies, i.e., aggregates of α-synuclein or tau protein. Due to the overlap of signs and symptoms a precise differentiation is often difficult, especially early in the disease course. Enormous efforts have been taken to develop tau-selective PET imaging agents, but strong off-target binding to monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) has been observed across first generation ligands. Nonetheless, astrogliosis-related MAO-B elevation is a common histopathological known feature of all parkinsonian syndromes and might be itself an interesting imaging target. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the performance of [18F]-THK5351, a combined MAO-B and tau tracer for differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes. [18F]-THK5351 PET was performed in 34 patients: six with Parkinson's disease (PD), nine with multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P), six with MSA with predominant cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C), and 13 with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) Richardson's syndrome. Volume-of-interest-based quantification of standardized-uptake-values was conducted in different parkinsonian syndrome-related target regions. PET results were subjected to multinomial logistic regression to create a prediction model discriminating among groups. Furthermore, we correlated tracer uptake with clinical findings. Elevated [18F]-THK5351 uptake in midbrain and diencephalon differentiated PSP patients from PD and MSA-C. MSA-C patients were distinguishable by high tracer uptake in the pons and cerebellar deep white matter when compared to PSP and PD patients, whereas MSA-P patients tended to show higher tracer uptake in the lentiform nucleus. A multinomial logistic regression classified 33/34 patients into the correct clinical diagnosis group. Tracer uptake in the pons, cerebellar deep white matter, and striatum was closely associated with the presence of cerebellar and parkinsonian symptoms of MSA patients. The current study demonstrates that combined MAO-B and tau binding of THK5351 facilitates differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes. Furthermore, our data indicate a correlation of MSA phenotype with [18F]-THK5351 uptake in certain brain regions, illustrating their relevance for the emergence of clinical symptoms and underlining the potential of THK5351 PET as a biomarker that correlates with pathological changes as well as with disease stage.",

We aimed to investigate its performance in combination with plasma tau levels in patients with non-AD tauopathy. Methods: A total of 47 participants were enrolled, including 10 healthy controls, 16 with tauopathy parkinsonism syndromes (9 with corticobasal syndrome [CBS], 7 with progressive supranuclear palsy [PSP]), 9 with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 4 with AD, and 8 with Parkinson's disease (PD). All participants underwent clinical assessments, 18F-T807 tau PET, brain MRI, and plasma tau assay. Results: The global cortical standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) of 18F-T807 PET was comparable between PD and control (p = 0.088). The cortical SUVR was significantly higher in AD group (p = 0.002) but was modestly increased in PSP group compared to the PD group (p = 0.044), especially in parietal and pallidal regions. Asymmetric 18F-T807 uptake at the pallidum was noted in patients with CBS and FTD. Cortical tau tracer uptake was associated with increased plasma total tau level (p = 0.016), especially in frontal and parietal regions. Regional tracer uptake was correlated with cortical thinning in patients with CBS and PSP (CBS: r = -0.092, p = 0.025; PSP: r = -0.114, p = 0.015). Conclusions: The 18F-T807 tau tracer uptake was only modestly increased in patients with PSP. Although the cortical tau tracer uptake correlated with regional cortical atrophy and plasma tau levels, a four-repeated tau-specific tracer is needed for future classifying tauopathy parkinsonism syndromes.",

Our previous study identified an NF-KappaB interacting lncRNA (NKILA) which was negatively correlated with breast cancer metastasis and patient prognosis. However, its clinical significance and potential role in Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) remain unclear. Here we show that NKILA is down-regulated in TSCC cancer tissues than that in matched adjacent noncancerous tissues. And low NKILA expression in TSCC is significantly correlated with tumor metastasis and poor patient prognosis. In vitro, overexpression of NKILA decreases TSCC cells migration and invasion. Mechanistic study shows that NKILA inhibits the phosphorylation of IκBα and NF-κB activation as well as the induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Ectopic expression of NKILA in Tscca cells inhibits NF-κB activator TNF-α-promoted cell migration and invasion, while applying NF-κB inhibitor Bay-117082 or JSH-23 in NKILA silenced CAL27 cells reverses cell migration capacity to lower level. In vivo experimental metastasis model also demonstrates NKILA inhibits lung metastasis of NOD/SCID mice with TSCC tumors. These results suggested that NKILA is a vital determinant of TSCC migration and invasion and NF-κB signaling pathway mediates this effect. Given the above mentioned function of NKILA, it could act as a potential predictor for overall survival in patients with TSCC and a potential therapeutic target for TSCC intervention.",

The previous studies found that NKILA interacted with and suppressed the nuclear translocation of NF-KappaB, which influenced metastasis and prognosis in breast cancer. However the clinical significance and biological role of NKILA in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unknown.",
        "# Title: NKILA inhibits NF-κB signaling and suppresses tumor metastasis.\n# Abstract: The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) NKILA (nuclear transcription factor NF-κB interacting lncRNA) functions as a suppressor in human breast cancer and tongue cancer. However, the clinical significance and biological roles of NKILA in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remain unknown. In this study, we showed that NKILA was downregulated in ESCC tissues and cancer cells compared with their normal counterparts. Low NKILA expression correlated with large tumor size and advanced TNM stage, and predicted poor overall and disease-free survival of ESCC patients. Further loss- and gain-of-function assays indicated that NKILA inhibited proliferation and migration of ESCC cells in vitro, suppressed tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, NKILA could inhibit phosphorylation of IκBα, suppress p65 nuclear translocation and downregulate the expression of NF-κB target genes in ESCC cells. These results suggest NKILA could suppress malignant development of ESCC via abrogation of the NF-κB signaling and may potentially serve as a prognostic marker for ESCC.",
        "# Title: Long noncoding RNA NKILA enhances the anti-cancer effects of baicalein in hepatocellular carcinoma via the regulation of NF-κB signaling.\n# Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancer and leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Baicalein, a principle flavonoid, has shown attractive anti-cancer effects on HCC. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and influencing factors contributing to the anti-cancer effects of baicalein on HCC are still largely unknown. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been revealed to be fascinating therapeutic targets for cancers. The roles of NF-κB Interacting LncRNA (NKILA) are recently explored in several cancers. However, the expressions, clinical significances, roles and action mechanisms of NKILA in the anti-cancer effects of baicalein on HCC are unknown. In this study, we found that NKILA is down-regulated in HCC and reduced expression of NKILA indicts poor survival of HCC patients. Functional assays showed that overexpression of NKILA enhances the roles of baicalein on HCC cell proliferation inhibition, apoptosis induction, and migration inhibition in vitro and tumor growth suppression in vivo. Conversely, knockdown of NKILA suppresses the effects of baicalein. Mechanistically, we found that NKILA inhibits IκBα phosphorylation, NF-κB nuclear translocation, and NF-κB activity. NKILA also enhances the inhibitory effects of baicalein on NF-κB signaling. Furthermore, the effects of NKILA on baicalein-induced NF-κB activity inhibition, cell growth inhibition, apoptosis induction, and migration inhibition are reversed by NF-κB nuclear translocation inhibitor JSH-23. Collectively, our data demonstrated that NKILA enhances the anti-cancer effects of baicalein on HCC in vitro and in vivo via the regulation of NF-κB signaling, and implied that the combination of NKILA and baicalein would be potential therapeutic strategies for HCC.",
        "# Title: lncRNA-NKILA/NF-κB feedback loop modulates laryngeal cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and radioresistance.\n# Abstract: Laryngeal cancer is one of the most common head and neck malignant tumors and is commonly resistant to X-ray-based radiotherapy. NF-κB interacting lncRNA (NKILA) has been reported to serve as a tumor suppressor in several cancers through combining with NF-κB: IκB complex thereby inhibiting NF-κB activation. Herein, we demonstrated a low NKILA expression in laryngeal cancer and its correlation with shorter overall survival in patients with laryngeal cancer. NKILA serves as a tumor suppressor in laryngeal cancer by suppressing laryngeal cancer cell viability and migration, whereas promoting cell apoptosis; NKILA knockdown reverses the cytotoxicity of X-ray radiation on laryngeal cancer cells through combining with NF-κB: IκB complex to inhibit IκB phosphorylation, inhibit p65 nuclear translocation, and finally inhibit NF-κB activation. NF-κB binds to the promoter region of NKILA to activate its transcriptional activity, upregulated NKILA then inhibits IκB phosphorylation and NF-κB activation, thus forming a negative feedback loop to sensitize laryngeal cancer cell to X-ray radiation. In conclusion, NKILA can serve as a promising agent of enhancing the cytotoxicity of X-ray radiation on laryngeal cancer and addressing the radioresistance of laryngeal cancer.",
        "# Title: LncRNA NKILA correlates with the malignant status and serves as a tumor-suppressive role in rectal cancer.\n# Abstract: NF-κB interacting lncRNA (NKILA) has been found to function as a tumor-suppressive role in various human cancers. However, the role of NKILA in rectal cancer is still unknown. The objective of this study is to investigate the clinical value and biological function of NKILA in rectal cancer. The association between NKILA expression and clinical variables including prognosis was estimated in rectal cancer patients. The gain-of-function study of NKILA in rectal cancer cell was conducted to evaluate the effect of NKILA on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and NF-κB signaling pathway. The results suggested NKILA expression was decreased in rectal cancer tissues and cells, and correlated with clinical stage, T classification, N classification and M classification. NKILA low-expression was an independent poor prognostic factor in rectal cancer patients. NKILA-inhibited rectal cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via suppressing NF-κB signaling. In conclusion, NKILA serves as an antioncogenic lncRNA in rectal cancer.",

        "# Title: Long non-coding RNA NKILA serves as a biomarker in the early diagnosis and prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer.\n# Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. The prognosis of patients with CRC at an advanced stage is poor. Biomarkers currently used in clinical practice, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen (CA) 19-9, lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity for early diagnosis and prediction, therefore there remains a requirement to improve the prognosis of patients with CRC. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been revealed to serve fundamental roles in various pathophysiological processes, including cancer initiation and progression. The present study investigated the expression and clinical significance of the lncRNA nuclear factor-κB interacting long non-coding RNA (NKILA) in CRC. It was identified that NKILA was downregulated in six CRC cell lines and tissues (n=173). Low NKILA expression was significantly associated with a poor differentiation grade, larger tumor size and advanced Tumor-Node-Metastases stages. Further statistical analyses revealed that low NKILA expression predicted poor overall survival (OS) rate and progression-free survival (PFS) rate. In addition, low NKILA expression was determined as an independent risk factor for poor OS and PFS. Furthermore, NKILA exhibited a relatively high sensitivity and specificity compared with CEA and CA19-9 in the early diagnosis of CRC. The serum level of NKILA was positively correlated with the level in tissues. In addition, a decreased NKILA level in serum was revealed to be partially restored post-operatively. In conclusion, low NKILA expression has been demonstrated to accelerate CRC progression and NKILA may be a potential novel biomarker in early diagnosis and prognosis of patients with CRC.",
        "# Title: NKILA, a prognostic indicator, inhibits tumor metastasis by suppressing NF-κB/Slug mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition in hepatocellular carcinoma.\n# Abstract: The metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the major obstacles hindering its therapeutic efficacy, leading to low surgical resection rate, high mortality and poor prognosis. Accumulating evidence has shown that both long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and NF-κB play vital roles in the regulation of cancer metastasis. However, the clinical significance and biological function of NKILA (NF-κB interacting lncRNA) and its interaction with NF-κB in HCC remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that NKILA was down-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines, and decreased NKILA expression was significantly associated with larger tumor size and positive vascular invasion in HCC patients. NKILA reduction was an independent risk factor of HCC patients' poor prognosis, and the 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of patients with low and high NKILA expression were 15.6% and 60.0%, respectively. Moreover, NKILA inhibits migration and invasion of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, NKILA prevents Slug/epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway via suppressing phosphorylation of IκBα, p65 nuclear translocation and NF-κB activation. In conclusion, these results indicate that NKILA might serve as an effective prognostic biomarker and a promising therapeutic target against HCC metastasis."

Herein, we evaluated plasma chemokines in patients with active tuberculosis (ATB) and after completing treatment (TTB) and compared them to BCG-vaccinated healthy controls (HC). Levels of chemokines were measured by cytometric bead array. Levels of CXCL8, CXCL9 and CXCL10 were higher in ATB patients compared to HC, but they decreased in TTB. Levels of CCL2 and CCL5 in ATB patients were similar to those observed in HC. Thus, the high levels of CXC-chemokines detected during ATB, which can modulate the trafficking of immune cells from the periphery to the site of infection, were reversed by anti-mycobacterial treatment.",
        "# Title: Beyond the IFN-γ horizon: biomarkers for immunodiagnosis of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\n# Abstract: Latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (LTBI) is defined by the presence of M. tuberculosis-specific immunity in the absence of active tuberculosis. LTBI is detected using interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) or the tuberculin-skin-test (TST). In clinical practice, IGRAs and the TSTs have failed to distinguish between active tuberculosis and LTBI and their predictive value to identify individuals at risk for the future development of tuberculosis is limited. There is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that improve the clinical performance of current immunodiagnostic methods for tuberculosis prevention, diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Here, we review the landscape of potential alternative biomarkers useful for detection of infection with M. tuberculosis. We describe what individual markers add in terms of specificity for active/latent infection, prediction of progression to active tuberculosis and immunodiagnostic potential in high-risk groups' such as HIV-infected individuals and children.",
        "# Title: Diagnostic performance of a cytokine and IFN-γ-induced chemokine mRNA assay after Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigen stimulation in whole blood from infected individuals.\n# Abstract: Interferon (IFN)-γ release assays have limited sensitivity and cannot differentiate between active tuberculosis (TB) disease and latent TB infection (LTBI). Numerous cytokines and regulator factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis and control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Additional cytokines and chemokines associated with M. tuberculosis infection may improve the performance of IFN-γ release assays. We developed a real-time RT-PCR TaqMan assay for targeting levels of eight human targets [IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-10, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11] and evaluated the assay with three different study groups. Results showed that the sensitivity of TNF-α, IL-2R, and CXCL10 in the active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) group was 96.43%, 96.43%, and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity of IL-2R and CXCL10 in the latent tuberculosis infection group was 86.36% and 81.82%, respectively. Statistical results showed that TNF-α and CXCL9 were the best individual markers for differentiating between the PTB, LTBI, and non-TB groups. For optimal sensitivity and differentiation of M. tuberculosis infection status, the simultaneous detection of multiple targets was attempted. The combination of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2R, and the combination of TNF-α, IL-2R, CXCL9, and CXCL10 showed the best performance for detecting active PTB (both 100% positivity) and LTBI (86.36% and 81.82% positivity, respectively). These results imply that the combination of suitable markers is useful in efficiently diagnosing TB and differentiating M. tuberculosis infection status.",

We evaluated the potentials of 74 host markers as biomarkers for the immunological diagnosis of tuberculosis and monitoring of treatment response. Fifty-five individuals that presented with signs and symptoms requiring investigation for tuberculosis disease were prospectively recruited prior to clinical diagnosis, at a health centre in Cape Town, South Africa. Patients were later classified as having tuberculosis disease or other respiratory diseases (ORD) using a combination of clinical, radiological and laboratory findings. Out of 74 host markers that were evaluated in plasma samples from study participants using a multiplex platform, 18 showed potential as tuberculosis diagnostic candidates with the most promising being NCAM, CRP, SAP, IP-10, ferritin, TPA, I-309, and MIG, which diagnosed tuberculosis disease individually, with area under the ROC curve ≥0.80. Six-marker biosignatures containing NCAM diagnosed tuberculosis disease with a sensitivity of 100% (95%CI, 86.3-100%) and specificity of 89.3% (95%CI, 67.6-97.3%) irrespective of HIV status, and 100% accuracy in the absence of HIV infection. Furthermore, the concentrations of 11 of these proteins changed with treatment, thereby indicating that they may be useful in monitoring of the response to tuberculosis treatment. Our findings have potential to be translated into a point-of-care screening test for tuberculosis, after future validation studies.",

Seventy-nine individuals, 27 active TB, 32 latent infection subsets, 20 individuals derivative purified protein (PPD) negative (subjects that do not have any indurative cutaneous reaction after 72 hrs of intradermal injection of PPD) and with other pulmonary disease were retrospectively studied. Forty-eight analytes were evaluated by Luminex Assay in plasma obtained from whole blood stimulated cells. The diagnostic accuracies of the markers detected were evaluated by ROC curve analysis and by the combination of multiple biomarkers to improve the potential to discriminate between infection/disease and non infection. Among 48 cytokines, 13 analytes, namely IL-3, IL-12-p40, LIF, IFNα2, IL-2ra, IL-13, b-NGF, SCF, TNF-β, TRAIL, IL-2, IFN-γ, IP-10, and MIG, were significantly higher in the active TB and LTBI groups, compared to NON-TB patients, while MIF was significantly lower in active TB patients compared to NON-TB and LTBI groups. The diagnostic accuracies of the markers detected in the culture supernatants evaluated by ROC curve analysis revealed that 11 analytes (IL2, IP10, IFN-γ, IL13, MIG, SCF, b-NGF, IL12-p40, TRAIL, IL2 Ra, LIF) discriminated between NON-TB and LTBI groups, with AUC for all analytes ≥0.73, while 14 analytes (IL2, IP10, IFN-γ, MIG, SCF, b-NGF, IL12-p40, TRAIL, IL2Ra, MIF, TNF-β, IL3, IFN-α2, LIF) discriminated between NON-TB and active TB groups, with AUC ≥0.78, that is a moderate, value in terms of accuracy of a diagnostic test. Finally, the combinations of seven biomarkers resulted in the accurate prediction of 88.89% of active TB patients, 82.35% of subjects with latent infection and 90% of non-TB patients, respectively. Taken together, our data suggest that combinations of whole blood Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) antigen dependent cytokines production could be useful as biomarkers to determine tuberculosis disease states when compared to non TB cohort.",

In addition, Barthel Index, HAD score and pain scores were also recorded. Twenty-five percent of patients developed shoulder pain within 2 weeks of their stroke. There was a statistically significant association with ipsilateral sensory impairment (p < 0.005), abnormal rheumatological examination (p < 0.001) and depression score (p < 0.005).

The outcomes may be affected from variations in patterns of lymph node metastasis. As the patterns of lymph node sub-classifications, multiple station metastases of mediastinal lymph nodes (MN2), highest metastasis of the mediastinal lymph nodes (HM), distribution of metastatic nodes (skip N2 or non-skip N2), and clinical (c-) N factor have been cited. We investigated these factors for patients with pathological stage IIIA (pIIIA) N2 NSCLC. We reviewed 121 consecutive patients with pIIIA N2 who underwent complete resection.

Twenty children on dialysis intended to perform a 12-week graded community-based exercise program. Exercise capacity and fatigue level were studied; muscle force and health-related quality of life were secondary outcomes. All outcomes were measured at baseline (T = 0) and after intervention (T = 1). Fourteen of the 20 patients (70%) either did not start the program or did not complete the program. Of these patients, seven did not complete or even start the exercise program because of a combination of lack of time and motivational problems. Six patients were not able to continue the program or were unable to do the follow-up measurements because of medical problems.

Our data show that twice-weekly exercise of a moderate intensity during HD can lead to exercise capacity improvement in 3 months. We identified barriers to and strategies for the successful implementation of intradialytic exercise. We suggest that intradialytic exercise intervention may be effective to improve exercise capacity in children receiving maintenance HD.",

Aerobic, strengthening exercises, and exergames are reported as effective in the treatment of symptoms associated with CKD. Unlike adult patients, there are insufficient studies investigating the effects of exercise on disease-related symptoms in pediatric CKD. This study aimed to compare the effects of Nintendo Wii-based exergaming and home-based fun video exercises on functional capacity, muscle strength, physical activity (PA), depression, fatigue, and QoL in pediatric patients with CKD. Twenty-three pediatric patients with CKD were included in the study and randomized to group I (Nintendo Wii Fit) and group II (home-based fun video exercises). Patients in both groups underwent exercise programs twice per week for 6 weeks. Functional capacity, muscle strength, PA, QoL, fatigue, and depression of the patients were evaluated before and after the treatments. Sixteen patients completed the study. After treatment, significant differences were observed in both groups on 6MWT, muscle strength, average daily steps, PedsQoL Child Self-Report PHSS, and the Visual Fatigue Scale. Left knee flexor muscle strength and average step counts were found to be superior in group I. Both exergaming and home-based fun video exercises provide positive effects on functional capacity, muscle strength, fatigue, PA, depression, and QoL in pediatric patients with CKD. We think that these exercise methods can help to protect physical and mental health of patients and should be included in treatment from the early stages of the disease."

LTBI is detected using interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) or the tuberculin-skin-test (TST). In clinical practice, IGRAs and the TSTs have failed to distinguish between active tuberculosis and LTBI and their predictive value to identify individuals at risk for the future development of tuberculosis is limited. There is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that improve the clinical performance of current immunodiagnostic methods for tuberculosis prevention, diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Here, we review the landscape of potential alternative biomarkers useful for detection of infection with M. tuberculosis.

Numerous cytokines and regulator factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis and control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Additional cytokines and chemokines associated with M. tuberculosis infection may improve the performance of IFN-γ release assays. We developed a real-time RT-PCR TaqMan assay for targeting levels of eight human targets [IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-10, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11] and evaluated the assay with three different study groups. Results showed that the sensitivity of TNF-α, IL-2R, and CXCL10 in the active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) group was 96.43%, 96.43%, and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity of IL-2R and CXCL10 in the latent tuberculosis infection group was 86.36% and 81.82%, respectively. Statistical results showed that TNF-α and CXCL9 were the best individual markers for differentiating between the PTB, LTBI, and non-TB groups. For optimal sensitivity and differentiation of M. tuberculosis infection status, the simultaneous detection of multiple targets was attempted. The combination of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2R, and the combination of TNF-α, IL-2R, CXCL9, and CXCL10 showed the best performance for detecting active PTB (both 100% positivity) and LTBI (86.36% and 81.82% positivity, respectively). These results imply that the combination of suitable markers is useful in efficiently diagnosing TB and differentiating M. tuberculosis infection status.",

Fifty-five individuals that presented with signs and symptoms requiring investigation for tuberculosis disease were prospectively recruited prior to clinical diagnosis, at a health centre in Cape Town, South Africa. Patients were later classified as having tuberculosis disease or other respiratory diseases (ORD) using a combination of clinical, radiological and laboratory findings. Out of 74 host markers that were evaluated in plasma samples from study participants using a multiplex platform, 18 showed potential as tuberculosis diagnostic candidates with the most promising being NCAM, CRP, SAP, IP-10, ferritin, TPA, I-309, and MIG, which diagnosed tuberculosis disease individually, with area under the ROC curve ≥0.80. Six-marker biosignatures containing NCAM diagnosed tuberculosis disease with a sensitivity of 100% (95%CI, 86.3-100%) and specificity of 89.3% (95%CI, 67.6-97.3%) irrespective of HIV status, and 100% accuracy in the absence of HIV infection.

Seventy-nine individuals, 27 active TB, 32 latent infection subsets, 20 individuals derivative purified protein (PPD) negative (subjects that do not have any indurative cutaneous reaction after 72 hrs of intradermal injection of PPD) and with other pulmonary disease were retrospectively studied. Forty-eight analytes were evaluated by Luminex Assay in plasma obtained from whole blood stimulated cells. The diagnostic accuracies of the markers detected were evaluated by ROC curve analysis and by the combination of multiple biomarkers to improve the potential to discriminate between infection/disease and non infection. Among 48 cytokines, 13 analytes, namely IL-3, IL-12-p40, LIF, IFNα2, IL-2ra, IL-13, b-NGF, SCF, TNF-β, TRAIL, IL-2, IFN-γ, IP-10, and MIG, were significantly higher in the active TB and LTBI groups, compared to NON-TB patients, while MIF was significantly lower in active TB patients compared to NON-TB and LTBI groups. The diagnostic accuracies of the markers detected in the culture supernatants evaluated by ROC curve analysis revealed that 11 analytes (IL2, IP10, IFN-γ, IL13, MIG, SCF, b-NGF, IL12-p40, TRAIL, IL2 Ra, LIF) discriminated between NON-TB and LTBI groups, with AUC for all analytes ≥0.73, while 14 analytes (IL2, IP10, IFN-γ, MIG, SCF, b-NGF, IL12-p40, TRAIL, IL2Ra, MIF, TNF-β, IL3, IFN-α2, LIF) discriminated between NON-TB and active TB groups, with AUC ≥0.78, that is a moderate, value in terms of accuracy of a diagnostic test.

This single-center study was conducted to assess the accuracy of SWE in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), in comparison with transient elastography (TE), by using liver biopsy (LB) as the reference standard. Consecutive patients with CHC scheduled for LB by referring physicians were studied. One hundred and twenty-one patients met inclusion criteria. On the same day, real-time SWE using the ultrasound (US) system, Aixplorer (SuperSonic Imagine S.A., Aix-en-Provence, France), TE using FibroScan (Echosens, Paris, France), and US-assisted LB were consecutively performed.

The intra-operator reliability was better for same-day evaluations (ICC = 0.91) than the inter-operator reliability (ICC = 0.78). Intra-observer agreement decreased when scans were repeated on a different day. Inter-session repeatability was between 3.3% and 9.9% for intra-day repeated scans, compared with to 6.5%-12% for inter-day repeated scans.

        "# Title: Performance of 2-D shear wave elastography in liver fibrosis assessment compared with serologic tests and transient elastography in clinical routine.\n# Abstract: Liver stiffness values assessed with 2-D shear wave elastography (SWE), transient elastography (TE) and simple serologic tests were compared with respect to non-invasive assessment in a cohort of 127 consecutive patients with chronic liver diseases. The rate of reliable liver stiffness measurements was significantly higher with 2-D SWE than with TE: 99.2% versus 74.8%, p < 0.0001 (different reliability criteria used, according to current recommendations). In univariate analysis, liver stiffness measured with 2-D SWE correlated best with fibrosis stage estimated with TE (r = 0.699, p < 0.0001), followed by Forns score (r = 0.534, p < 0.0001) and King's score (r = 0.512, p < 0.0001). However, in multivariate analysis, only 2-D SWE-measured values remained correlated with fibrosis stage (p < 0.0001). The optimal 2-D SWE cutoff values for predicting significant fibrosis were 8.03 kPa for fibrosis stage ≥2 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.832) and 13.1 kPa for fibrosis stage 4 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.915), respectively. In conclusion, 2-D SWE can be used to obtain reliable liver stiffness measurements in almost all patients and performs very well in predicting the presence of liver cirrhosis.",
        "# Title: Assessment of liver fibrosis with 2-D shear wave elastography in comparison to transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse imaging in patients with chronic liver disease.\n# Abstract: Two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2-D SWE) is an ultrasound-based elastography method integrated into a conventional ultrasound machine. It can evaluate larger regions of interest and, therefore, might be better at determining the overall fibrosis distribution. The aim of this prospective study was to compare 2-D SWE with the two best evaluated liver elastography methods, transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse (point SWE using acoustic radiation force impulse) imaging, in the same population group. The study included 132 patients with chronic hepatopathies, in which liver stiffness was evaluated using transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging and 2-D SWE. The reference methods were liver biopsy for the assessment of liver fibrosis (n = 101) and magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography for the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis (n = 31). No significant difference in diagnostic accuracy, assessed as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), was found between the three elastography methods (2-D SWE, transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging) for the diagnosis of significant and advanced fibrosis and liver cirrhosis in the \"per protocol\" (AUROCs for fibrosis stages ≥2: 0.90, 0.95 and 0.91; for fibrosis stage [F] ≥3: 0.93, 0.95 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.92, 0.96 and 0.92) and \"intention to diagnose\" cohort (AUROCs for F ≥2: 0.87, 0.92 and 0.91; for F ≥3: 0.91, 0.93 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.88, 0.90 and 0.89). Therefore, 2-D SWE, ARFI imaging and transient elastography seem to be comparably good methods for non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis.",

The goal of this study was to assess the clinical use of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) evaluated by supersonic shear imaging (SSI), FibroScan, and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) in a cohort of NAFLD patients who underwent liver biopsy. A total of 291 NAFLD patients were prospectively enrolled from November 2011 to February 2015 at 2 French university hospitals. LSM was assessed by SSI, FibroScan (M probe), and ARFI within two weeks prior to liver biopsy. Calculations of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) were performed and compared for the staging of liver fibrosis. AUROC for SSI, FibroScan, and ARFI were 0.86, 0.82, and 0.77 for diagnoses of ≥F2; 0.89, 0.86, and 0.84 for ≥F3; and 0.88, 0.87, and 0.84 for F4, respectively. SSI had a higher accuracy than ARFI for diagnoses of significant fibrosis (≥F2) (P = 0.004). Clinical factors related to obesity such as body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2) , waist circumference ≥102 cm or increased parietal wall thickness were associated with LSM failures when using SSI or FibroScan and with unreliable results when using ARFI. In univariate analysis, FibroScan values were slightly correlated with NAFLD activity score and steatosis (R = 0.28 and 0.22, respectively), whereas SSI and ARFI were not; however, these components of NAFLD did not affect LSM results in multivariate analysis. The cutoff values for SSI and FibroScan for staging fibrosis with a sensitivity ≥90% were very close: 6.3/6.2 kPa for ≥F2, 8.3/8.2 kPa for ≥F3, and 10.5/9.5 kPa for F4.",

Patients with CHB infection who underwent liver biopsy were consecutively included. After exclusions, 257 patients were analyzed. Two-dimensional SWE resulted in a significantly higher rate of reliable measurements (98.1%, 252/257) than TE (93.0%, 239/257) (p = 0.011). Liver stiffness measurements of the two examinations exhibited a strong correlation (r = 0.835, p < 0.001).

The purpose of this study was to perform an intra-individual comparison between 2-D shear wave elastography (2-D-SWE with a GE system) and Virtual Touch Tissue Quantification (VTTQ with a Siemens system) to assess whether these can be used interchangeably to grade fibrosis. Ninety-three patients (51 men, 42 women; mean age, 54 y) with liver disease of various etiologies (hepatitis B virus = 47, hepatitis C virus = 22; alcohol = 6, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis = 5, other = 13) were included. Using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values, liver fibrosis was classified into clinically non-significant (F0/F1) and significant (≥F2) fibrosis. Results indicated that intra-modality repeatability was excellent for both techniques (GE 2-D-SWE: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.89 [0.84-0.93]; VTTQ: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.90 [0.86-0.93]). Intra-modality classification agreement for fibrosis grading was good to excellent (GE 2-D-SWE: κ = 0.65, VTTQ: κ = 0.82). However, inter-modality agreement for fibrosis grading was only fair (κ = 0.31) using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values of fibrosis. In conclusion, although both GE 2-D-SWE and Siemens VTTQ exhibit good to excellent intra-modality repeatability, inter-modality agreement is only fair, suggesting that these should not be used interchangeably.",

Discard rates for SCDs were ascertained. The relative risk of graft loss was similar for recipients of SCD kidneys with sCr of 1.6-2.0 and >2.0 mg/dL, compared to </=1.5 mg/dL. For ECD recipients, the relative risk of graft failure significantly increased with increasing sCr. Of potential SCDs, the adjusted risk of discard was higher with sCr >2.0 mg/dL (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 7.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.5-7.6) and 1.6-2.0 mg/dL (AOR 2.7; CI 2.5-2.9) relative to sCr </=1.5 mg/dL.

We performed a multicenter study to determine associations of AKI (increasing admission-to-terminal serum creatinine by AKI Network stages) with kidney discard, delayed graft function (DGF) and 6-month estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). In 1632 donors, kidney discard risk increased for AKI stages 1, 2 and 3 (compared to no AKI) with adjusted relative risks of 1.28 (1.08-1.52), 1.82 (1.45-2.30) and 2.74 (2.0-3.75), respectively. Adjusted relative risk for DGF also increased by donor AKI stage: 1.27 (1.09-1.49), 1.70 (1.37-2.12) and 2.25 (1.74-2.91), respectively. Six-month eGFR, however, was similar across AKI categories but was lower for recipients with DGF (48 [interquartile range: 31-61] vs. 58 [45-75] ml/min/1.73m(2) for no DGF, p < 0.001). There was significant favorable interaction between donor AKI and DGF such that 6-month eGFR was progressively better for DGF kidneys with increasing donor AKI (46 [29-60], 49 [32-64], 52 [36-59] and 58 [39-71] ml/min/1.73m(2) for no AKI, stage 1, 2 and 3, respectively; interaction p = 0.05).

Protocol biopsies were done at 1, 4, and 12 months posttransplant. One and four month formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies from 48 patients (24 AKI donors, 24 non-AKI) underwent global gene expression profiling using DNA microarrays (96 arrays). DGF was more common in the AKI group but eGFR, graft survival at 1 year and proportion with IF/TA>2 at 1 year were similar for the two groups. At 1 month, there were 898 differentially expressed genes in the AKI group (p-value <0.005; FDR <10%), but by 4 months there were no differences.

To determine whether this policy is justified, we analyzed outcomes of donor kidneys with acute kidney injury (AKI) in a large UK cohort. A retrospective analysis of the UK Transplant Registry evaluated deceased donors between 2003 and 2013. Donors were classified as no AKI, or AKI stage 1-3 according to Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Relationship of AKI with delayed graft function/primary nonfunction (DGF/PNF), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and graft-survival at 90 days and 1 year was analyzed. There were 11 219 kidneys (1869 [17%] with AKI) included. Graft failure at 1 year is greater for donors with AKI than for those without (graft survival 89% vs. 91%, p = 0.02; odds ratio (OR) 1.20 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.41]). DGF rates increase with donor AKI stage (p < 0.005), and PNF rates are significantly higher for AKIN stage 3 kidneys (9% vs. 4%, p = 0.04) Analysis of association between AKI and recipient eGFR suggests a risk of inferior eGFR with AKI versus no AKI (p < 0.005; OR 1.25 [95% CI: 1.08-1.31]). We report a small reduction in 1-year graft-survival of kidneys from donors with AKI. We conclude that AKI stage 1 or 2 kidneys should be used; however, caution is advised for AKI stage 3 donors.",

We aimed to evaluate the impact of donors' AKI severity and trend on graft outcomes in DDK transplantation. This was a retrospective study of DDK transplantation performed from 2005 to 2014. Based on maximum and terminal serum creatinine values before transplantation, the AKI trends were categorized as improving or worsening. Of 413 DDKs, 275 developed AKI: 177 stage 1, 52 stage 2, and 46 stage 3. DDKs with AKI had 212 improving AKI and 63 worsening AKI. Graft outcomes were similar based on AKI stage. Worsening AKI did not affect delayed graft function development; however, it significantly elevated graft failure risk even after adjusting for AKI stage and Kidney Donor Risk Index. Graft survival of the improving group was similar to DDKs with no AKI. This study showed that AKI severity of DDKs did not affect overall graft outcomes. Notably, DDKs with improving AKI showed a similar graft survival rate to DDKs without AKI, although worsening AKI had a worse prognosis. Consideration of the AKI trend, rather than its severity, is needed when DDKs with AKI are allocated.",

We performed a multicenter study to determine associations between donor AKI (from none to severe based on AKI Network stages) and all-cause graft failure, adjusting for donor, transplant, and recipient factors. We examined whether any of the following factors modified the relationship between donor AKI and graft survival: kidney donor profile index, cold ischemia time, donation after cardiac death, expanded-criteria donation, kidney machine perfusion, donor-recipient gender combinations, or delayed graft function. We also evaluated the association between donor AKI and a 3-year composite outcome of all-cause graft failure or estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 in a subcohort of 30% of recipients.

We found no evidence that pre-specified variables modified the effect of donor AKI on graft survival. In the subcohort, donor AKI was not associated with the 3-year composite outcome. Donor AKI was not associated with graft failure in this well-phenotyped cohort. Given the organ shortage, the transplant community should consider measures to increase utilization of kidneys from deceased donors with AKI.",
        "# Title: Success of kidney transplantations from deceased donors with acute kidney injury.\n# Abstract: BACKGROUND The acceptance of organs from deceased donors with acute kidney injury (AKI) varies considerably, with uncertain outcomes. The current organ shortage has led to increased use of marginal donor organs. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective, single-center study included 642 patients who underwent kidney allograft transplantation between 2005 and 2016. The recipients were categorized into 3 groups: AKI-1 (n=214), comprising donors with a peak serum creatinine (SCr) level of 1.1-2.0 mg/dl; AKI-2 (n=89), comprising donors with a peak SCr level >2 mg/dl; and non-AKI (n=339), comprising donors with normal kidney function (SCr <1.1 mg/dl). RESULTS The cumulative survival rates for patients and grafts did not significantly differ among the AKI-1, AKI-2, and non-AKI groups at the 1-year (91.6%/79.4%, 92.1%/83.1%, 95.3%/88.5%, respectively) and 5-year assessments (79.4%/67.8%, 86.8%/71.7%, 80.5%/71.1%, respectively). These findings were corroborated by mean SCr values and estimated glomerular filtration rates at the 1-year (2.08±1.7/51.16±23.45, 2.01±1.52/56.46±23.63, 1.81±1.13/55.44±23.26 mg/dl, respectively) and 5-year assessments (1.91±1.28/51.06±24.65, 1.74±0.66/57.44±31.21, 1.7±0.88/58.56±26.04 mg/dl, respectively). The incidence of delayed graft function in each group was 29.9%, 44.9%, and 28.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Kidney transplantation from donors with AKI, although associated with a higher rate of delayed graft function, results in good long-term transplant survival and reliable kidney functionality after 5 years. The inclusion of donors with AKI may widely extend the pool of available organs; however, careful donor selection is necessary.",

We investigated the effect of donor AKI on renal function and chronic changes on protocol biopsies at 1-year post-transplant. Donor AKI was defined according to Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Between 2013 and 2017, 333 kidneys were transplanted and subsequently biopsied after 1 year. Fifty-three kidneys from AKI donors (AKIN stage I n = 42, stage II n = 8, stage III n = 3) were compared to 280 kidneys from non-AKI donors. At 1-year follow-up, patient and graft survival were comparable. Donor AKI was not predictive of IFTA (Banff interstitial fibrosis plus tubular atrophy scores) at 1-year post-transplant biopsy (2.10 ± 1.28 in AKI, 2.09 ± 1.22 in non-AKI, P = .95). Donor AKI was also not associated with progression of IFTA from 3 to 12 months (P = .69), or inferior glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, P = .94). In a multivariate analysis, the odds of IFTA >2 were comparable between AKI and non-AKI groups. In conclusion, the transplantation of kidneys from donors with predominantly stage I AKI results in comparable function and degree of fibrosis on protocol biopsies 1-year post-transplant. Selected grafts from donors with AKI are a valuable tool for expanding the donor pool for kidney transplantation.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate how kidney transplantation (KT) from a donor with AKI affects long-term graft survival in various situations. All patients who underwent KT from DBD donors between June 2003 and April 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. The KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) criteria were used to classify donor AKI. The cohort included 376 donors (no AKI group, n = 117 [31.1%]; AKI group n = 259 [68.9%]). Death-censored graft survival was similar according to the presence of AKI, AKI severity, and the AKI trend (p = 0.929, p = 0.077, and p = 0.658, respectively). Patients whose donors had AKI who received using low dose (1.5 mg/kg for three days) rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (r-ATG) as the induction agent had significantly superior death-censored graft survival compared with patients in that group who received basiliximab (p = 0.039).

        "# Title: Outcomes and factors leading to graft failure in kidney transplants from deceased donors with acute kidney injury-A retrospective cohort study.\n# Abstract: Due to shortage of donor, kidney transplants (KTs) from donors with acute kidney injury (AKI) are expanding. Although previous studies comparing clinical outcomes between AKI and non-AKI donors in KTs have shown comparable results, data on high-volume analysis of KTs outcomes with AKI donors are limited. This study aimed to analyze the selection trends of AKI donors and investigate the impact of AKI on graft failure using the United states cohort data. We analyzed a total 52,757 KTs collected in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipient (SRTR) from 2010 to 2015. The sample included 4,962 (9.4%) cases of KTs with AKI donors (creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dL). Clinical characteristics of AKI and non-AKI donors were analyzed and outcomes of both groups were compared. We also analyzed risk factors for graft failure in AKI donor KTs. Although the incidence of delayed graft function was higher in recipients of AKI donors compared to non-AKI donors, graft and patient survival were not significantly different between the two groups. We found donor hypertension, cold ischemic time, the proportion of African American donors, and high KDPI were risk factors for graft failure in AKI donor KTs. KTs from deceased donor with AKI showed comparable outcomes. Thus, donors with AKI need to be considered more actively to expand donor pool. Caution is still needed when donors have additional risk factors of graft failure.",

Kidneys from ≥65-year-old donors with comorbidities are more susceptible to cold ischemia time (CIT) and DGF and it is unknown whether such elderly kidneys with AKI can also be transplanted with satisfactory outcomes. All KTs from ≥65-year-old donors performed at our center from 1999 to 2019 (n = 233) were retrospectively analyzed and short- as well as long-term outcomes were compared for KTs from donors with (n = 64) and without AKI (n = 169). There were no significant differences regarding the frequency of DGF as well as the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 1 and 3 years post-transplant between the no-AKI and the AKI group (DGF: no-AKI 30.2% vs. AKI 40.6%, P = .17; eGFR at 1-year: 31.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 vs. 35.5 ml/min/1.73 m2 , P = .32; at 3-years: 33.8 ml/min/1.73 m2 vs. 40.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 , P = .18; respectively). Death-censored graft survival and patient survival were also not significantly different.

Four hundred twenty-nine patients had migraine, of which 16.5% reported that headaches could be precipitated by cheese or chocolate, and nearly always both. Of the migraine patients, 18.4% reported sensitivity to all alcoholic drinks, while another 11.8% were sensitive to red wine but not to white wine; 28% of the migrainous patients reported that beer would precipitate headaches. There was a definite statistical association between sensitivity to cheese/chocolate and to red wine (P < 0.001) and also to beer (P < 0.001), but none between diet sensitivity and sensitivity to alcoholic drinks in general. None of 40 patients with tension headache (diagnosed by International Headache Society criteria) reported sensitivity to foods, and only one was sensitive to alcoholic drinks. The prevalence of sensitivity among 46 patients with some migrainous features was intermediate between the migraine and tension headache categories. It is concluded that cheese/chocolate and red wine sensitivity, in particular, have closely related mechanisms, in some way related more to migraine than to more chronic tension-type headache, while quite separate mechanisms play a major role in sensitivity to alcoholic drinks in general.",

A total of 51,383 subjects completed a headache questionnaire and constituted the 'Head-HUNT' Study. Questionnaire-based information on smoking was available in 95% and on alcohol in 89% of the individuals. Associations were assessed in multivariate analyses, estimating prevalence odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Prevalence rates for headache were higher amongst smokers compared with never smokers, most evident for those under 40 years smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.6). Passive smoking was also associated with higher headache prevalence. For alcohol use, there was a tendency of decreasing prevalence of migraine with increasing amounts of alcohol consumption compared with alcohol abstinence. Only with regard to symptoms indicating alcohol overuse, a positive association with frequent headache was found. The association between headache and smoking found in the present study raises questions about a causal relationship, e.g. that smoking causes headache or that it allays stress induced by headache. The observed negative association between migraine and alcohol consumption is probably explained by the headache precipitating properties of alcohol.",

Our previous study identified an NF-KappaB interacting lncRNA (NKILA) which was negatively correlated with breast cancer metastasis and patient prognosis. However, its clinical significance and potential role in Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) remain unclear. Here we show that NKILA is down-regulated in TSCC cancer tissues than that in matched adjacent noncancerous tissues. And low NKILA expression in TSCC is significantly correlated with tumor metastasis and poor patient prognosis. In vitro, overexpression of NKILA decreases TSCC cells migration and invasion. Mechanistic study shows that NKILA inhibits the phosphorylation of IκBα and NF-κB activation as well as the induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Ectopic expression of NKILA in Tscca cells inhibits NF-κB activator TNF-α-promoted cell migration and invasion, while applying NF-κB inhibitor Bay-117082 or JSH-23 in NKILA silenced CAL27 cells reverses cell migration capacity to lower level. In vivo experimental metastasis model also demonstrates NKILA inhibits lung metastasis of NOD/SCID mice with TSCC tumors. These results suggested that NKILA is a vital determinant of TSCC migration and invasion and NF-κB signaling pathway mediates this effect. Given the above mentioned function of NKILA, it could act as a potential predictor for overall survival in patients with TSCC and a potential therapeutic target for TSCC intervention.",

In this study, we showed that NKILA was downregulated in ESCC tissues and cancer cells compared with their normal counterparts. Low NKILA expression correlated with large tumor size and advanced TNM stage, and predicted poor overall and disease-free survival of ESCC patients. Further loss- and gain-of-function assays indicated that NKILA inhibited proliferation and migration of ESCC cells in vitro, suppressed tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, NKILA could inhibit phosphorylation of IκBα, suppress p65 nuclear translocation and downregulate the expression of NF-κB target genes in ESCC cells. These results suggest NKILA could suppress malignant development of ESCC via abrogation of the NF-κB signaling and may potentially serve as a prognostic marker for ESCC.",

Baicalein, a principle flavonoid, has shown attractive anti-cancer effects on HCC. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and influencing factors contributing to the anti-cancer effects of baicalein on HCC are still largely unknown. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been revealed to be fascinating therapeutic targets for cancers. The roles of NF-κB Interacting LncRNA (NKILA) are recently explored in several cancers. However, the expressions, clinical significances, roles and action mechanisms of NKILA in the anti-cancer effects of baicalein on HCC are unknown. In this study, we found that NKILA is down-regulated in HCC and reduced expression of NKILA indicts poor survival of HCC patients. Functional assays showed that overexpression of NKILA enhances the roles of baicalein on HCC cell proliferation inhibition, apoptosis induction, and migration inhibition in vitro and tumor growth suppression in vivo. Conversely, knockdown of NKILA suppresses the effects of baicalein. Mechanistically, we found that NKILA inhibits IκBα phosphorylation, NF-κB nuclear translocation, and NF-κB activity. NKILA also enhances the inhibitory effects of baicalein on NF-κB signaling. Furthermore, the effects of NKILA on baicalein-induced NF-κB activity inhibition, cell growth inhibition, apoptosis induction, and migration inhibition are reversed by NF-κB nuclear translocation inhibitor JSH-23. Collectively, our data demonstrated that NKILA enhances the anti-cancer effects of baicalein on HCC in vitro and in vivo via the regulation of NF-κB signaling, and implied that the combination of NKILA and baicalein would be potential therapeutic strategies for HCC.",

NF-κB interacting lncRNA (NKILA) has been reported to serve as a tumor suppressor in several cancers through combining with NF-κB: IκB complex thereby inhibiting NF-κB activation. Herein, we demonstrated a low NKILA expression in laryngeal cancer and its correlation with shorter overall survival in patients with laryngeal cancer. NKILA serves as a tumor suppressor in laryngeal cancer by suppressing laryngeal cancer cell viability and migration, whereas promoting cell apoptosis; NKILA knockdown reverses the cytotoxicity of X-ray radiation on laryngeal cancer cells through combining with NF-κB: IκB complex to inhibit IκB phosphorylation, inhibit p65 nuclear translocation, and finally inhibit NF-κB activation. NF-κB binds to the promoter region of NKILA to activate its transcriptional activity, upregulated NKILA then inhibits IκB phosphorylation and NF-κB activation, thus forming a negative feedback loop to sensitize laryngeal cancer cell to X-ray radiation. In conclusion, NKILA can serve as a promising agent of enhancing the cytotoxicity of X-ray radiation on laryngeal cancer and addressing the radioresistance of laryngeal cancer.",

The prognosis of patients with CRC at an advanced stage is poor. Biomarkers currently used in clinical practice, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen (CA) 19-9, lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity for early diagnosis and prediction, therefore there remains a requirement to improve the prognosis of patients with CRC. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been revealed to serve fundamental roles in various pathophysiological processes, including cancer initiation and progression. The present study investigated the expression and clinical significance of the lncRNA nuclear factor-κB interacting long non-coding RNA (NKILA) in CRC. It was identified that NKILA was downregulated in six CRC cell lines and tissues (n=173). Low NKILA expression was significantly associated with a poor differentiation grade, larger tumor size and advanced Tumor-Node-Metastases stages. Further statistical analyses revealed that low NKILA expression predicted poor overall survival (OS) rate and progression-free survival (PFS) rate. In addition, low NKILA expression was determined as an independent risk factor for poor OS and PFS. Furthermore, NKILA exhibited a relatively high sensitivity and specificity compared with CEA and CA19-9 in the early diagnosis of CRC. The serum level of NKILA was positively correlated with the level in tissues. In addition, a decreased NKILA level in serum was revealed to be partially restored post-operatively. In conclusion, low NKILA expression has been demonstrated to accelerate CRC progression and NKILA may be a potential novel biomarker in early diagnosis and prognosis of patients with CRC.",

Accumulating evidence has shown that both long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and NF-κB play vital roles in the regulation of cancer metastasis. However, the clinical significance and biological function of NKILA (NF-κB interacting lncRNA) and its interaction with NF-κB in HCC remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that NKILA was down-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines, and decreased NKILA expression was significantly associated with larger tumor size and positive vascular invasion in HCC patients. NKILA reduction was an independent risk factor of HCC patients' poor prognosis, and the 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of patients with low and high NKILA expression were 15.6% and 60.0%, respectively. Moreover, NKILA inhibits migration and invasion of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, NKILA prevents Slug/epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway via suppressing phosphorylation of IκBα, p65 nuclear translocation and NF-κB activation. In conclusion, these results indicate that NKILA might serve as an effective prognostic biomarker and a promising therapeutic target against HCC metastasis."

      "referenceConclusion": "LEAP for ACL reconstructions seems to be effective and safe. This procedure restores rotational stability, leading to good clinical results, optimal functional outcomes, and great patient satisfaction. Most patients returned to their pre-injury level of sport at a mean of 6 months. LET ACL reconstruction may be associated with greater clinical outcomes, but, on the other hand, it could be associated with a higher reoperation rate compared to ALL reconstruction.",

        "# Title: Prospective and randomized evaluation of ACL reconstruction with three techniques: a clinical and radiographic evaluation at 5 years follow-up.\n# Abstract: A variety of graft sources have been used for ACL reconstruction to improve functions and kinematics in ACL deficient knees. The two most commonly used autogenous grafts are the central third of the patellar tendon and the hamstring tendon constructs. The choice of different grafts and different construct influence the final clinical outcome of ACL reconstruction. The 3 groups, of 25 patients each, were generated by choosing the technique (PT tendon, 4 strand hamstring, and single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty) to utilize and followed for 5 years, with an alternate systematic sampling. Our comparison has shown significant kneeling pain in the patellar tendon with respect to the groups with hamstrings techniques. Single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty achieved subjective score significantly higher with respect to the other two groups as well as for the time to resume sport. The study confirms that patellar tendon and hamstring can be equivalent options for ACL reconstruction. This study demonstrated that a superior outcome as far as subjective clinical findings were concerned, was obtained in group III. Patients in the latter group were also able to return to sports sooner than those in the bone-patellar tendon graft group and the four-strand hamstring group.",
        "# Title: ST/G ACL reconstruction: double strand plus extra-articular sling vs double bundle, randomized study at 3-year follow-up.\n# Abstract: Several investigators have reported the presence of biomechanical, kinematic, anatomic, fiber orientation patterns and biological differences between the anteromedial bundle and the posterolateral bundle of ACL. The purpose of this prospective randomized study was to compare the clinical, instrumental and X-ray outcome of two ACL reconstruction techniques with hamstring tendons: one with a single intra-articular bundle associated to an extra-articular sling, the second with a more anatomic double-bundle technique that reproduces better the native ACL function. From an initial group of 100 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction, 72 patients (35 single bundle plus lateral plasty and 37 double bundle) were evaluated with IKDC, Tegner score, KT2000 arthrometer, Activity Rating Scale, Psychovitality Questionnaire and Ahlback radiographic score at a mean 3 years follow-up. Double-bundle group showed significantly better results regarding IKDC, ROM, Activity Rating Scale and time to return to sport. Also KT 2000 showed significant differences in objective stability. The double-bundle technique for ACL reconstruction described in this paper has demonstrated significantly better subjective, objective and functional results compared with a double-stranded hamstrings plus extra-articular sling at a minimum 3-year follow-up.",

        "# Title: A medium to long-term follow-up of ACL reconstruction using double gracilis and semitendinosus grafts.\n# Abstract: This paper reports the results of our approach to ACL tears and knee laxity, based on 30 years of experience in ACL reconstruction with hamstrings and founded on the following cornerstones: the use of doubled semitendinosus and gracilis as a free graft; the use of an out-in technique for femoral drilling and of very strong and stiff fixation devices; the careful examination and repair or reconstruction of the lateral compartment in selected patients; and the use of unaggressive rehabilitation. We prospectively evaluated a series of 100 consecutive patients who underwent ACL reconstruction between 2001 and 2002. A clinical and radiological follow-up was performed at a minimum of 6 years. After 6 years, the International Knee Documentation Committee score demonstrated good-to-excellent results (A and B) in 98% of patients. However, arthrometric results using the KT-1000 demonstrated that 6/80 patients (7.5%) had >5 mm manual maximum side-to-side difference. The median Tegner activity score was 5 (range 1-9); the median Lysholm score was 96 (range 81-100); and the median subjective IKDC score was 94 (range 66-100). We reported 6/80 failures as revealed by a 2+ or 3+ pivot-shift test result and/or KT-1000 side-to-side difference of more than 5 mm. The IKDC score revealed excellent results in all women who underwent extra-articular tenodesis. Radiographic evaluation demonstrated early signs of osteoarthritis in 9% of patients.",

        "# Title: Addition of anterolateral ligament reconstruction to primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction could benefit recovery of functional outcomes.\n# Abstract: This study aimed to compare functional outcomes sequentially up to 1 year after combined anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR) and isolated ACLR. Fifty patients who underwent ACLR with versus without ALLR were analyzed at four different time points (preoperatively and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively). For the functional outcomes, muscle strength and acceleration time (AT) were measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. Proprioception was evaluated using joint position sense and dynamic postural stability. Patient-reported outcomes were measured using the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK-11) scores. Functional performance was assessed using single-leg hop distance (SLHD) and Limb Symmetry Index. In the operated knees, quadriceps (at 6 months postoperatively, p = 0.003) and hamstring (at 6 and 12 months postoperatively, p < 0.001) strength were significantly higher in the combined ACLR and ALLR group than the isolated ACLR group. The TSK-11 (at 6 and 12 months postoperatively, p < 0.001) was significantly lower in the combined ACLR and ALLR group than the isolated ACLR group. SLHD was significantly higher in the combined ACLR and ALLR group than the isolated ACLR group (at 6 months, p = 0.022 and at 12 months, p = 0.024). The addition of ALLR to primary ACLR yielded better muscle performance, fear of movement, and functional performance than isolated ACLR."

In addition, Barthel Index, HAD score and pain scores were also recorded. Twenty-five percent of patients developed shoulder pain within 2 weeks of their stroke. There was a statistically significant association with ipsilateral sensory impairment (p < 0.005), abnormal rheumatological examination (p < 0.001) and depression score (p < 0.005).

Four hundred twenty-nine patients had migraine, of which 16.5% reported that headaches could be precipitated by cheese or chocolate, and nearly always both. Of the migraine patients, 18.4% reported sensitivity to all alcoholic drinks, while another 11.8% were sensitive to red wine but not to white wine; 28% of the migrainous patients reported that beer would precipitate headaches. There was a definite statistical association between sensitivity to cheese/chocolate and to red wine (P < 0.001) and also to beer (P < 0.001), but none between diet sensitivity and sensitivity to alcoholic drinks in general. None of 40 patients with tension headache (diagnosed by International Headache Society criteria) reported sensitivity to foods, and only one was sensitive to alcoholic drinks. The prevalence of sensitivity among 46 patients with some migrainous features was intermediate between the migraine and tension headache categories. It is concluded that cheese/chocolate and red wine sensitivity, in particular, have closely related mechanisms, in some way related more to migraine than to more chronic tension-type headache, while quite separate mechanisms play a major role in sensitivity to alcoholic drinks in general.",

A total of 51,383 subjects completed a headache questionnaire and constituted the 'Head-HUNT' Study. Questionnaire-based information on smoking was available in 95% and on alcohol in 89% of the individuals. Associations were assessed in multivariate analyses, estimating prevalence odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Prevalence rates for headache were higher amongst smokers compared with never smokers, most evident for those under 40 years smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.6). Passive smoking was also associated with higher headache prevalence. For alcohol use, there was a tendency of decreasing prevalence of migraine with increasing amounts of alcohol consumption compared with alcohol abstinence. Only with regard to symptoms indicating alcohol overuse, a positive association with frequent headache was found. The association between headache and smoking found in the present study raises questions about a causal relationship, e.g. that smoking causes headache or that it allays stress induced by headache.

      "referenceConclusion": "The complete explanation of the genomic background behind melanoma pathogenesis remains elusive. This study presents a summary of current understanding regarding the clonal relatedness of mutated genes in primary cutaneous melanoma and matched tumors. We draw attention to the knowledge gap regarding the genetic heterogeneity of melanoma-specific genes, which could serve as a valuable tool in identifying suitable patients for trials testing possible new targeted therapies. Furthermore, we found that CM presents a significant concordance in BRAF status between primary and metastatic tumors than in previous meta-analyses, probably due to technical advances, although a minority of patients showed inconsistencies. Therefore, we propose that molecular testing in metastatic tissue is a more appropriate method for determining BRAF status to tailor the treatment decision, although it is still reasonable to use the primary tumor in cases of difficulty. Further research should investigate the factors causing these discrepancies and the feasibility of using other molecular markers with BRAF status to better stratify patients for melanoma treatment.",

        "# Title: Intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity of BRAF(V600E))mutations in primary and metastatic melanoma.\n# Abstract: The rationale for using small molecule inhibitors of oncogenic proteins as cancer therapies depends, at least in part, on the assumption that metastatic tumors are primarily clonal with respect to mutant oncogene. With the emergence of BRAF(V600E) as a therapeutic target, we investigated intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity in melanoma using detection of the BRAF(V600E) mutation as a marker of clonality. BRAF mutant-specific PCR (MS-PCR) and conventional sequencing were performed on 112 tumors from 73 patients, including patients with matched primary and metastatic specimens (n = 18). Nineteen patients had tissues available from multiple metastatic sites. Mutations were detected in 36/112 (32%) melanomas using conventional sequencing, and 85/112 (76%) using MS-PCR. The better sensitivity of the MS-PCR to detect the mutant BRAF(V600E) allele was not due to the presence of contaminating normal tissue, suggesting that the tumor was comprised of subclones of differing BRAF genotypes. To determine if tumor subclones were present in individual primary melanomas, we performed laser microdissection and mutation detection via sequencing and BRAF(V600E)-specific SNaPshot analysis in 9 cases. Six of these cases demonstrated differing proportions of BRAF(V600E)and BRAF(wild-type) cells in distinct microdissected regions within individual tumors. Additional analyses of multiple metastatic samples from individual patients using the highly sensitive MS-PCR without microdissection revealed that 5/19 (26%) patients had metastases that were discordant for the BRAF(V600E) mutation. In conclusion, we used highly sensitive BRAF mutation detection methods and observed substantial evidence for heterogeneity of the BRAF(V600E) mutation within individual melanoma tumor specimens, and among multiple specimens from individual patients. Given the varied clinical responses of patients to BRAF inhibitor therapy, these data suggest that additional studies to determine possible associations between clinical outcomes and intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity could prove fruitful.",

        "# Title: Discordancy in BRAF mutations among primary and metastatic melanoma lesions: clinical implications for targeted therapy.\n# Abstract: Systemic targeted molecular therapy, in the form of a selective BRAF inhibitor with or without a MEK inhibitor, is a standard treatment for patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma with unresectable stage III and IV disease. Patients with BRAF mutation-negative primary tumors may manifest BRAF mutation-positive metastatic disease. It is unclear whether all metastatic lesions carry the same BRAF mutation status found in the primary tumor and if discordancy exists, in what frequency it occurs. Primary and matched metastatic lesions in 25 melanoma patients were tested for the BRAF V600E/Ec, V600K, V600D, and V600R mutations using a BRAF RGQ PCR kit (Qiagen). Four patients (16%) had discrepancies between their primary and metastatic melanoma BRAF status. Of these patients, 2 (8%) had BRAF mutation-positive primary melanomas with BRAF mutation-negative metastatic lesions and 2 (8%) patient had BRAF mutation-negative melanoma with a BRAF mutation-positive metastatic lesion. In summary, discordancy of BRAF mutation status is not an infrequent finding between primary and metastatic melanoma. It may be prudent in previously negative patients to determine BRAF mutation status of new metastatic tumors for proper allocation of BRAF inhibitor therapy. Discordant BRAF status may have a role in the varying patterns of response and inevitable resistance seen with BRAF inhibitor therapies.",

Nevertheless, BRAF oncogene mutation status between different samples from the same patient has been studied with conflicting results. This study investigated the intrapatient homogeneity of BRAF mutation status using pyrosequencing in primary tumors and different metastatic sites of melanoma patients. Paired samples of lymphatic, visceral, and subcutaneous metastases and primary melanoma from 45 metastatic melanoma patients were tested for BRAF mutations using a pyrosequencing assay and by Sanger sequencing. Overall, sequencing for BRAF mutation status was performed in 114 paired samples from 45 patients. Eighteen patients (40%) carried a BRAF mutation, including BRAF V600E (12/18), BRAF V600K (5/18), and BRAF V600R (1/18) mutations. Multiple BRAF mutations (V600E and V600K) were found in one patient. Among the patients with BRAF mutations, a good agreement in BRAF mutation status was found between the first and second tumor samples genotyped (91%; Cohen's κ coefficient: 0.81). Discordance in BRAF mutation status was found only in four patients, involving all three patients in whom sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases were sampled. These SLNs exhibited a wild-type genotype and were discordant with the other BRAF-mutated samples found in the same patient. The intrapatient BRAF status was predominantly homogeneous. However, SLN genotyping using pyrosequencing might be inaccurate in determining the actual mutation status of melanoma. Further studies are required to confirm the lack of reliability of SLN.",

Treatment with BRAFV600 inhibitors has improved overall and disease-free survival in metastatic melanoma patients whose tumors harbor BRAFV600 mutations. Although the BRAFV600E mutation appears to have a critical role in tumor initiation, its expression during tumor progression remains controversial. In fact, various authors claim that BRAFV600E heterogeneity is evident in melanoma tumors. Herein, we investigated the pattern of BRAFV600E expression in matched primary and metastatic samples from 140 patients. Using a combination of real-time PCR and immunohistochemical analyses, we demonstrated that BRAFV600E expression is homogeneous in melanoma tumors and hypothesized that the heterogeneity described by others might be attributable to technical issues when molecular methods are used. We also demonstrated the high efficiency of the anti-BRAFV600E VE1 antibody for the detection of BRAFV600E mutations in melanoma tumors.",

BRAF mutation frequency ranges from 40 to 60% depending on melanoma clinical characteristics and detection technique used.Intertumoral heterogeneity could lead to misinterpretation of BRAF mutational status; this is especially important if testing is performed on primary specimens, when metastatic lesions are unavailable.Aim of this study was to identify the best combination of methods for detecting BRAF mutations (among peptide nucleic acid - PNA-clamping real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and capillary sequencing) and investigate BRAF mutation heterogeneity in a series of 100 primary melanomas and a subset of 25 matched metastatic samples.Overall, we obtained a BRAF mutation frequency of 62%, based on the combination of at least two techniques. Concordance between mutation status in primary and metastatic tumor was good but not complete (67%), when agreement of at least two techniques were considered. Next generation sequencing was used to quantify the threshold of detected mutant alleles in discordant samples. Combining different methods excludes that the observed heterogeneity is technique-based. We propose an algorithm for BRAF mutation testing based on agreement between immunohistochemistry and PNA; a third molecular method could be added in case of discordance of the results. Testing the primary tumor when the metastatic sample is unavailable is a good option if at least two methods of detection are used, however the presence of intertumoral heterogeneity or the occurrence of additional primaries should be carefully considered.",

        "# Title: The significance of BRAF V600E mutation status discordance between primary cutaneous melanoma and brain metastases: The implications for BRAF inhibitor therapy.\n# Abstract: To compare BRAF V600E status of primary melanoma and brain metastases to assess for discordance by cross-sectional study, and to evaluate clinical implications on BRAF inhibitor therapy.Brain metastases are common in patients with advanced melanoma. Between 40% and 60% of melanomas demonstrate BRAF mutations, BRAF V600E being most common. Selective BRAF inhibitor therapy has shown improvement in outcome in patients with melanoma. It has been demonstrated that not all metastatic lesions carry the same BRAF mutation status as the primary, but the frequency in which discordance occurs remains unclear. Establishing this may have implications in the use of BRAF inhibitors in patients with melanoma brain metastases.Patients who underwent metastectomy for melanoma brain metastases were identified using our local histopathology database. A review of histology of the primary lesion and the metastasis was performed for each patient, assessing for BRAF mutation status discordance.Fourty-two patients who underwent a brain metastectomy following excision of a melanoma primary were identified over a 7-year period. Median survival was 9 months. The median Breslow thickness for the primary lesion was 3.4 mm. Six patients (14%) had discrepancy between the BRAF status of a melanoma primary and metastatic lesion. Of these 6 patients, 3 had a BRAF mutation positive primary with a BRAF mutation negative metastatic lesion, while the other 3 had a BRAF mutation negative primary with BRAF mutation positive metastasis.There is an important discordance rate in the BRAF mutation status of melanoma primaries versus brain metastases.",
        "# Title: Concordance of somatic mutation profiles (BRAF,NRAS, and TERT) and tumoral PD-L1 in matched primary cutaneous and metastatic melanoma samples.\n# Abstract: Despite the efficacy of BRAF-targeted and PD-L1-related immune therapies in tackling metastatic melanoma, a significant number of patients exhibit resistance. Given this, the objective of the current study was to ascertain concordance of somatic mutations in BRAF/NRAS/TERT and immunohistochemical PD-L1 and CD8 in matched primary cutaneous and metastatic melanoma. A total of 43 archival paired samples with sufficient material for genetic and immunohistochemical analyses met the criteria for inclusion in the study. Immunohistochemistry was performed for PD-L1 and CD8 and direct-DNA Sanger sequencing for BRAF/NRAS/TERT promoter mutational analyses. Agreement between paired samples was assessed using Cohen κ. Poor concordance among primary and corresponding metastases was noted in BRAF (9/42 cases discordant, κ = 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.77; P = .0013), TERT promoter mutations (13/41 cases discordant, κ = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.04-0.62; P = .033), tumoral PD-L1 immunoexpression (9/43 cases discordant, κ = 0.39; 95% CI, 0.07-0.72; P = .0099), and immunoexpression of CD8+ T lymphocytes (12/43 cases discordant, κ = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.19-0.69; P = .002). Although NRAS1 and NRAS2 were highly concordant (42/43 and 39/43 cases, respectively), discordant NRAS2 mutational status was associated with a median time to metastasis of 90 versus 455 days for pairs with concordant status (P = .07). Although limited by sample size, our findings suggest that consideration be given to mutational analysis of metastatic tissue rather than the primary to guide BRAF-targeted therapy and question the roles of TERT promoter mutations and PD-L1 as predictive biomarkers in malignant melanoma.",

        "# Title: Immunohistochemical and Molecular Features of Melanomas Exhibiting Intratumor and Intertumor Histomorphologic Heterogeneity.\n# Abstract: Melanoma is a heterogeneous neoplasm at the histomorphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular levels. Melanoma with extreme histomorphologic heterogeneity can pose a diagnostic challenge in which the diagnosis may predominantly rely on its immunophenotypic profile. However, tumor survival and response to therapy are linked to tumor genetic heterogeneity rather than tumor morphology. Therefore, understating the molecular characteristics of such melanomas become indispensable. In this study, DNA was extracted from 11 morphologically distinct regions in eight formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded melanomas. In each region, mutations in 50 cancer-related genes were tested using next-generation sequencing (NGS). A tumor was considered genetically heterogeneous if at least one non-overlapping mutation was identified either between the histologically distinct regions of the same tumor (intratumor heterogeneity) or among the histologically distinct regions of the paired primary and metastatic tumors within the same patient (intertumor heterogeneity). Our results revealed that genetic heterogeneity existed in all tumors as non-overlapping mutations were detected in every tested tumor (n = 5, 100%; intratumor: n = 2, 40%; intertumor: n = 3, 60%). Conversely, overlapping mutations were also detected in all the tested regions (n = 11, 100%). Melanomas exhibiting histomorphologic heterogeneity are often associated with genetic heterogeneity, which might contribute to tumor survival and poor response to therapy.",

This study evaluated the intra-patient heterogeneity of BRAF, NRAS and c-KIT mutational status between 30 primary melanomas and 39 related metastases, using molecular analysis and immunohistochemistry. BRAF mutations were identified in 46.7% of primary melanomas and 48.7% of metastases and NRAS mutations in 20% and 25.6%, respectively. Intra-patient heterogeneity was detected in 13.3% of patients for both BRAF and NRAS genes and was not associated with clinico-pathological characteristics of melanomas or metastases. High consistency was observed between immunostaining and molecular methods for BRAFV600E (k = 0.90; p < 0.001) and NRASQ61R (k = 0.87; p < 0.001). These findings demonstrate a relevant intra-patient heterogeneity between primary and metastatic lesions that is independent of clinical variables and methodological approach.",
        "# Title: Intra- and Inter-Tumor BRAF Heterogeneity in Acral Melanoma: An Immunohistochemical Analysis.\n# Abstract: The current development of BRAF inhibitors has revolutionized the treatment of unresectable melanoma. As the potential heterogeneity of BRAF mutations in melanoma has been reported, accurate detection of BRAF mutations are important. However, the genetic heterogeneity of acral melanoma-a distinct type of melanoma with a unique genetic background-has not fully been investigated. We conducted a retrospective review of our acral melanoma patients. Of the 196 patients with acral melanoma, we retrieved 31 pairs of primary and matched metastatic melanomas. We immunostained the 31 pairs with VE1, a BRAFV600E-mutation-specific monoclonal antibody. Immunohistochemistry with VE1 showed a high degree of sensitivity and specificity for detecting BRAFV600E mutations compared with the real-time polymerase chain reaction method. A total of nine primary (29.0%) and eight metastatic (25.8%) acral melanomas were positive for VE1. In three patients (9.7%), we observed a discordance of VE1 staining between the primary and metastatic lesions. Of note, VE1 immunohistochemical staining revealed a remarkable degree of intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity in acral melanoma. Our study reveals that VE1 immunostaining is a useful ancillary method for detecting BRAFV600E mutations in acral melanoma and allows for a clear visualization of intra- and inter-tumor BRAF heterogeneity.",

In melanoma, the frequencies of intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity are controversial. We examined mutational heterogeneity within individual patients with melanoma using multiplatform analysis of commonly mutated driver and nonpassenger genes. We analyzed paired primary and metastatic tumors from 60 patients and multiple metastatic tumors from 39 patients whose primary tumors were unavailable (n = 271 tumors). We used a combination of multiplex SNaPshot assays, Sanger sequencing, mutation-specific PCR, or droplet digital PCR to determine the presence of BRAFV600, NRASQ61, TERT-124C>T, and TERT-146C>T mutations. Mutations were detected in BRAF (39%), NRAS (21%), and/or TERT (78%). Thirteen patients had TERTmutant discordant tumors; seven of these had a single tumor with both TERT-124C>T and TERT-146C>T mutations present at different allele frequencies. Two patients had both BRAF and NRAS mutations; one had different tumors and the other had a single tumor with both mutations. One patient with a BRAFmutant primary lacked mutant BRAF in at least one of their metastases. Overall, we identified mutational heterogeneity in 18 of 99 patients (18%). These results suggest that some primary melanomas may be composed of subclones with differing mutational profiles. Such heterogeneity may be relevant to treatment responses and survival outcomes."

Positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]FDDNP and the determination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of these proteins constitute a means to visualize in vivo Aβ and tau brain accumulation. Information about longitudinal changes of these CSF and PET biomarkers in PD with regard to progression to dementia is lacking. We assessed the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of CSF and PET biomarkers of tau and Aβ with PD-related cognitive dysfunction in 6 healthy-controls (HC), 16 patients with PD without dementia (PDND), and 8 PD with dementia (PDD). All subjects underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing, [18F]FDDNP PET, and CSF Aβ-tau determination. After 18 months, the PDND group was re-assessed clinically and by neuropsychological, PET, and CSF determinations. Cross-sectionally, PDD had higher [18F]FDDNP binding in lateral temporal regions and lower levels of CSF Aβ levels compared to PDND, with a congruent correlation between the [18F]FDDNP binding and CSF Aβ levels. Longitudinally, higher baseline lateral temporal [18F]FDDNP binding was associated to longitudinal worsening in cognitive performances and progression to dementia among subjects classified as PDND at baseline, who additionally disclosed at follow-up an increase in lateral-temporal FDDNP binding, as well as a reduction in CSF Aβ and an increase in CSF tau levels. These results confirm the relevance of these CSF and PET biomarkers to PDD, being specifically the first to show [18F]FDDNP PET as a dementia risk biomarker in PD, along with longitudinal CSF and PET changes over time.",

While many parkinsonian disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia, and multiple system atrophy are classified as synucleinopathies, progressive supranuclear palsy is coined a tauopathy due to the aggregation of pathological tau in the brain. [18F]AV-1451 (also known as [18F]-T807) is a positron emission tomography radiotracer that binds to paired helical filaments of tau in Alzheimer's disease. We investigated whether [18F]AV-1451 could be used as biomarker for the diagnosis and disease progression monitoring in progressive supranuclear palsy. Six progressive supranuclear palsy, six Parkinson's disease, and 10 age-matched healthy controls were recruited. An anatomical MRI and a 90-min PET scan, using [18F]AV-1451, were acquired from all participants. The standardized uptake value ratio from 60 to 90 min post-injection was calculated in each region of interest, using the cerebellar cortex as a reference region. No significant differences in standardized uptake value ratios were detected in our progressive supranuclear palsy group compared to the two control groups.

[18F]AV-1451 is a positron emission tomography radiotracer designed to bind pathological tau. A post-mortem study using [18F]AV-1451 discovered off-target binding properties to neuromelanin in the substantia nigra. A subsequent clinical study reported a 30% decrease in [18F]AV-1451 binding in the midbrain of PD patients. A total of 12 patients and 10 healthy age-matched controls were recruited. An anatomical MRI and a 90-min PET scan, using [18F]AV-1451, were acquired from all participants. The standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) from 60 to 90 min post-injection was calculated for the substantia nigra, using the cerebellar cortex as the reference region. The substantia nigra was delineated using automated region of interest software. An independent samples ANOVA and LSD post hoc testing were used to test for differences in [18F]AV-1451 SUVR between groups.

We therefore wanted to study the retention patterns of 18F-AV-1451 in PD, PD-dementia (PDD), and DLB. To do this 44 healthy controls, 11 non-demented patients with PD, 18 patients with PDD, and six patients with DLB underwent MRI and 18F-AV-1451 PET scanning and cognitive testing. We found that parietal 18F-AV-1451 retention was increased in patients with DLB compared to controls and PD patients, while 18F-AV-1451 uptake was reduced in the substantia nigra in PDD. Increased parietal 18F-AV-1451 PET uptake was associated with impaired performance on verbal fluency tests, and the decreased uptake in the substantia nigra correlated with worse motor function. We found no effect of the monoamine oxidase B inhibitor rasagiline on 18F-AV-1451 binding. In conclusion DLB patients have increased parietal 18F-AV-1451 uptake. Increased parietal tau is associated with executive impairment in patients with synucleinopathies, while decreased uptake in the substantia nigra is associated with parkinsonism. Further, our data indicate that 18F-AV-1451 does not significantly bind to MAO-B in vivo.",

        "# Title: PET Imaging of Astrogliosis and Tau Facilitates Diagnosis of Parkinsonian Syndromes.\n# Abstract: Neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes comprise a number of disorders that are characterized by similar clinical features but are separated on the basis of different pathologies, i.e., aggregates of α-synuclein or tau protein. Due to the overlap of signs and symptoms a precise differentiation is often difficult, especially early in the disease course. Enormous efforts have been taken to develop tau-selective PET imaging agents, but strong off-target binding to monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) has been observed across first generation ligands. Nonetheless, astrogliosis-related MAO-B elevation is a common histopathological known feature of all parkinsonian syndromes and might be itself an interesting imaging target. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the performance of [18F]-THK5351, a combined MAO-B and tau tracer for differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes. [18F]-THK5351 PET was performed in 34 patients: six with Parkinson's disease (PD), nine with multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P), six with MSA with predominant cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C), and 13 with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) Richardson's syndrome. Volume-of-interest-based quantification of standardized-uptake-values was conducted in different parkinsonian syndrome-related target regions. PET results were subjected to multinomial logistic regression to create a prediction model discriminating among groups. Furthermore, we correlated tracer uptake with clinical findings. Elevated [18F]-THK5351 uptake in midbrain and diencephalon differentiated PSP patients from PD and MSA-C. MSA-C patients were distinguishable by high tracer uptake in the pons and cerebellar deep white matter when compared to PSP and PD patients, whereas MSA-P patients tended to show higher tracer uptake in the lentiform nucleus. A multinomial logistic regression classified 33/34 patients into the correct clinical diagnosis group. Tracer uptake in the pons, cerebellar deep white matter, and striatum was closely associated with the presence of cerebellar and parkinsonian symptoms of MSA patients. The current study demonstrates that combined MAO-B and tau binding of THK5351 facilitates differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes. Furthermore, our data indicate a correlation of MSA phenotype with [18F]-THK5351 uptake in certain brain regions, illustrating their relevance for the emergence of clinical symptoms and underlining the potential of THK5351 PET as a biomarker that correlates with pathological changes as well as with disease stage.",

We aimed to investigate its performance in combination with plasma tau levels in patients with non-AD tauopathy. Methods: A total of 47 participants were enrolled, including 10 healthy controls, 16 with tauopathy parkinsonism syndromes (9 with corticobasal syndrome [CBS], 7 with progressive supranuclear palsy [PSP]), 9 with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 4 with AD, and 8 with Parkinson's disease (PD). All participants underwent clinical assessments, 18F-T807 tau PET, brain MRI, and plasma tau assay. Results: The global cortical standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) of 18F-T807 PET was comparable between PD and control (p = 0.088). The cortical SUVR was significantly higher in AD group (p = 0.002) but was modestly increased in PSP group compared to the PD group (p = 0.044), especially in parietal and pallidal regions. Asymmetric 18F-T807 uptake at the pallidum was noted in patients with CBS and FTD. Cortical tau tracer uptake was associated with increased plasma total tau level (p = 0.016), especially in frontal and parietal regions. Regional tracer uptake was correlated with cortical thinning in patients with CBS and PSP (CBS: r = -0.092, p = 0.025; PSP: r = -0.114, p = 0.015). Conclusions: The 18F-T807 tau tracer uptake was only modestly increased in patients with PSP. Although the cortical tau tracer uptake correlated with regional cortical atrophy and plasma tau levels, a four-repeated tau-specific tracer is needed for future classifying tauopathy parkinsonism syndromes.",

We sought to evaluate the predictive role of frailty in an observational cohort study of inpatients with decompensated cirrhosis between 2010 and 2013. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included discharge to a rehabilitation hospital, 30-day readmission, and length of stay. Frailty was assessed with three metrics: activities of daily living (ADL), the Braden Scale, and the Morse fall risk score. A predictive model was validated by randomly dividing the population into training and validation cohorts: 734 patients were admitted 1358 times in the study period. The overall 90-day mortality was 18.3%. The 30-day readmission rate was 26.6%, and the rate of discharge to a rehabilitation facility was 14.3%. Adjusting for sex, age, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, sodium, and Charlson index, the odds ratio for the effect of an ADL score of less than 12 of 15 on mortality is 1.83 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-3.20). A predictive model for 90-day mortality including ADL and Braden Scale yielded C statistics of 0.83 (95% CI 0.80-0.86) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.71-0.83) in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Discharge to a rehabilitation hospital is predicted by both the ADL (<12) and Braden Scale (<16), with respective adjusted odds ratios of 3.78 (95% CI 1.97-7.29) and 6.23 (95% CI 2.53-15.4).

However, for patients with compensated disease, data are limited regarding associations with poor patient-reported outcomes (PROs). We prospectively enrolled 300 patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension without a history of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and reviewed medical and pharmacy records. We characterized determinants of PROs using the 8-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-8) scale (0-100) and sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; poor sleep >5). Disability and frailty measures were assessed using activities of daily living (ADLs), falls, hand-grip, and chair-stands. Cognitive function was measured using weighted-lures from the Inhibitory Control Test (ICT). The median age of our cohort was 60 (interquartile range [IQR], 52-66) years, 56.3% were male, and 70% Child class A. All patients had portal hypertension, 76% had varices, and 41% had a history of ascites (predominantly well controlled). The median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease with Sodium (MELD-Na) score was 9 (IQR, 7-13). The overall median SF-8 was 70 (IQR, 54-86). Multivariate analysis showed that after adjusting for age, sex, education, and MELD-Na, performance on chair-stands (9.28 HRQOL points [95% confidence interval {CI}, 4.76-13.8] per 10-stands), ADL dependence (-6.06 [-10.8 to -1.36]), opiate use (-5.01 [-7.84 to -2.19]), benzodiazepine use (-3.50 [-6.58 to -0.42]), and ICT performance (-0.10 [-0.20 to 0.001] per weighted-lure) were significantly associated with HRQOL. Among patients completing the ICT, poor HRQOL (score <50) was significantly associated with chair-stands (odds ratio [OR] per 10-stands, 0.24; 95% CI [0.11-0.56]) and weighted lures (OR per weighted-lure, 1.01 [1.00-1.03]). Poor sleep quality was associated with opiate use (OR, 2.85 [1.11-7.29]) and lures (OR per-lure, 1.03 [1.00-1.05]).

The role of baseline frailty has not been assessed in this context. We evaluated the association between patient frailty and postoperative risk among diverse patients with cirrhosis and determined if frailty improves prognostication of cirrhosis surgical risk scores. This was a retrospective cohort study of U.S. veterans with cirrhosis identified between 2008 and 2016 who underwent nontransplant major surgery. Frailty was ascertained using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS). Cox regression analysis was used to investigate the impact of patient frailty on postoperative mortality. Logistic regression was used to identify incremental changes in discrimination for postoperative mortality when frailty was added to the risk prediction models, including the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), MELD-sodium (MELD-Na), Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP), Mayo Risk Score (MRS), and Veterans Outcomes and Costs Associated With Liver Disease (VOCAL)-Penn. A total of 804 cirrhosis surgeries were identified. The majority of patients (48.5%) had high-risk frailty at baseline (HFRS >15). In adjusted Cox regression models, categories of increasing frailty scores were associated with poorer postoperative survival. For example, intermediate-risk frailty (HFRS 5-15) conferred a 1.77-fold increased hazard relative to low-risk frailty (HFRS, <5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-2.95; P = 0.03). High-risk frailty demonstrated a similarly increased hazard (hazard ratio, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.05-2.88; P = 0.03), suggesting a threshold effect of frailty on postoperative mortality. The incorporation of frailty improved discrimination of MELD, MELD-Na, and CTP for postoperative mortality, but did not do so for the MRS or VOCAL-Penn score. Patient frailty was an additional important predictor of cirrhosis surgical risk. The incorporation of preoperative frailty assessments may help to risk stratify patients, especially in settings where the MELD-Na and CTP are commonly applied.",

        "# Title: Inpatient Frailty Assessment Is Feasible and Predicts Nonhome Discharge and Mortality in Decompensated Cirrhosis.\n# Abstract: Objective inpatient frailty assessments in decompensated cirrhosis are understudied. We examined the feasibility of inpatient frailty measurements and associations with nonhome discharge, readmission, and all-cause mortality among patients admitted for cirrhosis complications. We conducted a prospective study at 3 liver transplantation (LT) centers. Frailty was assessed using the liver frailty index (LFI). Multivariable logistic and competing risk models evaluated associations between frailty and clinical outcomes. We included 211 patients with median MELD-Na score 21 (interquartile range [IQR],15-27); 96 (45%) were women, and 102 (48%) were on the LT waiting list. At a median follow-up of 8.3 months, 29 patients (14%) were nonhome discharged, 144 (68%) were readmitted, 70 (33%) underwent LT, and 44 (21%) died. A total of 124 patients (59%) were frail, with a median LFI of 4.71 (IQR, 4.07-5.54). Frail patients were older (mean, 59 versus 54 years) and more likely to have chronic kidney disease (40% versus 20%; P = 0.002) and coronary artery disease (17% versus 7%; P = 0.03). Frailty was associated with hospital-acquired infections (8% versus 1%; P = 0.02). In multivariable models, LFI was associated with nonhome discharge (odds ratio, 1.81 per 1-point increase; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-2.86). Frailty (LFI≥4.5) was associated with all-cause mortality in models accounting for LT as competing risk (subhazard ratio [sHR], 2.4; 95% CI, 1.13-5.11); results were similar with LFI as a continuous variable (sHR, 1.62 per 1-point increase; 95% CI, 1.15-2.28). A brief, objective inpatient frailty assessment was feasible and predicted nonhome discharge and mortality in decompensated cirrhosis. Inpatient point-of-care frailty assessment prior to hospital discharge can be useful for risk stratification and targeted interventions to improve physical fitness and reduce adverse outcomes.",

        "# Title: Health-Related Quality of Life and Its Contributors According to a Preference-Based Generic Instrument in Cirrhosis.\n# Abstract: It is essential to determine contributors around impairment in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with cirrhosis aiming at improving health care and therapeutic strategy. Studies simultaneously incorporating disease severity based on biochemical parameters and other physical/psychological effects (i.e., sleep disturbance and frailty) are heterogeneous and the subject of the present study. We analyzed and compared HRQoL, using the EuroQol Group 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire and the utility index retrieved, in patients with cirrhosis and across groups stratified by sleep disturbance or frailty phenotype. Sleep disturbance and frailty were determined by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Frailty Index, respectively. Multiple linear regression was implemented to clarify contributors of poor HRQoL. In this cohort of 227 patients with mean age of 61.7 years and 47.2% male, more than half of the study population represented impairment in HRQoL in at least one domain, according to EQ-5D. Furthermore, sleep disturbance and frailty have proved to be independently associated with poor HRQoL in two separate regression models, whereas conventional scoring systems such as Child-Pugh classification and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease are not closely relevant. Intriguingly, not all health domains within EQ-5D correlated well with PSQI and Frailty Index, with the exception of usual activities. Pain and anxiety/depression were the most frequently affected HRQoL domains even in patients without sleep disturbance or frailty. Conclusion: Impaired HRQoL is prevalent in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Sleep disturbance and frailty are independently associated with poor HRQoL. It is imperative to timely intervene with these symptoms and deliver tailored health care.",

        "# Title: Liver Frailty Index for Prediction of Short-Term Rehospitalization in Patients with Liver Cirrhosis.\n# Abstract: Background: Stratifying patients with liver cirrhosis for risk of rehospitalization is challenging with established scoring systems for chronic liver disease. Frailty captures the physical characteristics of patients with cirrhosis. Its value for predicting short-term rehospitalizations in hospitalized patients remains to be defined. Methods: Eighty-three non-electively hospitalized patients with liver cirrhosis were analyzed in this study. Frailty was assessed during the last 48 h of hospital stay with the liver frailty index (LFI). Patients were followed for 30-day rehospitalization. Results: In total, 26 (31%) patients were rehospitalized within 30 days. The median LFI was 4.5, and 43 (52%) patients were identified as frail. Rehospitalized patients had a significant higher LFI compared to patients without a rehospitalization within 30 days. In multivariable analysis, LFI as a metric variable (OR 2.36, p = 0.02) and lower platelet count (OR 0.98, p < 0.01) were independently associated with rehospitalization. LFI and its subtest chair stands had the best discriminative ability to predict rehospitalization, with AUROCs of 0.66 and 0.67, respectively. An LFI cut-off of >4.62 discriminated best between patients with and without elevated risk for rehospitalization within 30 days. Conclusions: Measures of frailty could be useful to identify patients at higher risk for short-term rehospitalization.",

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a cross-sectional study involving individuals aged 32 to 69 years, all diagnosed with liver cirrhosis. The chronic liver disease questionnaire (CLDQ) was used to assess HR-QoL, the CLDQ score was used as an outcome to measure the factors related to HR-QoL, and the liver frailty index (LFI) was used to assess the frailty status. The association between the frailty status and the CLDQ summary scales was investigated using the correlation coefficient and multiple regression analyses. A total of 138 patients in the frail (n = 62) and non-frail (n = 76) groups with (alcohol: 97; viral: 24; autoimmune: 17; and cryptogenic: 12) were included in the study. Age, CTP score, and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) sodium were significantly higher in the frail group. In the CLDQ domains, there was a significant difference between the frail and non-frail groups (p value = 0.001). In health-related quality-of-life summary measures, there was a strong negative correlation between frailty and the scores for activities, emotional function, and fatigue (p value = 0.001). When comparing frail to non-frail patients, these characteristics demonstrated significantly increased odds as indicated by their adjusted odds ratios: OR 3.339 (p value = 0.013), OR 3.998 (p value = 0.006), and OR 4.626 (p value = 0.002), respectively."

Patients were assessed by interview, full rheumatological and neurological examination, 14 days post stroke, for a history of shoulder pain according to predetermined criteria. In addition, Barthel Index, HAD score and pain scores were also recorded. Twenty-five percent of patients developed shoulder pain within 2 weeks of their stroke. There was a statistically significant association with ipsilateral sensory impairment (p < 0.005), abnormal rheumatological examination (p < 0.001) and depression score (p < 0.005).

We sought to evaluate the predictive role of frailty in an observational cohort study of inpatients with decompensated cirrhosis between 2010 and 2013. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included discharge to a rehabilitation hospital, 30-day readmission, and length of stay. Frailty was assessed with three metrics: activities of daily living (ADL), the Braden Scale, and the Morse fall risk score. A predictive model was validated by randomly dividing the population into training and validation cohorts: 734 patients were admitted 1358 times in the study period. The overall 90-day mortality was 18.3%. The 30-day readmission rate was 26.6%, and the rate of discharge to a rehabilitation facility was 14.3%. Adjusting for sex, age, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, sodium, and Charlson index, the odds ratio for the effect of an ADL score of less than 12 of 15 on mortality is 1.83 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-3.20). A predictive model for 90-day mortality including ADL and Braden Scale yielded C statistics of 0.83 (95% CI 0.80-0.86) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.71-0.83) in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Discharge to a rehabilitation hospital is predicted by both the ADL (<12) and Braden Scale (<16), with respective adjusted odds ratios of 3.78 (95% CI 1.97-7.29) and 6.23 (95% CI 2.53-15.4).

However, for patients with compensated disease, data are limited regarding associations with poor patient-reported outcomes (PROs). We prospectively enrolled 300 patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension without a history of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and reviewed medical and pharmacy records. We characterized determinants of PROs using the 8-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-8) scale (0-100) and sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; poor sleep >5). Disability and frailty measures were assessed using activities of daily living (ADLs), falls, hand-grip, and chair-stands. Cognitive function was measured using weighted-lures from the Inhibitory Control Test (ICT). The median age of our cohort was 60 (interquartile range [IQR], 52-66) years, 56.3% were male, and 70% Child class A. All patients had portal hypertension, 76% had varices, and 41% had a history of ascites (predominantly well controlled). The median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease with Sodium (MELD-Na) score was 9 (IQR, 7-13). The overall median SF-8 was 70 (IQR, 54-86). Multivariate analysis showed that after adjusting for age, sex, education, and MELD-Na, performance on chair-stands (9.28 HRQOL points [95% confidence interval {CI}, 4.76-13.8] per 10-stands), ADL dependence (-6.06 [-10.8 to -1.36]), opiate use (-5.01 [-7.84 to -2.19]), benzodiazepine use (-3.50 [-6.58 to -0.42]), and ICT performance (-0.10 [-0.20 to 0.001] per weighted-lure) were significantly associated with HRQOL. Among patients completing the ICT, poor HRQOL (score <50) was significantly associated with chair-stands (odds ratio [OR] per 10-stands, 0.24; 95% CI [0.11-0.56]) and weighted lures (OR per weighted-lure, 1.01 [1.00-1.03]). Poor sleep quality was associated with opiate use (OR, 2.85 [1.11-7.29]) and lures (OR per-lure, 1.03 [1.00-1.05]).

Frailty was ascertained using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS). Cox regression analysis was used to investigate the impact of patient frailty on postoperative mortality. Logistic regression was used to identify incremental changes in discrimination for postoperative mortality when frailty was added to the risk prediction models, including the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), MELD-sodium (MELD-Na), Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP), Mayo Risk Score (MRS), and Veterans Outcomes and Costs Associated With Liver Disease (VOCAL)-Penn. A total of 804 cirrhosis surgeries were identified. The majority of patients (48.5%) had high-risk frailty at baseline (HFRS >15). In adjusted Cox regression models, categories of increasing frailty scores were associated with poorer postoperative survival. For example, intermediate-risk frailty (HFRS 5-15) conferred a 1.77-fold increased hazard relative to low-risk frailty (HFRS, <5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-2.95; P = 0.03). High-risk frailty demonstrated a similarly increased hazard (hazard ratio, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.05-2.88; P = 0.03), suggesting a threshold effect of frailty on postoperative mortality. The incorporation of frailty improved discrimination of MELD, MELD-Na, and CTP for postoperative mortality, but did not do so for the MRS or VOCAL-Penn score. Patient frailty was an additional important predictor of cirrhosis surgical risk. The incorporation of preoperative frailty assessments may help to risk stratify patients, especially in settings where the MELD-Na and CTP are commonly applied.",

        "# Title: Inpatient Frailty Assessment Is Feasible and Predicts Nonhome Discharge and Mortality in Decompensated Cirrhosis.\n# Abstract: Objective inpatient frailty assessments in decompensated cirrhosis are understudied. We examined the feasibility of inpatient frailty measurements and associations with nonhome discharge, readmission, and all-cause mortality among patients admitted for cirrhosis complications. We conducted a prospective study at 3 liver transplantation (LT) centers. Frailty was assessed using the liver frailty index (LFI). Multivariable logistic and competing risk models evaluated associations between frailty and clinical outcomes. We included 211 patients with median MELD-Na score 21 (interquartile range [IQR],15-27); 96 (45%) were women, and 102 (48%) were on the LT waiting list. At a median follow-up of 8.3 months, 29 patients (14%) were nonhome discharged, 144 (68%) were readmitted, 70 (33%) underwent LT, and 44 (21%) died. A total of 124 patients (59%) were frail, with a median LFI of 4.71 (IQR, 4.07-5.54). Frail patients were older (mean, 59 versus 54 years) and more likely to have chronic kidney disease (40% versus 20%; P = 0.002) and coronary artery disease (17% versus 7%; P = 0.03). Frailty was associated with hospital-acquired infections (8% versus 1%; P = 0.02). In multivariable models, LFI was associated with nonhome discharge (odds ratio, 1.81 per 1-point increase; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-2.86). Frailty (LFI≥4.5) was associated with all-cause mortality in models accounting for LT as competing risk (subhazard ratio [sHR], 2.4; 95% CI, 1.13-5.11); results were similar with LFI as a continuous variable (sHR, 1.62 per 1-point increase; 95% CI, 1.15-2.28). A brief, objective inpatient frailty assessment was feasible and predicted nonhome discharge and mortality in decompensated cirrhosis. Inpatient point-of-care frailty assessment prior to hospital discharge can be useful for risk stratification and targeted interventions to improve physical fitness and reduce adverse outcomes.",

        "# Title: Health-Related Quality of Life and Its Contributors According to a Preference-Based Generic Instrument in Cirrhosis.\n# Abstract: It is essential to determine contributors around impairment in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with cirrhosis aiming at improving health care and therapeutic strategy. Studies simultaneously incorporating disease severity based on biochemical parameters and other physical/psychological effects (i.e., sleep disturbance and frailty) are heterogeneous and the subject of the present study. We analyzed and compared HRQoL, using the EuroQol Group 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire and the utility index retrieved, in patients with cirrhosis and across groups stratified by sleep disturbance or frailty phenotype. Sleep disturbance and frailty were determined by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Frailty Index, respectively. Multiple linear regression was implemented to clarify contributors of poor HRQoL. In this cohort of 227 patients with mean age of 61.7 years and 47.2% male, more than half of the study population represented impairment in HRQoL in at least one domain, according to EQ-5D. Furthermore, sleep disturbance and frailty have proved to be independently associated with poor HRQoL in two separate regression models, whereas conventional scoring systems such as Child-Pugh classification and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease are not closely relevant. Intriguingly, not all health domains within EQ-5D correlated well with PSQI and Frailty Index, with the exception of usual activities. Pain and anxiety/depression were the most frequently affected HRQoL domains even in patients without sleep disturbance or frailty. Conclusion: Impaired HRQoL is prevalent in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Sleep disturbance and frailty are independently associated with poor HRQoL. It is imperative to timely intervene with these symptoms and deliver tailored health care.",

        "# Title: Liver Frailty Index for Prediction of Short-Term Rehospitalization in Patients with Liver Cirrhosis.\n# Abstract: Background: Stratifying patients with liver cirrhosis for risk of rehospitalization is challenging with established scoring systems for chronic liver disease. Frailty captures the physical characteristics of patients with cirrhosis. Its value for predicting short-term rehospitalizations in hospitalized patients remains to be defined. Methods: Eighty-three non-electively hospitalized patients with liver cirrhosis were analyzed in this study. Frailty was assessed during the last 48 h of hospital stay with the liver frailty index (LFI). Patients were followed for 30-day rehospitalization. Results: In total, 26 (31%) patients were rehospitalized within 30 days. The median LFI was 4.5, and 43 (52%) patients were identified as frail. Rehospitalized patients had a significant higher LFI compared to patients without a rehospitalization within 30 days. In multivariable analysis, LFI as a metric variable (OR 2.36, p = 0.02) and lower platelet count (OR 0.98, p < 0.01) were independently associated with rehospitalization. LFI and its subtest chair stands had the best discriminative ability to predict rehospitalization, with AUROCs of 0.66 and 0.67, respectively. An LFI cut-off of >4.62 discriminated best between patients with and without elevated risk for rehospitalization within 30 days. Conclusions: Measures of frailty could be useful to identify patients at higher risk for short-term rehospitalization.",

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a cross-sectional study involving individuals aged 32 to 69 years, all diagnosed with liver cirrhosis. The chronic liver disease questionnaire (CLDQ) was used to assess HR-QoL, the CLDQ score was used as an outcome to measure the factors related to HR-QoL, and the liver frailty index (LFI) was used to assess the frailty status. The association between the frailty status and the CLDQ summary scales was investigated using the correlation coefficient and multiple regression analyses. A total of 138 patients in the frail (n = 62) and non-frail (n = 76) groups with (alcohol: 97; viral: 24; autoimmune: 17; and cryptogenic: 12) were included in the study. Age, CTP score, and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) sodium were significantly higher in the frail group. In the CLDQ domains, there was a significant difference between the frail and non-frail groups (p value = 0.001). In health-related quality-of-life summary measures, there was a strong negative correlation between frailty and the scores for activities, emotional function, and fatigue (p value = 0.001). When comparing frail to non-frail patients, these characteristics demonstrated significantly increased odds as indicated by their adjusted odds ratios: OR 3.339 (p value = 0.013), OR 3.998 (p value = 0.006), and OR 4.626 (p value = 0.002), respectively."

Four hundred twenty-nine patients had migraine, of which 16.5% reported that headaches could be precipitated by cheese or chocolate, and nearly always both. Of the migraine patients, 18.4% reported sensitivity to all alcoholic drinks, while another 11.8% were sensitive to red wine but not to white wine; 28% of the migrainous patients reported that beer would precipitate headaches. There was a definite statistical association between sensitivity to cheese/chocolate and to red wine (P < 0.001) and also to beer (P < 0.001), but none between diet sensitivity and sensitivity to alcoholic drinks in general. None of 40 patients with tension headache (diagnosed by International Headache Society criteria) reported sensitivity to foods, and only one was sensitive to alcoholic drinks. The prevalence of sensitivity among 46 patients with some migrainous features was intermediate between the migraine and tension headache categories. It is concluded that cheese/chocolate and red wine sensitivity, in particular, have closely related mechanisms, in some way related more to migraine than to more chronic tension-type headache, while quite separate mechanisms play a major role in sensitivity to alcoholic drinks in general.",

The Head-HUNT Study.\n# Abstract: The aim of this study was to examine a possible association between smoking, alcohol and headache in a large population-based cross-sectional study. A total of 51,383 subjects completed a headache questionnaire and constituted the 'Head-HUNT' Study. Questionnaire-based information on smoking was available in 95% and on alcohol in 89% of the individuals. Associations were assessed in multivariate analyses, estimating prevalence odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Prevalence rates for headache were higher amongst smokers compared with never smokers, most evident for those under 40 years smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.6). Passive smoking was also associated with higher headache prevalence. For alcohol use, there was a tendency of decreasing prevalence of migraine with increasing amounts of alcohol consumption compared with alcohol abstinence. Only with regard to symptoms indicating alcohol overuse, a positive association with frequent headache was found. The association between headache and smoking found in the present study raises questions about a causal relationship, e.g. that smoking causes headache or that it allays stress induced by headache. The observed negative association between migraine and alcohol consumption is probably explained by the headache precipitating properties of alcohol.",

However, the contributions of lncRNAs to gastric carcinoma and their functional mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that lncRNA gastric carcinoma high expressed transcript 1 (lncRNA-GHET1) was up-regulated in gastric carcinoma. The over-expression of this lncRNA correlates with tumor size, tumor invasion and poor survival. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses demonstrated that GHET1 over-expression promotes the proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of GHET1 inhibits the proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells. RNA pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that GHET1 physically associates with insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) and enhances the physical interaction between c-Myc mRNA and IGF2BP1, consequently increasing the stability of c-Myc mRNA and expression. The expression of GHET1 and c-Myc is strongly correlated in gastric carcinoma tissues. Depletion of c-Myc abolishes the effects of GHET1 on proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that GHET1 plays a pivotal role in gastric carcinoma cell proliferation via increasing c-Myc mRNA stability and expression, which suggests potential use of GHET1 for the prognosis and treatment of gastric carcinoma.",

A growing volume of literature has implicated the vital role of long noncoding RNA in the development of cancer. GHET1, a recently identified lncRNA, was initially characterized in gastric cancer. However, its role in bladder cancer remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that GHET1 was upregulated in bladder cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues and its over-expression correlates with tumor size, advanced tumor and lymph node status, and poor survival. GHET1 knockdown suppressed the proliferation and invasion of bladder cancer cells in vitro. In the meantime, inhibition of GHET1 reversed the epithelial-mesenchymal-transition in bladder cancer cell line.

Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) attract much attention of researchers, and they are demonstrated to be dysregulated in a variety of cancers, including HCC. LncRNA gastric carcinoma high expressed transcript 1 lncRNA GHET1 is found to be dysregulated in gastric cancer (GC). However, its clinical value and potential biological function in HCC remains unclear. In this study, the expression level of GHET1 was analyzed in 72 HCC tissues and matched normal tissues by using Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). GHET1 expression was significantly up-regulated in HCC tissues and the higher level of GHET1 was related to vascular invasion, cirrhosis, tumor size, edmindson grade, and poor prognosis. Moreover, knockdown of GHET1 inhibited cell proliferation of HCC, and also caused cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis in HCC cell lines. We also found that GHET1 could epigenetically repress transcription of Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) in HCC cells by recruiting PRC2 into KLF2 promoter region. Our results indicated that lncRNA GHET1, as a growth regulator, might serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and therapy target for HCC.",

However, the function and underlying mechanisms of lncRNA GHET1 in gastric cancer are not fully understood. In this study, the expression of GHET1 was investigated in gastric cancer and it was determined whether GHET1 may potentially be used as a biomarker for the disease. The gastric cancer cell lines MGC‑803 and AGS were transfected with GHET1‑directed small interfering RNA (siRNA) and the changes in phenotype and cell‑cycle‑related molecules were assessed. The downregulation of GHET1 induced G0/G1‑phase arrest in gastric cancer cells and inhibited their proliferation, migration, and invasion. DNA synthesis and the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) decreased, which was consistent with the results of the CCK‑8 assay. The levels of specific cell‑cycle regulators were determined and the expression and activities of positive cell‑cycle regulators (cyclin D, CDK4, CDK6, cyclin E, CDK2) were reduced, whereas those of a negative regulator (P21) were increased in GHET1‑knockdown cells. Taken together, the present findings show that the downregulation of GHET1 not only inhibits the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells, but also inhibits their proliferation, at least in part by upregulating P21 expression and downregulating cyclin and CDK expression to inhibit the G0/G1 to S phase transition. The present findings may provide a potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer."

LTBI is detected using interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) or the tuberculin-skin-test (TST). In clinical practice, IGRAs and the TSTs have failed to distinguish between active tuberculosis and LTBI and their predictive value to identify individuals at risk for the future development of tuberculosis is limited. There is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that improve the clinical performance of current immunodiagnostic methods for tuberculosis prevention, diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Here, we review the landscape of potential alternative biomarkers useful for detection of infection with M. tuberculosis. We describe what individual markers add in terms of specificity for active/latent infection, prediction of progression to active tuberculosis and immunodiagnostic potential in high-risk groups' such as HIV-infected individuals and children.",

Numerous cytokines and regulator factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis and control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Additional cytokines and chemokines associated with M. tuberculosis infection may improve the performance of IFN-γ release assays. We developed a real-time RT-PCR TaqMan assay for targeting levels of eight human targets [IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-10, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11] and evaluated the assay with three different study groups. Results showed that the sensitivity of TNF-α, IL-2R, and CXCL10 in the active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) group was 96.43%, 96.43%, and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity of IL-2R and CXCL10 in the latent tuberculosis infection group was 86.36% and 81.82%, respectively. Statistical results showed that TNF-α and CXCL9 were the best individual markers for differentiating between the PTB, LTBI, and non-TB groups. For optimal sensitivity and differentiation of M. tuberculosis infection status, the simultaneous detection of multiple targets was attempted. The combination of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2R, and the combination of TNF-α, IL-2R, CXCL9, and CXCL10 showed the best performance for detecting active PTB (both 100% positivity) and LTBI (86.36% and 81.82% positivity, respectively). These results imply that the combination of suitable markers is useful in efficiently diagnosing TB and differentiating M. tuberculosis infection status.",

We evaluated the potentials of 74 host markers as biomarkers for the immunological diagnosis of tuberculosis and monitoring of treatment response. Fifty-five individuals that presented with signs and symptoms requiring investigation for tuberculosis disease were prospectively recruited prior to clinical diagnosis, at a health centre in Cape Town, South Africa. Patients were later classified as having tuberculosis disease or other respiratory diseases (ORD) using a combination of clinical, radiological and laboratory findings. Out of 74 host markers that were evaluated in plasma samples from study participants using a multiplex platform, 18 showed potential as tuberculosis diagnostic candidates with the most promising being NCAM, CRP, SAP, IP-10, ferritin, TPA, I-309, and MIG, which diagnosed tuberculosis disease individually, with area under the ROC curve ≥0.80. Six-marker biosignatures containing NCAM diagnosed tuberculosis disease with a sensitivity of 100% (95%CI, 86.3-100%) and specificity of 89.3% (95%CI, 67.6-97.3%) irrespective of HIV status, and 100% accuracy in the absence of HIV infection. Furthermore, the concentrations of 11 of these proteins changed with treatment, thereby indicating that they may be useful in monitoring of the response to tuberculosis treatment.

Seventy-nine individuals, 27 active TB, 32 latent infection subsets, 20 individuals derivative purified protein (PPD) negative (subjects that do not have any indurative cutaneous reaction after 72 hrs of intradermal injection of PPD) and with other pulmonary disease were retrospectively studied. Forty-eight analytes were evaluated by Luminex Assay in plasma obtained from whole blood stimulated cells. The diagnostic accuracies of the markers detected were evaluated by ROC curve analysis and by the combination of multiple biomarkers to improve the potential to discriminate between infection/disease and non infection. Among 48 cytokines, 13 analytes, namely IL-3, IL-12-p40, LIF, IFNα2, IL-2ra, IL-13, b-NGF, SCF, TNF-β, TRAIL, IL-2, IFN-γ, IP-10, and MIG, were significantly higher in the active TB and LTBI groups, compared to NON-TB patients, while MIF was significantly lower in active TB patients compared to NON-TB and LTBI groups. The diagnostic accuracies of the markers detected in the culture supernatants evaluated by ROC curve analysis revealed that 11 analytes (IL2, IP10, IFN-γ, IL13, MIG, SCF, b-NGF, IL12-p40, TRAIL, IL2 Ra, LIF) discriminated between NON-TB and LTBI groups, with AUC for all analytes ≥0.73, while 14 analytes (IL2, IP10, IFN-γ, MIG, SCF, b-NGF, IL12-p40, TRAIL, IL2Ra, MIF, TNF-β, IL3, IFN-α2, LIF) discriminated between NON-TB and active TB groups, with AUC ≥0.78, that is a moderate, value in terms of accuracy of a diagnostic test. Finally, the combinations of seven biomarkers resulted in the accurate prediction of 88.89% of active TB patients, 82.35% of subjects with latent infection and 90% of non-TB patients, respectively.

Herein, we evaluated plasma chemokines in patients with active tuberculosis (ATB) and after completing treatment (TTB) and compared them to BCG-vaccinated healthy controls (HC). Levels of chemokines were measured by cytometric bead array. Levels of CXCL8, CXCL9 and CXCL10 were higher in ATB patients compared to HC, but they decreased in TTB. Levels of CCL2 and CCL5 in ATB patients were similar to those observed in HC. Thus, the high levels of CXC-chemokines detected during ATB, which can modulate the trafficking of immune cells from the periphery to the site of infection, were reversed by anti-mycobacterial treatment.",

LTBI is detected using interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) or the tuberculin-skin-test (TST). In clinical practice, IGRAs and the TSTs have failed to distinguish between active tuberculosis and LTBI and their predictive value to identify individuals at risk for the future development of tuberculosis is limited. There is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that improve the clinical performance of current immunodiagnostic methods for tuberculosis prevention, diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Here, we review the landscape of potential alternative biomarkers useful for detection of infection with M. tuberculosis. We describe what individual markers add in terms of specificity for active/latent infection, prediction of progression to active tuberculosis and immunodiagnostic potential in high-risk groups' such as HIV-infected individuals and children.",

Numerous cytokines and regulator factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis and control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Additional cytokines and chemokines associated with M. tuberculosis infection may improve the performance of IFN-γ release assays. We developed a real-time RT-PCR TaqMan assay for targeting levels of eight human targets [IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-10, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11] and evaluated the assay with three different study groups. Results showed that the sensitivity of TNF-α, IL-2R, and CXCL10 in the active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) group was 96.43%, 96.43%, and 100%, respectively.

        "# Title: Long-term CD4+ T-cell response to highly active antiretroviral therapy according to baseline CD4+ T-cell count.\n# Abstract: Current treatment guidelines for HIV infection recommend a relatively late initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Nevertheless, there is still a concern that immune recovery may not be as complete once CD4+ T cells have decreased below a certain threshold. This study addressed the long-term response of CD4+ T-cell counts in patients on HAART and analyzed the influence of baseline CD4+ T-cell counts, baseline viral load, and age. An observational analysis of evolution of CD4+ T cells in 861 antiretroviral therapy-naive chronic HIV-1-infected patients who started treatment consisting of at least 3 drugs in or after 1996 was performed. Patients were classified in 4 groups according to baseline CD4+ T cells: <200 cells/mm3, 200-349 cells/mm3, 350-499 cells/mm3, and >or=500 cells/mm3. The main outcome measures were proportion of patients with CD4+ T cells <200/mm3 and >500/mm3 at last determination and rate of CD4+ T-cell recovery. Patients were followed-up for a median of 173 weeks (interquartile range [IQR], 100-234). There were no differences in follow-up between the 4 groups. CD4+ T cells increased in the whole cohort from a median of 214 cells/mm3 (IQR, 90-355) to 499 cells/mm3 (IQR, 312-733) (P<0.001). Compared with the group with a baseline CD4+ T-cell count of >or=500/mm3, the relative risk of having a last determination of CD4+ T-cell counts >200 cells/mm3 was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.75-0.83), 0.92 (95% CI, 0.89-0.96) and 1 for baseline CD4+ T cells <200 cells/mm3, 200-349 cells/mm3, and 350-499 cells/mm3, respectively. The relative risk of having a last determination of CD4+ T-cell counts >500 cells/mm3 was 0.32 (95% CI, 0.27-0.39, P<0.001), 0.69 (95% CI, 0.60-0.79, P<0.001), and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.83-1.06, P=0.38) for baseline CD4+ T-cell counts <200 cells/mm3, 200-349 cells/mm3, and 350-0499 cells/mm3, respectively, compared with a baseline CD4+ T-cell count of >or=500 cells/mm3. The increase in CD4+ T cells from baseline was statistically significant and was maintained for up to 4 years of follow-up. This increase seemed to slow down after approximately 3 years and reached a plateau after 4-5 years of follow-up even in patients who achieved and maintained viral suppression in plasma. Long-term immune recovery is possible regardless of baseline CD4+ T-cell count. However, patients who start therapy with a CD4+ T-cell count <200 cells/mm3 have poorer immunologic outcome as measured by the proportion of patients with CD4+ T cells <200/mm3 or >500/mm3 at last determination. It seems that the immune recovery slows down after approximately 3 years of HAART and reaches a plateau after 4-5 years of HAART.",

Loss of LKB1 promotes cancer progression and influences therapeutic responses in preclinical studies; however, specific targeted therapies for lung cancer with LKB1 inactivation are currently unavailable. Here, we have identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) signature that is associated with the loss of LKB1 function. We discovered that LINC00473 is consistently the most highly induced gene in LKB1-inactivated human primary NSCLC samples and derived cell lines. Elevated LINC00473 expression correlated with poor prognosis, and sustained LINC00473 expression was required for the growth and survival of LKB1-inactivated NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, LINC00473 was induced by LKB1 inactivation and subsequent cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)/CREB-regulated transcription coactivator (CRTC) activation. We determined that LINC00473 is a nuclear lncRNA and interacts with NONO, a component of the cAMP signaling pathway, thereby facilitating CRTC/CREB-mediated transcription. Collectively, our study demonstrates that LINC00473 expression potentially serves as a robust biomarker for tumor LKB1 functional status that can be integrated into clinical trials for patient selection and treatment evaluation, and implicates LINC00473 as a therapeutic target for LKB1-inactivated NSCLC.",

However, neither the expression pattern nor the biological functions of LINC00473 have been elucidated in cervical cancer so far. In the present study, gain- and loss-of-function assays showed that LINC00473 promoted cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis in cervical cancer cells in vitro. Moreover, we found that LINC00473 enhanced the growth of cervical cancer cells in vivo. Mechanistic investigation showed that LINC00473 directly interacted with ILF2 and suppressed its degradation.

Recent studies reported that lncRNA LINC00473 (LNC473) was involved in cancer progression. However, the clinical significance and functional role of LNC473 in HCC progression is still unknown. In the present study, we found that the LNC473 expression was markedly elevated in HCC tissues and correlated with bigger tumor size, higher BCLC stage, vascular invasion and poor prognosis. Gain- and loss-of-function assay showed that LNC473 enhanced HCC cell proliferation and invasion and induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Mechanistically, LNC473 associated with oncoprotein survivin and regulates its stability. Moreover, LNC473 could recruit deubiquitinase USP9X to inhibit the ubiquitination level of survivin and then increase survivin expression. Therefore, our results suggest that LNC473 exerts its functions as an oncogene in HCC progression and may be a therapeutic target for HCC treatment.",

However, the clinical value and biological function of LINC00473 in gastric cancer (GC) was still unknown. In our results, LINC00473 expression was increased in GC tissue samples and GC cell lines compared with paired adjacent normal stomach tissue samples and normal gastric epithelial cell line, respectively. High-expression of LINC00473 was correlated with poor histological type, advanced clinical stage, more lymph node metastasis and present distant metastasis. The results of Kaplan-Meier analysis and TCGA database similarly suggested that GC patients with LINC00473 high-expression had poorer prognosis than GC patients with LINC00473 low-expression. Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that LINC00473 high-expression served as independent unfavorable prognostic factor for overall survival in GC patients. The study in vitro indicated that silencing of LINC00473 had no effect on GC cell viability, but inhibited GC cell migration and invasion through modulating MMP2 and MMP9 expression. In conclusion, LINC00473 is associated with the malignant status and prognosis in GC cases, and functions as an oncogenic lncRNA to regulate GC cell migration and invasion.",

Overexpression or knockdown of LINC00473 in vitro and functional experiments were performed to study its effects on BC cells. Target prediction, luciferase assays, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and RNA immunoprecipitation were used to verify the role of LINC00473 as a competing endogenous RNA. The impact of LINC00473 on tumor growth was also evaluated using a xenograft model. In our study, we found that LINC00473 was highly expressed in BC tissues and cells, and the elevated expression was correlated with shorter overall survival in patients with BC. Furthermore, knockdown of LINC00473 significantly inhibited the capacity of proliferation, invasion and migration of BC cells. Animal experiment suggested that silencing LINC00473 could significantly inhibit the tumor growth. Following experiments revealed that LINC00473 may function as a competing endogenous RNA to regulate the expression of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1 (MAPK1) through competition for miR-198. Thus, increased expression of LINC00473 in breast cancer tissues is linked to poor prognosis. LINC00473 may function as an endogenous completive RNA by sponging miR-198 to regulate MAPK1 expression. Findings of our study contributed to the basis for further exploring the application of LINC00473 as a prognostic and diagnostic biomarker.",
        "# Title: Long non‑coding RNA LINC00473/miR‑195‑5p promotes glioma progression via YAP1‑TEAD1‑Hippo signaling.\n# Abstract: There is an urgent need to identify novel potential therapeutic targets for diagnosis and treatment of glioma, a common primary tumor in brain, due to its high‑level invasiveness. Long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00473 has been reported as potentially critical regulators in various types of cancer tumorigenesis. However, the effects of LINC00473 on glioma cells is unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the clinical significance, effects and mechanism of LINC00437 on glioma tumorigenesis. In the present study, LINC00473 was significantly increased in glioma tissues and in cell models, and predicted a poor prognosis in patients with glioma. Notably, LINC00473 knockdown not only suppressed cell proliferation, invasion and migration of glioma cells, but also blocked cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis. Subcutaneous xenotransplanted tumor model experiments revealed that reduced LINC00473 expression was able to suppress in vivo glioma growth. Mechanistically, LINC00473 functioned as a competing endogenous (ce)RNA to decrease microRNA (miR)‑195‑5p expression. Moreover, Yes‑associated protein 1 (YAP1) and TEA domain family member 1 (TEAD1) were identified as downstream targets of miR‑195‑5p, whose expression levels were inhibited by miR‑195‑5p. LINC00473 knockdown suppressed glioma progression through the decrease of miR‑195‑5p and subsequent increase of YAP1 and TEAD1 expression levels. These results indicated LINC00473 might act as a ceRNA to sponge miR‑195‑5p, thus promoting YAP1 and TEAD1 expressions, and shedding light on the underlying mechanisms of LINC00473‑induced glioma progression.",
        "# Title: LINC00473 contributes to the radioresistance of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by regulating microRNA‑497‑5p and cell division cycle 25A.\n# Abstract: Long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00473 plays a carcinogenic role in a variety of different tumor types. Nevertheless, the mechanisms through which LINC00473 regulates the radiosensitivity of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells remains elusive. In the present study, reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR was used to quantify the expression of LINC00473, microRNA (miRNA/miR)‑497‑5p and cell division cycle 25A (CDC25A) in ESCC tissues. The association between LINC00473 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with ESCC was also assessed. Furthermore, Cell Counting kit‑8 and colony formation assays were carried out to monitor the proliferation of ESCC cells exposed to X‑ray radiation. A dual‑luciferase reporter assay was also conducted to analyze the interaction between LINC00473 and miR‑497‑5p, as well as the interaction between CDC25A and miR‑497‑5p. The findings of the present study demonstrated that in ESCC tissues and cells, the expression levels of LINC00473 and CDC25A were significantly upregulated, while the expression of miR‑497‑5p was downregulated. The high expression level of LINC00473 was associated with a higher T stage, lymph node metastasis stage and a lower tumor differentiation grade in patients with ESCC. Following irradiation, transfection with miR‑497‑5p mimics reduced the promoting effect of LINC00473 overexpression on ESCC cell proliferation, and partially impeded the resistance of ESCC cells to X‑ray radiation induced by LINC00473 overexpression. Moreover, transfection with miR‑497‑5p inhibitors partially alleviated the inhibitory effects of LINC00473 knockdown on cellular proliferation, and partly reversed the sensitivity of cells to X‑ray irradiation induced by LINC00473 knockdown. Furthermore, it was confirmed that miR‑497‑5p was able to bind LINC00473 and the 3'‑untranslated region of CDC25A. On the whole, the findings of the present study demonstrate that LINC00473 reduces the radiosensitivity of ESCC cells by modulating the miR‑497‑5p/CDC25A axis.",

        "# Title: LNC473 Regulating APAF1 IRES-Dependent Translation via Competitive Sponging miR574 and miR15b: Implications in Colorectal Cancer.\n# Abstract: A growing number of studies have focused on the involvement of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in the internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated translation in tumorigenesis; however, the underlying mechanisms in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain elusive. In this study, we show that LINC00473 (LNC473) exerted its functions as a tumor suppressor in promoting apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF1) IRES activity through competitively sponging miR574-5p and miR15b-5p in CRC initiation and pathogenesis. Specifically, LNC473 and its downstream target APAF1 were significantly downregulated accompanied by upregulated miR574-5p and miR15b-5p in CRC cells and tissues, which had a significant prognostic impact on clinical outcomes in our CRC cohort (n = 157). Furthermore, ectopic LNC473 significantly sponged endogenous miR574-5p or miR15b-5p and thereby inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation capacity, and it accelerated cell apoptosis through activating the APAF1-CASP9-CASP3 pathway. Notably, LNC473 overexpression resulted in dramatic promotion of APAF1 IRES activity and translation, whereas rescue experiments confirmed the recovery by the existence of LNC473 and miR574/15b-5p. Mechanistically, LNC473 overexpression promoted IRES binding domain exposure and removed the constraints controlling from miR574-5p and miR15b-5p, and subsequently enhanced IRES-mediated APAF1 expression in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, our results uncover a novel LNC473-miR574/miR15b-APAF1 signaling axis, which provides new targets and crosstalk regulation mechanism for CRC prevention and treatment.",
        "# Title: Knockdown of LINC00473 promotes radiosensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer cells via sponging miR-513a-3p.\n# Abstract: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung cancer. Radioresistance is a significant obstacle in NSCLC radiotherapy. Long non-coding RNA LINC00473 has been found to impact the radiotherapy in several malignant tumours. This study aimed to investigate the underlying role and mechanism of LINC00473 in regulating radiosensitivity of NSCLC cells. The levels of LINC00473 and miR-513a-3p were measured by quantitative Real-Time PCR. The relationship of LINC00473 with overall survival was tested by the Kaplan-Meier method. The effects of LINC00473 on cell viability and cell survival were assessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony survival assay in NSCLC cells exposed to different doses of radiation. A luciferase reporter assay was used to investigate the correlation between LINC00473 and miR-513a-3p. The present study showed that the relative LINC00473 expression was upregulated and miR-513a-3p expression was downregulated in radioresistant NSCLC patients compared with radiosensitive patients. And upregulated LINC00473 expression was associated with poor prognosis of NSCLC patients after radiotherapy. Radiation led to an increase in LINC00473 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The knockdown of LINC00473 markedly promoted radiosensitivity in NSCLC cells under different doses of radiation. LINC00473 was a sponge of miR-513a-3p and negatively regulated the miR-513a-3p expression. In conclusion, the inhibition of miR-513a-3p markedly reversed the promoted effect of LINC00473 knockdown on cell radiosensitivity. LINC00473 inhibition enhances radiosensitivity of NSCLC by sponging miR-513a-3p, providing a promising therapeutic target to increase the sensitivity of radiotherapy in NSCLC patients.",
        "# Title: lncRNA LINC00473 promotes proliferation, migration, invasion and inhibition of apoptosis of non-small cell lung cancer cells by acting as a sponge of miR-497-5p.\n# Abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-associated death worldwide and exhibits a poor prognosis. The present study aimed to determine the effect of long non-coding (lnc)RNA-LINC00473 on the development of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells by regulating the expression of microRNA (miR)-497-5p. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was conducted to detect the level of LINC00473 and miR-497-5p. An MTT assay, flow cytometry and Transwell tests were performed to evaluate the proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells. Western blotting was performed to detect the expression of apoptosis- and migration-related proteins. RNA immunoprecipitation and a luciferase reporter assay were performed to verify the regulatory relationship between lncRNA-LINC00473 and miR-497-5p. LINC00473 expression was upregulated in lung cancer tissues and NSCLC cells (A549 and H1299) when compared with adjacent tissues or human bronchial epithelial cell lines and the 5-year survival rate was lower in patients with high LINC00473 expression compared with in patients with low LINC00473 expression. A negative correlation between LINC00473 and miR-497-5p was observed in lung cancer tissues. Proliferation, migration and invasion as well as the related protein levels were increased in A549 and H1299 transfected with pcDNA3.1-LINC00473, while the opposite results were obtained in A549 and H1299 transfected with small interfering (si)-LINC00473. Notably, it was demonstrated that LINC00473 could bind directly with miR-497-5p and inhibit its expression. miR-497-5p inhibitors reversed the effect of si-LINC00473. Furthermore, the present study demonstrated that LINC00473 promoted the malignant behaviour of NSCLC cells via regulating the ERK/p38 and MAPK signalling pathways and the expression of miR-497-5p.",
        "# Title: Long intergenic non-coding RNA 00473 promotes proliferation and migration of gastric cancer via the miR-16-5p/CCND2 axis and by regulating AQP3.\n# Abstract: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, but its molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Increasing evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) play a pivotal role in various cancers recently. Our present study focused on exploring the function of long intergenic non-coding RNA 00473 (LINC00473) in GC. In this study, we found that LINC00473 expression was aberrantly increased in tumor tissues compared with the paired para-cancerous tissues. The expression of high LINC00473 in GC was notably correlated with a higher risk of lymphatic metastasis, a higher incidence of vascular cancer embolus, and advanced TNM stage. Further experiments showed that the overexpression of LINC00473 could promote the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells both in vitro and in vivo. The apoptosis of GC cells increased significantly by the decrease of LINC00473. Mechanistically, LINC00473 could sponge miR-16-5p in the cytoplasm and relieve its suppression of CCND2. Moreover, AQP3 was found to be a significant downstream target gene for LINC00473 through RNA transcriptome sequencing, as demonstrated by qRT-PCR and western blot. Overexpression of LINC00473 can partially reverse the effects of AQP3 decrease on GC proliferation and metastasis. LINC00473 regulated AQP3 expression through CREB was confirmed by western blot. Our research indicates that LINC00473/miR-16-5p/CCND2 axis plays a role in the proliferation of GC and modulates AQP3 to influence GC cell metastasis, making it a potential therapeutic target for GC."

        "# Title: Long non-coding RNA NKILA inhibits migration and invasion of tongue squamous cell carcinoma cells via suppressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition.\n# Abstract: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged recently as key regulators of tumor development and progression. Our previous study identified an NF-KappaB interacting lncRNA (NKILA) which was negatively correlated with breast cancer metastasis and patient prognosis. However, its clinical significance and potential role in Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) remain unclear. Here we show that NKILA is down-regulated in TSCC cancer tissues than that in matched adjacent noncancerous tissues. And low NKILA expression in TSCC is significantly correlated with tumor metastasis and poor patient prognosis. In vitro, overexpression of NKILA decreases TSCC cells migration and invasion. Mechanistic study shows that NKILA inhibits the phosphorylation of IκBα and NF-κB activation as well as the induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Ectopic expression of NKILA in Tscca cells inhibits NF-κB activator TNF-α-promoted cell migration and invasion, while applying NF-κB inhibitor Bay-117082 or JSH-23 in NKILA silenced CAL27 cells reverses cell migration capacity to lower level. In vivo experimental metastasis model also demonstrates NKILA inhibits lung metastasis of NOD/SCID mice with TSCC tumors. These results suggested that NKILA is a vital determinant of TSCC migration and invasion and NF-κB signaling pathway mediates this effect. Given the above mentioned function of NKILA, it could act as a potential predictor for overall survival in patients with TSCC and a potential therapeutic target for TSCC intervention.",

However, the clinical significance and biological roles of NKILA in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remain unknown. In this study, we showed that NKILA was downregulated in ESCC tissues and cancer cells compared with their normal counterparts. Low NKILA expression correlated with large tumor size and advanced TNM stage, and predicted poor overall and disease-free survival of ESCC patients. Further loss- and gain-of-function assays indicated that NKILA inhibited proliferation and migration of ESCC cells in vitro, suppressed tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, NKILA could inhibit phosphorylation of IκBα, suppress p65 nuclear translocation and downregulate the expression of NF-κB target genes in ESCC cells. These results suggest NKILA could suppress malignant development of ESCC via abrogation of the NF-κB signaling and may potentially serve as a prognostic marker for ESCC.",

Baicalein, a principle flavonoid, has shown attractive anti-cancer effects on HCC. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and influencing factors contributing to the anti-cancer effects of baicalein on HCC are still largely unknown. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been revealed to be fascinating therapeutic targets for cancers. The roles of NF-κB Interacting LncRNA (NKILA) are recently explored in several cancers. However, the expressions, clinical significances, roles and action mechanisms of NKILA in the anti-cancer effects of baicalein on HCC are unknown. In this study, we found that NKILA is down-regulated in HCC and reduced expression of NKILA indicts poor survival of HCC patients. Functional assays showed that overexpression of NKILA enhances the roles of baicalein on HCC cell proliferation inhibition, apoptosis induction, and migration inhibition in vitro and tumor growth suppression in vivo. Conversely, knockdown of NKILA suppresses the effects of baicalein. Mechanistically, we found that NKILA inhibits IκBα phosphorylation, NF-κB nuclear translocation, and NF-κB activity. NKILA also enhances the inhibitory effects of baicalein on NF-κB signaling. Furthermore, the effects of NKILA on baicalein-induced NF-κB activity inhibition, cell growth inhibition, apoptosis induction, and migration inhibition are reversed by NF-κB nuclear translocation inhibitor JSH-23. Collectively, our data demonstrated that NKILA enhances the anti-cancer effects of baicalein on HCC in vitro and in vivo via the regulation of NF-κB signaling, and implied that the combination of NKILA and baicalein would be potential therapeutic strategies for HCC.",

NF-κB interacting lncRNA (NKILA) has been reported to serve as a tumor suppressor in several cancers through combining with NF-κB: IκB complex thereby inhibiting NF-κB activation. Herein, we demonstrated a low NKILA expression in laryngeal cancer and its correlation with shorter overall survival in patients with laryngeal cancer. NKILA serves as a tumor suppressor in laryngeal cancer by suppressing laryngeal cancer cell viability and migration, whereas promoting cell apoptosis; NKILA knockdown reverses the cytotoxicity of X-ray radiation on laryngeal cancer cells through combining with NF-κB: IκB complex to inhibit IκB phosphorylation, inhibit p65 nuclear translocation, and finally inhibit NF-κB activation. NF-κB binds to the promoter region of NKILA to activate its transcriptional activity, upregulated NKILA then inhibits IκB phosphorylation and NF-κB activation, thus forming a negative feedback loop to sensitize laryngeal cancer cell to X-ray radiation. In conclusion, NKILA can serve as a promising agent of enhancing the cytotoxicity of X-ray radiation on laryngeal cancer and addressing the radioresistance of laryngeal cancer.",

The association between NKILA expression and clinical variables including prognosis was estimated in rectal cancer patients. The gain-of-function study of NKILA in rectal cancer cell was conducted to evaluate the effect of NKILA on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and NF-κB signaling pathway. The results suggested NKILA expression was decreased in rectal cancer tissues and cells, and correlated with clinical stage, T classification, N classification and M classification. NKILA low-expression was an independent poor prognostic factor in rectal cancer patients. NKILA-inhibited rectal cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via suppressing NF-κB signaling.

The prognosis of patients with CRC at an advanced stage is poor. Biomarkers currently used in clinical practice, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen (CA) 19-9, lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity for early diagnosis and prediction, therefore there remains a requirement to improve the prognosis of patients with CRC. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been revealed to serve fundamental roles in various pathophysiological processes, including cancer initiation and progression. The present study investigated the expression and clinical significance of the lncRNA nuclear factor-κB interacting long non-coding RNA (NKILA) in CRC. It was identified that NKILA was downregulated in six CRC cell lines and tissues (n=173). Low NKILA expression was significantly associated with a poor differentiation grade, larger tumor size and advanced Tumor-Node-Metastases stages. Further statistical analyses revealed that low NKILA expression predicted poor overall survival (OS) rate and progression-free survival (PFS) rate. In addition, low NKILA expression was determined as an independent risk factor for poor OS and PFS. Furthermore, NKILA exhibited a relatively high sensitivity and specificity compared with CEA and CA19-9 in the early diagnosis of CRC. The serum level of NKILA was positively correlated with the level in tissues. In addition, a decreased NKILA level in serum was revealed to be partially restored post-operatively. In conclusion, low NKILA expression has been demonstrated to accelerate CRC progression and NKILA may be a potential novel biomarker in early diagnosis and prognosis of patients with CRC.",

Accumulating evidence has shown that both long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and NF-κB play vital roles in the regulation of cancer metastasis. However, the clinical significance and biological function of NKILA (NF-κB interacting lncRNA) and its interaction with NF-κB in HCC remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that NKILA was down-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines, and decreased NKILA expression was significantly associated with larger tumor size and positive vascular invasion in HCC patients. NKILA reduction was an independent risk factor of HCC patients' poor prognosis, and the 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of patients with low and high NKILA expression were 15.6% and 60.0%, respectively. Moreover, NKILA inhibits migration and invasion of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, NKILA prevents Slug/epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway via suppressing phosphorylation of IκBα, p65 nuclear translocation and NF-κB activation. In conclusion, these results indicate that NKILA might serve as an effective prognostic biomarker and a promising therapeutic target against HCC metastasis."

Positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]FDDNP and the determination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of these proteins constitute a means to visualize in vivo Aβ and tau brain accumulation. Information about longitudinal changes of these CSF and PET biomarkers in PD with regard to progression to dementia is lacking. We assessed the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of CSF and PET biomarkers of tau and Aβ with PD-related cognitive dysfunction in 6 healthy-controls (HC), 16 patients with PD without dementia (PDND), and 8 PD with dementia (PDD). All subjects underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing, [18F]FDDNP PET, and CSF Aβ-tau determination. After 18 months, the PDND group was re-assessed clinically and by neuropsychological, PET, and CSF determinations. Cross-sectionally, PDD had higher [18F]FDDNP binding in lateral temporal regions and lower levels of CSF Aβ levels compared to PDND, with a congruent correlation between the [18F]FDDNP binding and CSF Aβ levels. Longitudinally, higher baseline lateral temporal [18F]FDDNP binding was associated to longitudinal worsening in cognitive performances and progression to dementia among subjects classified as PDND at baseline, who additionally disclosed at follow-up an increase in lateral-temporal FDDNP binding, as well as a reduction in CSF Aβ and an increase in CSF tau levels.

        "# Title: Positron emission tomography imaging of tau pathology in progressive supranuclear palsy.\n# Abstract: Progressive supranuclear palsy is a rare form of atypical Parkinsonism that differs neuropathologically from other parkinsonian disorders. While many parkinsonian disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia, and multiple system atrophy are classified as synucleinopathies, progressive supranuclear palsy is coined a tauopathy due to the aggregation of pathological tau in the brain. [18F]AV-1451 (also known as [18F]-T807) is a positron emission tomography radiotracer that binds to paired helical filaments of tau in Alzheimer's disease. We investigated whether [18F]AV-1451 could be used as biomarker for the diagnosis and disease progression monitoring in progressive supranuclear palsy. Six progressive supranuclear palsy, six Parkinson's disease, and 10 age-matched healthy controls were recruited. An anatomical MRI and a 90-min PET scan, using [18F]AV-1451, were acquired from all participants.

No significant differences in standardized uptake value ratios were detected in our progressive supranuclear palsy group compared to the two control groups.

[18F]AV-1451 is a positron emission tomography radiotracer designed to bind pathological tau. A post-mortem study using [18F]AV-1451 discovered off-target binding properties to neuromelanin in the substantia nigra. A subsequent clinical study reported a 30% decrease in [18F]AV-1451 binding in the midbrain of PD patients. A total of 12 patients and 10 healthy age-matched controls were recruited. An anatomical MRI and a 90-min PET scan, using [18F]AV-1451, were acquired from all participants. The standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) from 60 to 90 min post-injection was calculated for the substantia nigra, using the cerebellar cortex as the reference region. The substantia nigra was delineated using automated region of interest software. An independent samples ANOVA and LSD post hoc testing were used to test for differences in [18F]AV-1451 SUVR between groups. Substantia nigra SUVR from 60 to 90 min was significantly greater in HC compared to both PSP and PD groups. Although the PD group had the lowest SUVR, there was no significant difference in substantia nigra uptake between PD and PSP. [18F]AV-1451 may be the first PET radiotracer capable of imaging neurodegeneration of the substantia nigra in parkinsonisms. Further testing must be done in PD and atypical parkinsonian disorders to support this off-target use of [18F]AV-1451.",

        "# Title: 18F-AV-1451 in Parkinson's Disease with and without dementia and in Dementia with Lewy Bodies.\n# Abstract: Mixed pathologies of α-synuclein, β-amyloid and tau are relatively common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). We therefore wanted to study the retention patterns of 18F-AV-1451 in PD, PD-dementia (PDD), and DLB. To do this 44 healthy controls, 11 non-demented patients with PD, 18 patients with PDD, and six patients with DLB underwent MRI and 18F-AV-1451 PET scanning and cognitive testing. We found that parietal 18F-AV-1451 retention was increased in patients with DLB compared to controls and PD patients, while 18F-AV-1451 uptake was reduced in the substantia nigra in PDD. Increased parietal 18F-AV-1451 PET uptake was associated with impaired performance on verbal fluency tests, and the decreased uptake in the substantia nigra correlated with worse motor function. We found no effect of the monoamine oxidase B inhibitor rasagiline on 18F-AV-1451 binding. In conclusion DLB patients have increased parietal 18F-AV-1451 uptake. Increased parietal tau is associated with executive impairment in patients with synucleinopathies, while decreased uptake in the substantia nigra is associated with parkinsonism. Further, our data indicate that 18F-AV-1451 does not significantly bind to MAO-B in vivo.",

        "# Title: PET Imaging of Astrogliosis and Tau Facilitates Diagnosis of Parkinsonian Syndromes.\n# Abstract: Neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes comprise a number of disorders that are characterized by similar clinical features but are separated on the basis of different pathologies, i.e., aggregates of α-synuclein or tau protein. Due to the overlap of signs and symptoms a precise differentiation is often difficult, especially early in the disease course. Enormous efforts have been taken to develop tau-selective PET imaging agents, but strong off-target binding to monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) has been observed across first generation ligands. Nonetheless, astrogliosis-related MAO-B elevation is a common histopathological known feature of all parkinsonian syndromes and might be itself an interesting imaging target. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the performance of [18F]-THK5351, a combined MAO-B and tau tracer for differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes. [18F]-THK5351 PET was performed in 34 patients: six with Parkinson's disease (PD), nine with multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P), six with MSA with predominant cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C), and 13 with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) Richardson's syndrome. Volume-of-interest-based quantification of standardized-uptake-values was conducted in different parkinsonian syndrome-related target regions. PET results were subjected to multinomial logistic regression to create a prediction model discriminating among groups. Furthermore, we correlated tracer uptake with clinical findings. Elevated [18F]-THK5351 uptake in midbrain and diencephalon differentiated PSP patients from PD and MSA-C. MSA-C patients were distinguishable by high tracer uptake in the pons and cerebellar deep white matter when compared to PSP and PD patients, whereas MSA-P patients tended to show higher tracer uptake in the lentiform nucleus. A multinomial logistic regression classified 33/34 patients into the correct clinical diagnosis group. Tracer uptake in the pons, cerebellar deep white matter, and striatum was closely associated with the presence of cerebellar and parkinsonian symptoms of MSA patients. The current study demonstrates that combined MAO-B and tau binding of THK5351 facilitates differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes. Furthermore, our data indicate a correlation of MSA phenotype with [18F]-THK5351 uptake in certain brain regions, illustrating their relevance for the emergence of clinical symptoms and underlining the potential of THK5351 PET as a biomarker that correlates with pathological changes as well as with disease stage.",

We aimed to investigate its performance in combination with plasma tau levels in patients with non-AD tauopathy. Methods: A total of 47 participants were enrolled, including 10 healthy controls, 16 with tauopathy parkinsonism syndromes (9 with corticobasal syndrome [CBS], 7 with progressive supranuclear palsy [PSP]), 9 with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 4 with AD, and 8 with Parkinson's disease (PD). All participants underwent clinical assessments, 18F-T807 tau PET, brain MRI, and plasma tau assay. Results: The global cortical standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) of 18F-T807 PET was comparable between PD and control (p = 0.088). The cortical SUVR was significantly higher in AD group (p = 0.002) but was modestly increased in PSP group compared to the PD group (p = 0.044), especially in parietal and pallidal regions. Asymmetric 18F-T807 uptake at the pallidum was noted in patients with CBS and FTD. Cortical tau tracer uptake was associated with increased plasma total tau level (p = 0.016), especially in frontal and parietal regions. Regional tracer uptake was correlated with cortical thinning in patients with CBS and PSP (CBS: r = -0.092, p = 0.025; PSP: r = -0.114, p = 0.015). Conclusions: The 18F-T807 tau tracer uptake was only modestly increased in patients with PSP. Although the cortical tau tracer uptake correlated with regional cortical atrophy and plasma tau levels, a four-repeated tau-specific tracer is needed for future classifying tauopathy parkinsonism syndromes.",

This single-center study was conducted to assess the accuracy of SWE in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), in comparison with transient elastography (TE), by using liver biopsy (LB) as the reference standard. Consecutive patients with CHC scheduled for LB by referring physicians were studied. One hundred and twenty-one patients met inclusion criteria. On the same day, real-time SWE using the ultrasound (US) system, Aixplorer (SuperSonic Imagine S.A., Aix-en-Provence, France), TE using FibroScan (Echosens, Paris, France), and US-assisted LB were consecutively performed. Fibrosis was staged according to the METAVIR scoring system. Analyses of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were performed to calculate optimal area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for F0-F1 versus F2-F4, F0- F2 versus F3-F4, and F0-F3 versus F4 for both real-time SWE and TE. Liver stiffness values increased in parallel with degree of liver fibrosis, both with SWE and TE. AUROCs were 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-0.96) for SWE and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.76-0.90) for TE (P = 0.002), 0.98 (95% CI: 0.94-1.00) for SWE and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.90-0.99) for TE (P = 0.14), and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.93-1.00) for SWE and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.91-0.99) for TE (P = 0.48), when comparing F0-F1 versus F2- F4, F0- F2 versus F3-F4, and F0 -F3 versus F4, respectively.",

A total of 1440 measurements were made. Reproducibility was assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and a repeated measures analysis of variance. The shear wave speed was measured and used to estimate Young's modulus using the Supersonics Imagine Aixplorer. The median Young's modulus measured through the inter-costal space was 5.55 ± 0.74 kPa. The intra-operator reliability was better for same-day evaluations (ICC = 0.91) than the inter-operator reliability (ICC = 0.78). Intra-observer agreement decreased when scans were repeated on a different day. Inter-session repeatability was between 3.3% and 9.9% for intra-day repeated scans, compared with to 6.5%-12% for inter-day repeated scans. No significant difference was observed in subjects with a body mass index greater or less than 25 kg/m(2).",

With this index, the intra-observer acquisition variability assessed by comparing consecutive scans of the same patient was 17% and 32% for HG and LG clips, respectively. The measurement quantification variability assessed by comparing the measurements of a radiologist with those of a trained operator and of two automatic measurements on a same clip averaged 13% and 22% for HG and LG exams, respectively.

The rate of reliable liver stiffness measurements was significantly higher with 2-D SWE than with TE: 99.2% versus 74.8%, p < 0.0001 (different reliability criteria used, according to current recommendations). In univariate analysis, liver stiffness measured with 2-D SWE correlated best with fibrosis stage estimated with TE (r = 0.699, p < 0.0001), followed by Forns score (r = 0.534, p < 0.0001) and King's score (r = 0.512, p < 0.0001). However, in multivariate analysis, only 2-D SWE-measured values remained correlated with fibrosis stage (p < 0.0001). The optimal 2-D SWE cutoff values for predicting significant fibrosis were 8.03 kPa for fibrosis stage ≥2 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.832) and 13.1 kPa for fibrosis stage 4 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.915), respectively.

        "# Title: Assessment of liver fibrosis with 2-D shear wave elastography in comparison to transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse imaging in patients with chronic liver disease.\n# Abstract: Two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2-D SWE) is an ultrasound-based elastography method integrated into a conventional ultrasound machine. It can evaluate larger regions of interest and, therefore, might be better at determining the overall fibrosis distribution. The aim of this prospective study was to compare 2-D SWE with the two best evaluated liver elastography methods, transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse (point SWE using acoustic radiation force impulse) imaging, in the same population group. The study included 132 patients with chronic hepatopathies, in which liver stiffness was evaluated using transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging and 2-D SWE. The reference methods were liver biopsy for the assessment of liver fibrosis (n = 101) and magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography for the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis (n = 31). No significant difference in diagnostic accuracy, assessed as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), was found between the three elastography methods (2-D SWE, transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging) for the diagnosis of significant and advanced fibrosis and liver cirrhosis in the \"per protocol\" (AUROCs for fibrosis stages ≥2: 0.90, 0.95 and 0.91; for fibrosis stage [F] ≥3: 0.93, 0.95 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.92, 0.96 and 0.92) and \"intention to diagnose\" cohort (AUROCs for F ≥2: 0.87, 0.92 and 0.91; for F ≥3: 0.91, 0.93 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.88, 0.90 and 0.89).

The goal of this study was to assess the clinical use of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) evaluated by supersonic shear imaging (SSI), FibroScan, and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) in a cohort of NAFLD patients who underwent liver biopsy. A total of 291 NAFLD patients were prospectively enrolled from November 2011 to February 2015 at 2 French university hospitals. LSM was assessed by SSI, FibroScan (M probe), and ARFI within two weeks prior to liver biopsy. Calculations of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) were performed and compared for the staging of liver fibrosis. AUROC for SSI, FibroScan, and ARFI were 0.86, 0.82, and 0.77 for diagnoses of ≥F2; 0.89, 0.86, and 0.84 for ≥F3; and 0.88, 0.87, and 0.84 for F4, respectively. SSI had a higher accuracy than ARFI for diagnoses of significant fibrosis (≥F2) (P = 0.004). Clinical factors related to obesity such as body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2) , waist circumference ≥102 cm or increased parietal wall thickness were associated with LSM failures when using SSI or FibroScan and with unreliable results when using ARFI. In univariate analysis, FibroScan values were slightly correlated with NAFLD activity score and steatosis (R = 0.28 and 0.22, respectively), whereas SSI and ARFI were not; however, these components of NAFLD did not affect LSM results in multivariate analysis. The cutoff values for SSI and FibroScan for staging fibrosis with a sensitivity ≥90% were very close: 6.3/6.2 kPa for ≥F2, 8.3/8.2 kPa for ≥F3, and 10.5/9.5 kPa for F4.",

The purpose of this study was to perform an intra-individual comparison between 2-D shear wave elastography (2-D-SWE with a GE system) and Virtual Touch Tissue Quantification (VTTQ with a Siemens system) to assess whether these can be used interchangeably to grade fibrosis. Ninety-three patients (51 men, 42 women; mean age, 54 y) with liver disease of various etiologies (hepatitis B virus = 47, hepatitis C virus = 22; alcohol = 6, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis = 5, other = 13) were included. Using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values, liver fibrosis was classified into clinically non-significant (F0/F1) and significant (≥F2) fibrosis. Results indicated that intra-modality repeatability was excellent for both techniques (GE 2-D-SWE: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.89 [0.84-0.93]; VTTQ: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.90 [0.86-0.93]). Intra-modality classification agreement for fibrosis grading was good to excellent (GE 2-D-SWE: κ = 0.65, VTTQ: κ = 0.82). However, inter-modality agreement for fibrosis grading was only fair (κ = 0.31) using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values of fibrosis. In conclusion, although both GE 2-D-SWE and Siemens VTTQ exhibit good to excellent intra-modality repeatability, inter-modality agreement is only fair, suggesting that these should not be used interchangeably.",

        "# Title: Long-term CD4+ T-cell response to highly active antiretroviral therapy according to baseline CD4+ T-cell count.\n# Abstract: Current treatment guidelines for HIV infection recommend a relatively late initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Nevertheless, there is still a concern that immune recovery may not be as complete once CD4+ T cells have decreased below a certain threshold. This study addressed the long-term response of CD4+ T-cell counts in patients on HAART and analyzed the influence of baseline CD4+ T-cell counts, baseline viral load, and age. An observational analysis of evolution of CD4+ T cells in 861 antiretroviral therapy-naive chronic HIV-1-infected patients who started treatment consisting of at least 3 drugs in or after 1996 was performed. Patients were classified in 4 groups according to baseline CD4+ T cells: <200 cells/mm3, 200-349 cells/mm3, 350-499 cells/mm3, and >or=500 cells/mm3. The main outcome measures were proportion of patients with CD4+ T cells <200/mm3 and >500/mm3 at last determination and rate of CD4+ T-cell recovery. Patients were followed-up for a median of 173 weeks (interquartile range [IQR], 100-234). There were no differences in follow-up between the 4 groups. CD4+ T cells increased in the whole cohort from a median of 214 cells/mm3 (IQR, 90-355) to 499 cells/mm3 (IQR, 312-733) (P<0.001). Compared with the group with a baseline CD4+ T-cell count of >or=500/mm3, the relative risk of having a last determination of CD4+ T-cell counts >200 cells/mm3 was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.75-0.83), 0.92 (95% CI, 0.89-0.96) and 1 for baseline CD4+ T cells <200 cells/mm3, 200-349 cells/mm3, and 350-499 cells/mm3, respectively. The relative risk of having a last determination of CD4+ T-cell counts >500 cells/mm3 was 0.32 (95% CI, 0.27-0.39, P<0.001), 0.69 (95% CI, 0.60-0.79, P<0.001), and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.83-1.06, P=0.38) for baseline CD4+ T-cell counts <200 cells/mm3, 200-349 cells/mm3, and 350-0499 cells/mm3, respectively, compared with a baseline CD4+ T-cell count of >or=500 cells/mm3. The increase in CD4+ T cells from baseline was statistically significant and was maintained for up to 4 years of follow-up. This increase seemed to slow down after approximately 3 years and reached a plateau after 4-5 years of follow-up even in patients who achieved and maintained viral suppression in plasma. Long-term immune recovery is possible regardless of baseline CD4+ T-cell count. However, patients who start therapy with a CD4+ T-cell count <200 cells/mm3 have poorer immunologic outcome as measured by the proportion of patients with CD4+ T cells <200/mm3 or >500/mm3 at last determination. It seems that the immune recovery slows down after approximately 3 years of HAART and reaches a plateau after 4-5 years of HAART.",

        "# Title: Standard assessments of frailty are validated predictors of mortality in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis.\n# Abstract: The risk of morbidity and mortality for hospitalized patients with cirrhosis is high and incompletely captured by conventional indices. We sought to evaluate the predictive role of frailty in an observational cohort study of inpatients with decompensated cirrhosis between 2010 and 2013. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included discharge to a rehabilitation hospital, 30-day readmission, and length of stay. Frailty was assessed with three metrics: activities of daily living (ADL), the Braden Scale, and the Morse fall risk score. A predictive model was validated by randomly dividing the population into training and validation cohorts: 734 patients were admitted 1358 times in the study period. The overall 90-day mortality was 18.3%. The 30-day readmission rate was 26.6%, and the rate of discharge to a rehabilitation facility was 14.3%. Adjusting for sex, age, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, sodium, and Charlson index, the odds ratio for the effect of an ADL score of less than 12 of 15 on mortality is 1.83 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-3.20). A predictive model for 90-day mortality including ADL and Braden Scale yielded C statistics of 0.83 (95% CI 0.80-0.86) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.71-0.83) in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Discharge to a rehabilitation hospital is predicted by both the ADL (<12) and Braden Scale (<16), with respective adjusted odds ratios of 3.78 (95% CI 1.97-7.29) and 6.23 (95% CI 2.53-15.4).

However, for patients with compensated disease, data are limited regarding associations with poor patient-reported outcomes (PROs). We prospectively enrolled 300 patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension without a history of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and reviewed medical and pharmacy records. We characterized determinants of PROs using the 8-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-8) scale (0-100) and sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; poor sleep >5). Disability and frailty measures were assessed using activities of daily living (ADLs), falls, hand-grip, and chair-stands. Cognitive function was measured using weighted-lures from the Inhibitory Control Test (ICT). The median age of our cohort was 60 (interquartile range [IQR], 52-66) years, 56.3% were male, and 70% Child class A. All patients had portal hypertension, 76% had varices, and 41% had a history of ascites (predominantly well controlled). The median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease with Sodium (MELD-Na) score was 9 (IQR, 7-13). The overall median SF-8 was 70 (IQR, 54-86). Multivariate analysis showed that after adjusting for age, sex, education, and MELD-Na, performance on chair-stands (9.28 HRQOL points [95% confidence interval {CI}, 4.76-13.8] per 10-stands), ADL dependence (-6.06 [-10.8 to -1.36]), opiate use (-5.01 [-7.84 to -2.19]), benzodiazepine use (-3.50 [-6.58 to -0.42]), and ICT performance (-0.10 [-0.20 to 0.001] per weighted-lure) were significantly associated with HRQOL. Among patients completing the ICT, poor HRQOL (score <50) was significantly associated with chair-stands (odds ratio [OR] per 10-stands, 0.24; 95% CI [0.11-0.56]) and weighted lures (OR per weighted-lure, 1.01 [1.00-1.03]). Poor sleep quality was associated with opiate use (OR, 2.85 [1.11-7.29]) and lures (OR per-lure, 1.03 [1.00-1.05]).

        "# Title: Frailty Is a Risk Factor for Postoperative Mortality in Patients With Cirrhosis Undergoing Diverse Major Surgeries.\n# Abstract: With a rising burden of cirrhosis surgeries, understanding risk factors for postoperative mortality is more salient than ever. The role of baseline frailty has not been assessed in this context. We evaluated the association between patient frailty and postoperative risk among diverse patients with cirrhosis and determined if frailty improves prognostication of cirrhosis surgical risk scores. This was a retrospective cohort study of U.S. veterans with cirrhosis identified between 2008 and 2016 who underwent nontransplant major surgery. Frailty was ascertained using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS). Cox regression analysis was used to investigate the impact of patient frailty on postoperative mortality. Logistic regression was used to identify incremental changes in discrimination for postoperative mortality when frailty was added to the risk prediction models, including the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), MELD-sodium (MELD-Na), Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP), Mayo Risk Score (MRS), and Veterans Outcomes and Costs Associated With Liver Disease (VOCAL)-Penn. A total of 804 cirrhosis surgeries were identified. The majority of patients (48.5%) had high-risk frailty at baseline (HFRS >15). In adjusted Cox regression models, categories of increasing frailty scores were associated with poorer postoperative survival. For example, intermediate-risk frailty (HFRS 5-15) conferred a 1.77-fold increased hazard relative to low-risk frailty (HFRS, <5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-2.95; P = 0.03). High-risk frailty demonstrated a similarly increased hazard (hazard ratio, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.05-2.88; P = 0.03), suggesting a threshold effect of frailty on postoperative mortality. The incorporation of frailty improved discrimination of MELD, MELD-Na, and CTP for postoperative mortality, but did not do so for the MRS or VOCAL-Penn score. Patient frailty was an additional important predictor of cirrhosis surgical risk. The incorporation of preoperative frailty assessments may help to risk stratify patients, especially in settings where the MELD-Na and CTP are commonly applied.",

We examined the feasibility of inpatient frailty measurements and associations with nonhome discharge, readmission, and all-cause mortality among patients admitted for cirrhosis complications. We conducted a prospective study at 3 liver transplantation (LT) centers. Frailty was assessed using the liver frailty index (LFI). Multivariable logistic and competing risk models evaluated associations between frailty and clinical outcomes. We included 211 patients with median MELD-Na score 21 (interquartile range [IQR],15-27); 96 (45%) were women, and 102 (48%) were on the LT waiting list. At a median follow-up of 8.3 months, 29 patients (14%) were nonhome discharged, 144 (68%) were readmitted, 70 (33%) underwent LT, and 44 (21%) died. A total of 124 patients (59%) were frail, with a median LFI of 4.71 (IQR, 4.07-5.54). Frail patients were older (mean, 59 versus 54 years) and more likely to have chronic kidney disease (40% versus 20%; P = 0.002) and coronary artery disease (17% versus 7%; P = 0.03). Frailty was associated with hospital-acquired infections (8% versus 1%; P = 0.02). In multivariable models, LFI was associated with nonhome discharge (odds ratio, 1.81 per 1-point increase; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-2.86). Frailty (LFI≥4.5) was associated with all-cause mortality in models accounting for LT as competing risk (subhazard ratio [sHR], 2.4; 95% CI, 1.13-5.11); results were similar with LFI as a continuous variable (sHR, 1.62 per 1-point increase; 95% CI, 1.15-2.28).

In this cohort of 227 patients with mean age of 61.7 years and 47.2% male, more than half of the study population represented impairment in HRQoL in at least one domain, according to EQ-5D. Furthermore, sleep disturbance and frailty have proved to be independently associated with poor HRQoL in two separate regression models, whereas conventional scoring systems such as Child-Pugh classification and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease are not closely relevant. Intriguingly, not all health domains within EQ-5D correlated well with PSQI and Frailty Index, with the exception of usual activities. Pain and anxiety/depression were the most frequently affected HRQoL domains even in patients without sleep disturbance or frailty. Conclusion: Impaired HRQoL is prevalent in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Sleep disturbance and frailty are independently associated with poor HRQoL. It is imperative to timely intervene with these symptoms and deliver tailored health care.",

        "# Title: Liver Frailty Index for Prediction of Short-Term Rehospitalization in Patients with Liver Cirrhosis.\n# Abstract: Background: Stratifying patients with liver cirrhosis for risk of rehospitalization is challenging with established scoring systems for chronic liver disease. Frailty captures the physical characteristics of patients with cirrhosis. Its value for predicting short-term rehospitalizations in hospitalized patients remains to be defined. Methods: Eighty-three non-electively hospitalized patients with liver cirrhosis were analyzed in this study. Frailty was assessed during the last 48 h of hospital stay with the liver frailty index (LFI). Patients were followed for 30-day rehospitalization. Results: In total, 26 (31%) patients were rehospitalized within 30 days. The median LFI was 4.5, and 43 (52%) patients were identified as frail. Rehospitalized patients had a significant higher LFI compared to patients without a rehospitalization within 30 days. In multivariable analysis, LFI as a metric variable (OR 2.36, p = 0.02) and lower platelet count (OR 0.98, p < 0.01) were independently associated with rehospitalization. LFI and its subtest chair stands had the best discriminative ability to predict rehospitalization, with AUROCs of 0.66 and 0.67, respectively. An LFI cut-off of >4.62 discriminated best between patients with and without elevated risk for rehospitalization within 30 days. Conclusions: Measures of frailty could be useful to identify patients at higher risk for short-term rehospitalization.",

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a cross-sectional study involving individuals aged 32 to 69 years, all diagnosed with liver cirrhosis. The chronic liver disease questionnaire (CLDQ) was used to assess HR-QoL, the CLDQ score was used as an outcome to measure the factors related to HR-QoL, and the liver frailty index (LFI) was used to assess the frailty status. The association between the frailty status and the CLDQ summary scales was investigated using the correlation coefficient and multiple regression analyses. A total of 138 patients in the frail (n = 62) and non-frail (n = 76) groups with (alcohol: 97; viral: 24; autoimmune: 17; and cryptogenic: 12) were included in the study.

The current study analyzed the clinical significance of this new stage in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Subjects and Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 4045 eligible PTC patients. The patients were divided into four groups according to the extent of ETE: no ETE, ETE into perithyroidal tissue, T3b (ETE into the strap muscles), and ETE beyond the strap muscles. Differences in the clinical characteristics and prognosis of the four groups were assessed. Results: Of these 4045 patients, 2300 (56.9%) had no ETE, 1004 (24.8%) had ETE into perithyroidal tissue, 371 (9.2%) had ETE into the strap muscles, and 370 (9.1%) had ETE beyond the strap muscles. Tumor size, multifocality, lymph node metastasis (LNM), distant metastasis (DM), recurrence, and recurrence-free survival (RFS) between patients with ETE into perithyroidal tissue and patients without ETE did not show differences, but significant differences were observed between patients with T3b and patients without ETE, and only patients with ETE beyond the strap muscles had significantly worse overall survival (OS) than the other three groups. However, T3b did not independently predict worse RFS in univariable and multivariable analyses. Conclusions: T3b, distinguished from minimal ETE, may be related to larger tumor size, higher prevalence of multifocality, LNM, DM, recurrence, and worse RFS than no ETE, but it may not affect OS and may not independently predict recurrence in PTC patients.",
        "# Title: Is There a Difference Between Minimal and Gross Extension into the Strap Muscles for the Risk of Recurrence in Papillary Thyroid Carcinomas?\n# Abstract: Background: The morbidity of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is primarily related to locoregional recurrences and distant metastases. The definition of minimal extrathyroidal extension (mETE) has been recently revised. The presence of mETE does not impact mortality and is generally not considered to be a predictor for the risk of recurrence. This study aimed at comparing the risk of recurrence and the response to therapy of PTC with mETE and gross extrathyroidal extension (ETE) into the strap muscles (gETE) with low- and intermediate-risk PTC without ETE (low risk w/o ETE and intermediate risk w/o ETE, respectively) to further characterize the impact of ETE on outcomes. Methods: A total of 596 PTCs were analyzed according to the degree of ETE as well as other predictors of recurrence. Four groups of patients were compared, low risk w/o ETE (n = 251), intermediate risk w/o ETE (n = 89), mETE (n = 191), and gETE (n = 65), to determine the risk of recurrence and the response to treatment. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate associations between groups and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: The risk of recurrence was 3% in low risk w/o ETE PTC, 14% in intermediate risk w/o ETE, 14% in mETE, and 25% in gETE. The recurrence risk was increased by the presence of ETE (odds ratio [OR] = 2.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-5.85, p = 0.005) and lymph node metastases (OR = 2.44 [95% CI 1.25-4.76], p = 0.009). Patients with low-risk carcinomas w/o ETE experienced longer DFS than those with mETE (hazard ratio = 0.08 [95% CI 0.02-0.28], p < 0.001), but no significant difference was observed between intermediate risk w/o ETE, mETE, and gETE. In terms of the response to therapy, patients with gETE had higher rates of biochemical and/or structural incomplete responses within the first year of treatment (OR = 2.68 [95% CI 1.31-5.45], p = 0.007) and at the final follow-up evaluation (OR = 4.35 [95% CI 1.99-9.51], p < 0.001) compared with those with mETE. An analysis of the subgroups of microcarcinomas without lymph node metastases revealed no significant difference in DFS or the response to therapy between the low risk w/o ETE and mETE PTC groups. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that both mETE and gETE are independent risk factors for the risk of recurrence in PTC. Although gETE has a more pronounced impact on the recurrence risk and is associated with a worse response to therapy, mETE may not be associated with a low risk of recurrence. This observation suggests that patients with PTC and mETE may, in part, have an intermediate risk of recurrence and need to be followed accordingly."

Positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]FDDNP and the determination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of these proteins constitute a means to visualize in vivo Aβ and tau brain accumulation. Information about longitudinal changes of these CSF and PET biomarkers in PD with regard to progression to dementia is lacking. We assessed the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of CSF and PET biomarkers of tau and Aβ with PD-related cognitive dysfunction in 6 healthy-controls (HC), 16 patients with PD without dementia (PDND), and 8 PD with dementia (PDD). All subjects underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing, [18F]FDDNP PET, and CSF Aβ-tau determination. After 18 months, the PDND group was re-assessed clinically and by neuropsychological, PET, and CSF determinations. Cross-sectionally, PDD had higher [18F]FDDNP binding in lateral temporal regions and lower levels of CSF Aβ levels compared to PDND, with a congruent correlation between the [18F]FDDNP binding and CSF Aβ levels. Longitudinally, higher baseline lateral temporal [18F]FDDNP binding was associated to longitudinal worsening in cognitive performances and progression to dementia among subjects classified as PDND at baseline, who additionally disclosed at follow-up an increase in lateral-temporal FDDNP binding, as well as a reduction in CSF Aβ and an increase in CSF tau levels.

While many parkinsonian disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia, and multiple system atrophy are classified as synucleinopathies, progressive supranuclear palsy is coined a tauopathy due to the aggregation of pathological tau in the brain. [18F]AV-1451 (also known as [18F]-T807) is a positron emission tomography radiotracer that binds to paired helical filaments of tau in Alzheimer's disease. We investigated whether [18F]AV-1451 could be used as biomarker for the diagnosis and disease progression monitoring in progressive supranuclear palsy. Six progressive supranuclear palsy, six Parkinson's disease, and 10 age-matched healthy controls were recruited. An anatomical MRI and a 90-min PET scan, using [18F]AV-1451, were acquired from all participants. The standardized uptake value ratio from 60 to 90 min post-injection was calculated in each region of interest, using the cerebellar cortex as a reference region. No significant differences in standardized uptake value ratios were detected in our progressive supranuclear palsy group compared to the two control groups.

[18F]AV-1451 is a positron emission tomography radiotracer designed to bind pathological tau. A post-mortem study using [18F]AV-1451 discovered off-target binding properties to neuromelanin in the substantia nigra. A subsequent clinical study reported a 30% decrease in [18F]AV-1451 binding in the midbrain of PD patients. A total of 12 patients and 10 healthy age-matched controls were recruited. An anatomical MRI and a 90-min PET scan, using [18F]AV-1451, were acquired from all participants. The standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) from 60 to 90 min post-injection was calculated for the substantia nigra, using the cerebellar cortex as the reference region. The substantia nigra was delineated using automated region of interest software. An independent samples ANOVA and LSD post hoc testing were used to test for differences in [18F]AV-1451 SUVR between groups. Substantia nigra SUVR from 60 to 90 min was significantly greater in HC compared to both PSP and PD groups. Although the PD group had the lowest SUVR, there was no significant difference in substantia nigra uptake between PD and PSP. [18F]AV-1451 may be the first PET radiotracer capable of imaging neurodegeneration of the substantia nigra in parkinsonisms.

We therefore wanted to study the retention patterns of 18F-AV-1451 in PD, PD-dementia (PDD), and DLB. To do this 44 healthy controls, 11 non-demented patients with PD, 18 patients with PDD, and six patients with DLB underwent MRI and 18F-AV-1451 PET scanning and cognitive testing. We found that parietal 18F-AV-1451 retention was increased in patients with DLB compared to controls and PD patients, while 18F-AV-1451 uptake was reduced in the substantia nigra in PDD. Increased parietal 18F-AV-1451 PET uptake was associated with impaired performance on verbal fluency tests, and the decreased uptake in the substantia nigra correlated with worse motor function. We found no effect of the monoamine oxidase B inhibitor rasagiline on 18F-AV-1451 binding. In conclusion DLB patients have increased parietal 18F-AV-1451 uptake. Increased parietal tau is associated with executive impairment in patients with synucleinopathies, while decreased uptake in the substantia nigra is associated with parkinsonism. Further, our data indicate that 18F-AV-1451 does not significantly bind to MAO-B in vivo.",

        "# Title: PET Imaging of Astrogliosis and Tau Facilitates Diagnosis of Parkinsonian Syndromes.\n# Abstract: Neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes comprise a number of disorders that are characterized by similar clinical features but are separated on the basis of different pathologies, i.e., aggregates of α-synuclein or tau protein. Due to the overlap of signs and symptoms a precise differentiation is often difficult, especially early in the disease course. Enormous efforts have been taken to develop tau-selective PET imaging agents, but strong off-target binding to monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) has been observed across first generation ligands. Nonetheless, astrogliosis-related MAO-B elevation is a common histopathological known feature of all parkinsonian syndromes and might be itself an interesting imaging target. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the performance of [18F]-THK5351, a combined MAO-B and tau tracer for differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes. [18F]-THK5351 PET was performed in 34 patients: six with Parkinson's disease (PD), nine with multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P), six with MSA with predominant cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C), and 13 with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) Richardson's syndrome. Volume-of-interest-based quantification of standardized-uptake-values was conducted in different parkinsonian syndrome-related target regions. PET results were subjected to multinomial logistic regression to create a prediction model discriminating among groups. Furthermore, we correlated tracer uptake with clinical findings. Elevated [18F]-THK5351 uptake in midbrain and diencephalon differentiated PSP patients from PD and MSA-C. MSA-C patients were distinguishable by high tracer uptake in the pons and cerebellar deep white matter when compared to PSP and PD patients, whereas MSA-P patients tended to show higher tracer uptake in the lentiform nucleus. A multinomial logistic regression classified 33/34 patients into the correct clinical diagnosis group. Tracer uptake in the pons, cerebellar deep white matter, and striatum was closely associated with the presence of cerebellar and parkinsonian symptoms of MSA patients. The current study demonstrates that combined MAO-B and tau binding of THK5351 facilitates differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes. Furthermore, our data indicate a correlation of MSA phenotype with [18F]-THK5351 uptake in certain brain regions, illustrating their relevance for the emergence of clinical symptoms and underlining the potential of THK5351 PET as a biomarker that correlates with pathological changes as well as with disease stage.",

We aimed to investigate its performance in combination with plasma tau levels in patients with non-AD tauopathy. Methods: A total of 47 participants were enrolled, including 10 healthy controls, 16 with tauopathy parkinsonism syndromes (9 with corticobasal syndrome [CBS], 7 with progressive supranuclear palsy [PSP]), 9 with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 4 with AD, and 8 with Parkinson's disease (PD). All participants underwent clinical assessments, 18F-T807 tau PET, brain MRI, and plasma tau assay. Results: The global cortical standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) of 18F-T807 PET was comparable between PD and control (p = 0.088). The cortical SUVR was significantly higher in AD group (p = 0.002) but was modestly increased in PSP group compared to the PD group (p = 0.044), especially in parietal and pallidal regions. Asymmetric 18F-T807 uptake at the pallidum was noted in patients with CBS and FTD. Cortical tau tracer uptake was associated with increased plasma total tau level (p = 0.016), especially in frontal and parietal regions. Regional tracer uptake was correlated with cortical thinning in patients with CBS and PSP (CBS: r = -0.092, p = 0.025; PSP: r = -0.114, p = 0.015). Conclusions: The 18F-T807 tau tracer uptake was only modestly increased in patients with PSP.

        "# Title: Implications of Extrathyroidal Extension Invading Only the Strap Muscles in Papillary Thyroid Carcinomas.\n# Abstract: Background: Based on the new TNM classification, differentiated thyroid carcinomas with extrathyroidal extension (ETE) into the strap muscles are designated as T3b. The current study analyzed the clinical significance of this new stage in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Subjects and Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 4045 eligible PTC patients. The patients were divided into four groups according to the extent of ETE: no ETE, ETE into perithyroidal tissue, T3b (ETE into the strap muscles), and ETE beyond the strap muscles. Differences in the clinical characteristics and prognosis of the four groups were assessed. Results: Of these 4045 patients, 2300 (56.9%) had no ETE, 1004 (24.8%) had ETE into perithyroidal tissue, 371 (9.2%) had ETE into the strap muscles, and 370 (9.1%) had ETE beyond the strap muscles. Tumor size, multifocality, lymph node metastasis (LNM), distant metastasis (DM), recurrence, and recurrence-free survival (RFS) between patients with ETE into perithyroidal tissue and patients without ETE did not show differences, but significant differences were observed between patients with T3b and patients without ETE, and only patients with ETE beyond the strap muscles had significantly worse overall survival (OS) than the other three groups. However, T3b did not independently predict worse RFS in univariable and multivariable analyses. Conclusions: T3b, distinguished from minimal ETE, may be related to larger tumor size, higher prevalence of multifocality, LNM, DM, recurrence, and worse RFS than no ETE, but it may not affect OS and may not independently predict recurrence in PTC patients.",
        "# Title: Is There a Difference Between Minimal and Gross Extension into the Strap Muscles for the Risk of Recurrence in Papillary Thyroid Carcinomas?\n# Abstract: Background: The morbidity of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is primarily related to locoregional recurrences and distant metastases. The definition of minimal extrathyroidal extension (mETE) has been recently revised. The presence of mETE does not impact mortality and is generally not considered to be a predictor for the risk of recurrence. This study aimed at comparing the risk of recurrence and the response to therapy of PTC with mETE and gross extrathyroidal extension (ETE) into the strap muscles (gETE) with low- and intermediate-risk PTC without ETE (low risk w/o ETE and intermediate risk w/o ETE, respectively) to further characterize the impact of ETE on outcomes. Methods: A total of 596 PTCs were analyzed according to the degree of ETE as well as other predictors of recurrence. Four groups of patients were compared, low risk w/o ETE (n = 251), intermediate risk w/o ETE (n = 89), mETE (n = 191), and gETE (n = 65), to determine the risk of recurrence and the response to treatment. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate associations between groups and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: The risk of recurrence was 3% in low risk w/o ETE PTC, 14% in intermediate risk w/o ETE, 14% in mETE, and 25% in gETE. The recurrence risk was increased by the presence of ETE (odds ratio [OR] = 2.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-5.85, p = 0.005) and lymph node metastases (OR = 2.44 [95% CI 1.25-4.76], p = 0.009). Patients with low-risk carcinomas w/o ETE experienced longer DFS than those with mETE (hazard ratio = 0.08 [95% CI 0.02-0.28], p < 0.001), but no significant difference was observed between intermediate risk w/o ETE, mETE, and gETE. In terms of the response to therapy, patients with gETE had higher rates of biochemical and/or structural incomplete responses within the first year of treatment (OR = 2.68 [95% CI 1.31-5.45], p = 0.007) and at the final follow-up evaluation (OR = 4.35 [95% CI 1.99-9.51], p < 0.001) compared with those with mETE. An analysis of the subgroups of microcarcinomas without lymph node metastases revealed no significant difference in DFS or the response to therapy between the low risk w/o ETE and mETE PTC groups. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that both mETE and gETE are independent risk factors for the risk of recurrence in PTC. Although gETE has a more pronounced impact on the recurrence risk and is associated with a worse response to therapy, mETE may not be associated with a low risk of recurrence. This observation suggests that patients with PTC and mETE may, in part, have an intermediate risk of recurrence and need to be followed accordingly."

        "# Title: Long-term CD4+ T-cell response to highly active antiretroviral therapy according to baseline CD4+ T-cell count.\n# Abstract: Current treatment guidelines for HIV infection recommend a relatively late initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Nevertheless, there is still a concern that immune recovery may not be as complete once CD4+ T cells have decreased below a certain threshold. This study addressed the long-term response of CD4+ T-cell counts in patients on HAART and analyzed the influence of baseline CD4+ T-cell counts, baseline viral load, and age. An observational analysis of evolution of CD4+ T cells in 861 antiretroviral therapy-naive chronic HIV-1-infected patients who started treatment consisting of at least 3 drugs in or after 1996 was performed. Patients were classified in 4 groups according to baseline CD4+ T cells: <200 cells/mm3, 200-349 cells/mm3, 350-499 cells/mm3, and >or=500 cells/mm3. The main outcome measures were proportion of patients with CD4+ T cells <200/mm3 and >500/mm3 at last determination and rate of CD4+ T-cell recovery. Patients were followed-up for a median of 173 weeks (interquartile range [IQR], 100-234). There were no differences in follow-up between the 4 groups. CD4+ T cells increased in the whole cohort from a median of 214 cells/mm3 (IQR, 90-355) to 499 cells/mm3 (IQR, 312-733) (P<0.001). Compared with the group with a baseline CD4+ T-cell count of >or=500/mm3, the relative risk of having a last determination of CD4+ T-cell counts >200 cells/mm3 was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.75-0.83), 0.92 (95% CI, 0.89-0.96) and 1 for baseline CD4+ T cells <200 cells/mm3, 200-349 cells/mm3, and 350-499 cells/mm3, respectively. The relative risk of having a last determination of CD4+ T-cell counts >500 cells/mm3 was 0.32 (95% CI, 0.27-0.39, P<0.001), 0.69 (95% CI, 0.60-0.79, P<0.001), and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.83-1.06, P=0.38) for baseline CD4+ T-cell counts <200 cells/mm3, 200-349 cells/mm3, and 350-0499 cells/mm3, respectively, compared with a baseline CD4+ T-cell count of >or=500 cells/mm3. The increase in CD4+ T cells from baseline was statistically significant and was maintained for up to 4 years of follow-up. This increase seemed to slow down after approximately 3 years and reached a plateau after 4-5 years of follow-up even in patients who achieved and maintained viral suppression in plasma. Long-term immune recovery is possible regardless of baseline CD4+ T-cell count. However, patients who start therapy with a CD4+ T-cell count <200 cells/mm3 have poorer immunologic outcome as measured by the proportion of patients with CD4+ T cells <200/mm3 or >500/mm3 at last determination. It seems that the immune recovery slows down after approximately 3 years of HAART and reaches a plateau after 4-5 years of HAART.",

        "# Title: Standard assessments of frailty are validated predictors of mortality in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis.\n# Abstract: The risk of morbidity and mortality for hospitalized patients with cirrhosis is high and incompletely captured by conventional indices. We sought to evaluate the predictive role of frailty in an observational cohort study of inpatients with decompensated cirrhosis between 2010 and 2013. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included discharge to a rehabilitation hospital, 30-day readmission, and length of stay. Frailty was assessed with three metrics: activities of daily living (ADL), the Braden Scale, and the Morse fall risk score. A predictive model was validated by randomly dividing the population into training and validation cohorts: 734 patients were admitted 1358 times in the study period. The overall 90-day mortality was 18.3%. The 30-day readmission rate was 26.6%, and the rate of discharge to a rehabilitation facility was 14.3%. Adjusting for sex, age, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, sodium, and Charlson index, the odds ratio for the effect of an ADL score of less than 12 of 15 on mortality is 1.83 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-3.20). A predictive model for 90-day mortality including ADL and Braden Scale yielded C statistics of 0.83 (95% CI 0.80-0.86) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.71-0.83) in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Discharge to a rehabilitation hospital is predicted by both the ADL (<12) and Braden Scale (<16), with respective adjusted odds ratios of 3.78 (95% CI 1.97-7.29) and 6.23 (95% CI 2.53-15.4).

However, for patients with compensated disease, data are limited regarding associations with poor patient-reported outcomes (PROs). We prospectively enrolled 300 patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension without a history of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and reviewed medical and pharmacy records. We characterized determinants of PROs using the 8-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-8) scale (0-100) and sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; poor sleep >5). Disability and frailty measures were assessed using activities of daily living (ADLs), falls, hand-grip, and chair-stands. Cognitive function was measured using weighted-lures from the Inhibitory Control Test (ICT). The median age of our cohort was 60 (interquartile range [IQR], 52-66) years, 56.3% were male, and 70% Child class A. All patients had portal hypertension, 76% had varices, and 41% had a history of ascites (predominantly well controlled). The median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease with Sodium (MELD-Na) score was 9 (IQR, 7-13). The overall median SF-8 was 70 (IQR, 54-86). Multivariate analysis showed that after adjusting for age, sex, education, and MELD-Na, performance on chair-stands (9.28 HRQOL points [95% confidence interval {CI}, 4.76-13.8] per 10-stands), ADL dependence (-6.06 [-10.8 to -1.36]), opiate use (-5.01 [-7.84 to -2.19]), benzodiazepine use (-3.50 [-6.58 to -0.42]), and ICT performance (-0.10 [-0.20 to 0.001] per weighted-lure) were significantly associated with HRQOL. Among patients completing the ICT, poor HRQOL (score <50) was significantly associated with chair-stands (odds ratio [OR] per 10-stands, 0.24; 95% CI [0.11-0.56]) and weighted lures (OR per weighted-lure, 1.01 [1.00-1.03]). Poor sleep quality was associated with opiate use (OR, 2.85 [1.11-7.29]) and lures (OR per-lure, 1.03 [1.00-1.05]).

        "# Title: Frailty Is a Risk Factor for Postoperative Mortality in Patients With Cirrhosis Undergoing Diverse Major Surgeries.\n# Abstract: With a rising burden of cirrhosis surgeries, understanding risk factors for postoperative mortality is more salient than ever. The role of baseline frailty has not been assessed in this context. We evaluated the association between patient frailty and postoperative risk among diverse patients with cirrhosis and determined if frailty improves prognostication of cirrhosis surgical risk scores. This was a retrospective cohort study of U.S. veterans with cirrhosis identified between 2008 and 2016 who underwent nontransplant major surgery. Frailty was ascertained using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS). Cox regression analysis was used to investigate the impact of patient frailty on postoperative mortality. Logistic regression was used to identify incremental changes in discrimination for postoperative mortality when frailty was added to the risk prediction models, including the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), MELD-sodium (MELD-Na), Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP), Mayo Risk Score (MRS), and Veterans Outcomes and Costs Associated With Liver Disease (VOCAL)-Penn. A total of 804 cirrhosis surgeries were identified. The majority of patients (48.5%) had high-risk frailty at baseline (HFRS >15). In adjusted Cox regression models, categories of increasing frailty scores were associated with poorer postoperative survival. For example, intermediate-risk frailty (HFRS 5-15) conferred a 1.77-fold increased hazard relative to low-risk frailty (HFRS, <5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-2.95; P = 0.03). High-risk frailty demonstrated a similarly increased hazard (hazard ratio, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.05-2.88; P = 0.03), suggesting a threshold effect of frailty on postoperative mortality. The incorporation of frailty improved discrimination of MELD, MELD-Na, and CTP for postoperative mortality, but did not do so for the MRS or VOCAL-Penn score. Patient frailty was an additional important predictor of cirrhosis surgical risk. The incorporation of preoperative frailty assessments may help to risk stratify patients, especially in settings where the MELD-Na and CTP are commonly applied.",

We examined the feasibility of inpatient frailty measurements and associations with nonhome discharge, readmission, and all-cause mortality among patients admitted for cirrhosis complications. We conducted a prospective study at 3 liver transplantation (LT) centers. Frailty was assessed using the liver frailty index (LFI). Multivariable logistic and competing risk models evaluated associations between frailty and clinical outcomes. We included 211 patients with median MELD-Na score 21 (interquartile range [IQR],15-27); 96 (45%) were women, and 102 (48%) were on the LT waiting list. At a median follow-up of 8.3 months, 29 patients (14%) were nonhome discharged, 144 (68%) were readmitted, 70 (33%) underwent LT, and 44 (21%) died. A total of 124 patients (59%) were frail, with a median LFI of 4.71 (IQR, 4.07-5.54). Frail patients were older (mean, 59 versus 54 years) and more likely to have chronic kidney disease (40% versus 20%; P = 0.002) and coronary artery disease (17% versus 7%; P = 0.03). Frailty was associated with hospital-acquired infections (8% versus 1%; P = 0.02). In multivariable models, LFI was associated with nonhome discharge (odds ratio, 1.81 per 1-point increase; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-2.86). Frailty (LFI≥4.5) was associated with all-cause mortality in models accounting for LT as competing risk (subhazard ratio [sHR], 2.4; 95% CI, 1.13-5.11); results were similar with LFI as a continuous variable (sHR, 1.62 per 1-point increase; 95% CI, 1.15-2.28).

        "# Title: Health-Related Quality of Life and Its Contributors According to a Preference-Based Generic Instrument in Cirrhosis.\n# Abstract: It is essential to determine contributors around impairment in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with cirrhosis aiming at improving health care and therapeutic strategy. Studies simultaneously incorporating disease severity based on biochemical parameters and other physical/psychological effects (i.e., sleep disturbance and frailty) are heterogeneous and the subject of the present study. We analyzed and compared HRQoL, using the EuroQol Group 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire and the utility index retrieved, in patients with cirrhosis and across groups stratified by sleep disturbance or frailty phenotype. Sleep disturbance and frailty were determined by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Frailty Index, respectively. Multiple linear regression was implemented to clarify contributors of poor HRQoL. In this cohort of 227 patients with mean age of 61.7 years and 47.2% male, more than half of the study population represented impairment in HRQoL in at least one domain, according to EQ-5D. Furthermore, sleep disturbance and frailty have proved to be independently associated with poor HRQoL in two separate regression models, whereas conventional scoring systems such as Child-Pugh classification and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease are not closely relevant. Intriguingly, not all health domains within EQ-5D correlated well with PSQI and Frailty Index, with the exception of usual activities. Pain and anxiety/depression were the most frequently affected HRQoL domains even in patients without sleep disturbance or frailty. Conclusion: Impaired HRQoL is prevalent in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Sleep disturbance and frailty are independently associated with poor HRQoL. It is imperative to timely intervene with these symptoms and deliver tailored health care.",

        "# Title: Liver Frailty Index for Prediction of Short-Term Rehospitalization in Patients with Liver Cirrhosis.\n# Abstract: Background: Stratifying patients with liver cirrhosis for risk of rehospitalization is challenging with established scoring systems for chronic liver disease. Frailty captures the physical characteristics of patients with cirrhosis. Its value for predicting short-term rehospitalizations in hospitalized patients remains to be defined. Methods: Eighty-three non-electively hospitalized patients with liver cirrhosis were analyzed in this study. Frailty was assessed during the last 48 h of hospital stay with the liver frailty index (LFI). Patients were followed for 30-day rehospitalization. Results: In total, 26 (31%) patients were rehospitalized within 30 days. The median LFI was 4.5, and 43 (52%) patients were identified as frail. Rehospitalized patients had a significant higher LFI compared to patients without a rehospitalization within 30 days. In multivariable analysis, LFI as a metric variable (OR 2.36, p = 0.02) and lower platelet count (OR 0.98, p < 0.01) were independently associated with rehospitalization. LFI and its subtest chair stands had the best discriminative ability to predict rehospitalization, with AUROCs of 0.66 and 0.67, respectively. An LFI cut-off of >4.62 discriminated best between patients with and without elevated risk for rehospitalization within 30 days. Conclusions: Measures of frailty could be useful to identify patients at higher risk for short-term rehospitalization.",

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a cross-sectional study involving individuals aged 32 to 69 years, all diagnosed with liver cirrhosis. The chronic liver disease questionnaire (CLDQ) was used to assess HR-QoL, the CLDQ score was used as an outcome to measure the factors related to HR-QoL, and the liver frailty index (LFI) was used to assess the frailty status. The association between the frailty status and the CLDQ summary scales was investigated using the correlation coefficient and multiple regression analyses. A total of 138 patients in the frail (n = 62) and non-frail (n = 76) groups with (alcohol: 97; viral: 24; autoimmune: 17; and cryptogenic: 12) were included in the study. Age, CTP score, and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) sodium were significantly higher in the frail group. In the CLDQ domains, there was a significant difference between the frail and non-frail groups (p value = 0.001). In health-related quality-of-life summary measures, there was a strong negative correlation between frailty and the scores for activities, emotional function, and fatigue (p value = 0.001). When comparing frail to non-frail patients, these characteristics demonstrated significantly increased odds as indicated by their adjusted odds ratios: OR 3.339 (p value = 0.013), OR 3.998 (p value = 0.006), and OR 4.626 (p value = 0.002), respectively."

Herein, we evaluated plasma chemokines in patients with active tuberculosis (ATB) and after completing treatment (TTB) and compared them to BCG-vaccinated healthy controls (HC). Levels of chemokines were measured by cytometric bead array. Levels of CXCL8, CXCL9 and CXCL10 were higher in ATB patients compared to HC, but they decreased in TTB. Levels of CCL2 and CCL5 in ATB patients were similar to those observed in HC. Thus, the high levels of CXC-chemokines detected during ATB, which can modulate the trafficking of immune cells from the periphery to the site of infection, were reversed by anti-mycobacterial treatment.",
        "# Title: Beyond the IFN-γ horizon: biomarkers for immunodiagnosis of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\n# Abstract: Latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (LTBI) is defined by the presence of M. tuberculosis-specific immunity in the absence of active tuberculosis. LTBI is detected using interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) or the tuberculin-skin-test (TST). In clinical practice, IGRAs and the TSTs have failed to distinguish between active tuberculosis and LTBI and their predictive value to identify individuals at risk for the future development of tuberculosis is limited. There is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that improve the clinical performance of current immunodiagnostic methods for tuberculosis prevention, diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Here, we review the landscape of potential alternative biomarkers useful for detection of infection with M. tuberculosis. We describe what individual markers add in terms of specificity for active/latent infection, prediction of progression to active tuberculosis and immunodiagnostic potential in high-risk groups' such as HIV-infected individuals and children.",
        "# Title: Diagnostic performance of a cytokine and IFN-γ-induced chemokine mRNA assay after Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigen stimulation in whole blood from infected individuals.\n# Abstract: Interferon (IFN)-γ release assays have limited sensitivity and cannot differentiate between active tuberculosis (TB) disease and latent TB infection (LTBI). Numerous cytokines and regulator factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis and control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Additional cytokines and chemokines associated with M. tuberculosis infection may improve the performance of IFN-γ release assays. We developed a real-time RT-PCR TaqMan assay for targeting levels of eight human targets [IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-10, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11] and evaluated the assay with three different study groups. Results showed that the sensitivity of TNF-α, IL-2R, and CXCL10 in the active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) group was 96.43%, 96.43%, and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity of IL-2R and CXCL10 in the latent tuberculosis infection group was 86.36% and 81.82%, respectively. Statistical results showed that TNF-α and CXCL9 were the best individual markers for differentiating between the PTB, LTBI, and non-TB groups. For optimal sensitivity and differentiation of M. tuberculosis infection status, the simultaneous detection of multiple targets was attempted. The combination of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2R, and the combination of TNF-α, IL-2R, CXCL9, and CXCL10 showed the best performance for detecting active PTB (both 100% positivity) and LTBI (86.36% and 81.82% positivity, respectively). These results imply that the combination of suitable markers is useful in efficiently diagnosing TB and differentiating M. tuberculosis infection status.",

We evaluated the potentials of 74 host markers as biomarkers for the immunological diagnosis of tuberculosis and monitoring of treatment response. Fifty-five individuals that presented with signs and symptoms requiring investigation for tuberculosis disease were prospectively recruited prior to clinical diagnosis, at a health centre in Cape Town, South Africa. Patients were later classified as having tuberculosis disease or other respiratory diseases (ORD) using a combination of clinical, radiological and laboratory findings. Out of 74 host markers that were evaluated in plasma samples from study participants using a multiplex platform, 18 showed potential as tuberculosis diagnostic candidates with the most promising being NCAM, CRP, SAP, IP-10, ferritin, TPA, I-309, and MIG, which diagnosed tuberculosis disease individually, with area under the ROC curve ≥0.80. Six-marker biosignatures containing NCAM diagnosed tuberculosis disease with a sensitivity of 100% (95%CI, 86.3-100%) and specificity of 89.3% (95%CI, 67.6-97.3%) irrespective of HIV status, and 100% accuracy in the absence of HIV infection. Furthermore, the concentrations of 11 of these proteins changed with treatment, thereby indicating that they may be useful in monitoring of the response to tuberculosis treatment. Our findings have potential to be translated into a point-of-care screening test for tuberculosis, after future validation studies.",

Seventy-nine individuals, 27 active TB, 32 latent infection subsets, 20 individuals derivative purified protein (PPD) negative (subjects that do not have any indurative cutaneous reaction after 72 hrs of intradermal injection of PPD) and with other pulmonary disease were retrospectively studied. Forty-eight analytes were evaluated by Luminex Assay in plasma obtained from whole blood stimulated cells. The diagnostic accuracies of the markers detected were evaluated by ROC curve analysis and by the combination of multiple biomarkers to improve the potential to discriminate between infection/disease and non infection. Among 48 cytokines, 13 analytes, namely IL-3, IL-12-p40, LIF, IFNα2, IL-2ra, IL-13, b-NGF, SCF, TNF-β, TRAIL, IL-2, IFN-γ, IP-10, and MIG, were significantly higher in the active TB and LTBI groups, compared to NON-TB patients, while MIF was significantly lower in active TB patients compared to NON-TB and LTBI groups. The diagnostic accuracies of the markers detected in the culture supernatants evaluated by ROC curve analysis revealed that 11 analytes (IL2, IP10, IFN-γ, IL13, MIG, SCF, b-NGF, IL12-p40, TRAIL, IL2 Ra, LIF) discriminated between NON-TB and LTBI groups, with AUC for all analytes ≥0.73, while 14 analytes (IL2, IP10, IFN-γ, MIG, SCF, b-NGF, IL12-p40, TRAIL, IL2Ra, MIF, TNF-β, IL3, IFN-α2, LIF) discriminated between NON-TB and active TB groups, with AUC ≥0.78, that is a moderate, value in terms of accuracy of a diagnostic test. Finally, the combinations of seven biomarkers resulted in the accurate prediction of 88.89% of active TB patients, 82.35% of subjects with latent infection and 90% of non-TB patients, respectively. Taken together, our data suggest that combinations of whole blood Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) antigen dependent cytokines production could be useful as biomarkers to determine tuberculosis disease states when compared to non TB cohort.",

Here, we present data from a retrospective analysis using PET/CT and PET/MRI examinations to investigate the efficacy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET for primary N-staging of patients with prostate cancer (PC) compared with morphologic imaging (CT or MRI) and validated by histopathology. Methods: Data from 58 patients with high-risk PC (according to the D'Amico criteria) who were staged with 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET/CT or PET/MRI at our institution between July 2017 and June 2018 were reviewed. The patients had a median prescan prostate-specific antigen value of 12.2 ng/mL (range, 1.2-81.6 ng/mL). The median injected activity of 18F-rhPSMA-7 was 327 MBq (range, 132-410 MBq), with a median uptake time of 79.5 min (range, 60-153 min). All patients underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection. The presence of lymph node metastases was determined by an experienced reader independently for both the PET and the morphologic datasets using a template-based analysis on a 5-point scale. Patient-level and template-based results were both compared with histopathologic findings. Results: Lymph node metastases were present in 18 patients (31.0%) and were located in 52 of 375 templates (13.9%). Receiver-operating-characteristic analyses showed 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET to perform significantly better than morphologic imaging on both patient-based and template-based analyses (areas under curve, 0.858 vs. 0.649 [P = 0.012] and 0.765 vs. 0.589 [P < 0.001], respectively). On patient-based analyses, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET were 72.2%, 92.5%, and 86.2%, respectively, and those of morphologic imaging were 50.0%, 72.5%, and 65.5%, respectively. On template-based analyses, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET were 53.8%, 96.9%, and 90.9%, respectively, and those of morphologic imaging were 9.6%, 95.0%, and 83.2%, respectively. Conclusion:18F-rhPSMA-7 PET is superior to morphologic imaging for N-staging of high-risk primary PC. The efficacy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 is similar to published data for 68Ga-PSMA-11.",

On the basis of clinical results, 18F-PSMA-1007 is a promising PSMA PET tracer, but detailed histologic confirmation has been lacking. Methods: Ninety-six patients with prostate cancer underwent 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT followed by either radical prostatectomy with lymphadenectomy or salvage lymphadenectomy. The histologic findings of PSMA PET-positive nodes were analyzed retrospectively. A lesion-based and patient-based analysis was performed comparing all positive lesions and only lesions larger than 3 mm on histopathology. Results: Of the patients, 90.6% received 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT for staging before the primary treatment, whereas 9.4% underwent imaging for biochemical recurrence. In 34.4% of the cohort, positive lymph nodes were present on imaging. In total, 1,746 lymph nodes were dissected in 96 patients. 18F-PSMA-1007 PET had a lesion-based sensitivity of 81.7%, a specificity of 99.6%, a positive predictive value of 92.4%, and a negative predictive value of 98.9% for detecting positive lymph nodes larger than 3 mm. In the analysis of all malignant nodes regardless of size, the overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value on lesion-based analysis were 71.2%, 99.5%, 91.3%, and 97.9%, respectively.

However, the contributions of lncRNAs to gastric carcinoma and their functional mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that lncRNA gastric carcinoma high expressed transcript 1 (lncRNA-GHET1) was up-regulated in gastric carcinoma. The over-expression of this lncRNA correlates with tumor size, tumor invasion and poor survival. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses demonstrated that GHET1 over-expression promotes the proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of GHET1 inhibits the proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells. RNA pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that GHET1 physically associates with insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) and enhances the physical interaction between c-Myc mRNA and IGF2BP1, consequently increasing the stability of c-Myc mRNA and expression. The expression of GHET1 and c-Myc is strongly correlated in gastric carcinoma tissues. Depletion of c-Myc abolishes the effects of GHET1 on proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that GHET1 plays a pivotal role in gastric carcinoma cell proliferation via increasing c-Myc mRNA stability and expression, which suggests potential use of GHET1 for the prognosis and treatment of gastric carcinoma.",

GHET1 expression was significantly up-regulated in HCC tissues and the higher level of GHET1 was related to vascular invasion, cirrhosis, tumor size, edmindson grade, and poor prognosis. Moreover, knockdown of GHET1 inhibited cell proliferation of HCC, and also caused cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis in HCC cell lines. We also found that GHET1 could epigenetically repress transcription of Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) in HCC cells by recruiting PRC2 into KLF2 promoter region. Our results indicated that lncRNA GHET1, as a growth regulator, might serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and therapy target for HCC.",

        "# Title: Long non-coding RNA gastric carcinoma highly expressed transcript 1 promotes cell proliferation and invasion in human head and neck cancer.\n# Abstract: Recent evidence indicates that the long non-coding RNA gastric carcinoma highly expressed transcript 1 (GHET1) is involved in the development and carcinogenesis of several tumor types; however, the exact roles of GHET1 and its underlying mechanisms in head and neck cancer (HNC) remain largely unknown. In the present study, the expression patterns of GHET1 in HNC were determined and its clinical significance was assessed. The expression level of GHET1 was significantly increased in HNC tissues, compared with paired adjacent normal tissues. High GHET1 expression was significantly associated with advanced Tumor-Node-Metastasis stages and poor prognosis. Furthermore, inhibition of GHET1 suppressed cell proliferation, induced cell apoptosis and caused cell cycle arrest in vitro. In addition, GHET1 silencing inhibited cell migration and invasion. Taken together, the results of the present study indicated that GHET1 acts as an oncogene in HNC and may represent a novel therapeutic target.",

        "# Title: Knockdown of long noncoding RNA GHET1 inhibits cell‑cycle progression and invasion of gastric cancer cells.\n# Abstract: GHET1 is an oncogenic long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that promotes the proliferation and invasion of many malignant cell types. However, the function and underlying mechanisms of lncRNA GHET1 in gastric cancer are not fully understood. In this study, the expression of GHET1 was investigated in gastric cancer and it was determined whether GHET1 may potentially be used as a biomarker for the disease. The gastric cancer cell lines MGC‑803 and AGS were transfected with GHET1‑directed small interfering RNA (siRNA) and the changes in phenotype and cell‑cycle‑related molecules were assessed. The downregulation of GHET1 induced G0/G1‑phase arrest in gastric cancer cells and inhibited their proliferation, migration, and invasion. DNA synthesis and the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) decreased, which was consistent with the results of the CCK‑8 assay. The levels of specific cell‑cycle regulators were determined and the expression and activities of positive cell‑cycle regulators (cyclin D, CDK4, CDK6, cyclin E, CDK2) were reduced, whereas those of a negative regulator (P21) were increased in GHET1‑knockdown cells. Taken together, the present findings show that the downregulation of GHET1 not only inhibits the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells, but also inhibits their proliferation, at least in part by upregulating P21 expression and downregulating cyclin and CDK expression to inhibit the G0/G1 to S phase transition. The present findings may provide a potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer."

        "# Title: Prospective and randomized evaluation of ACL reconstruction with three techniques: a clinical and radiographic evaluation at 5 years follow-up.\n# Abstract: A variety of graft sources have been used for ACL reconstruction to improve functions and kinematics in ACL deficient knees. The two most commonly used autogenous grafts are the central third of the patellar tendon and the hamstring tendon constructs. The choice of different grafts and different construct influence the final clinical outcome of ACL reconstruction. The 3 groups, of 25 patients each, were generated by choosing the technique (PT tendon, 4 strand hamstring, and single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty) to utilize and followed for 5 years, with an alternate systematic sampling. Our comparison has shown significant kneeling pain in the patellar tendon with respect to the groups with hamstrings techniques. Single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty achieved subjective score significantly higher with respect to the other two groups as well as for the time to resume sport. The study confirms that patellar tendon and hamstring can be equivalent options for ACL reconstruction. This study demonstrated that a superior outcome as far as subjective clinical findings were concerned, was obtained in group III. Patients in the latter group were also able to return to sports sooner than those in the bone-patellar tendon graft group and the four-strand hamstring group.",

The purpose of this prospective randomized study was to compare the clinical, instrumental and X-ray outcome of two ACL reconstruction techniques with hamstring tendons: one with a single intra-articular bundle associated to an extra-articular sling, the second with a more anatomic double-bundle technique that reproduces better the native ACL function. From an initial group of 100 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction, 72 patients (35 single bundle plus lateral plasty and 37 double bundle) were evaluated with IKDC, Tegner score, KT2000 arthrometer, Activity Rating Scale, Psychovitality Questionnaire and Ahlback radiographic score at a mean 3 years follow-up. Double-bundle group showed significantly better results regarding IKDC, ROM, Activity Rating Scale and time to return to sport. Also KT 2000 showed significant differences in objective stability.

We sought to evaluate the predictive role of frailty in an observational cohort study of inpatients with decompensated cirrhosis between 2010 and 2013. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included discharge to a rehabilitation hospital, 30-day readmission, and length of stay. Frailty was assessed with three metrics: activities of daily living (ADL), the Braden Scale, and the Morse fall risk score. A predictive model was validated by randomly dividing the population into training and validation cohorts: 734 patients were admitted 1358 times in the study period. The overall 90-day mortality was 18.3%. The 30-day readmission rate was 26.6%, and the rate of discharge to a rehabilitation facility was 14.3%. Adjusting for sex, age, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, sodium, and Charlson index, the odds ratio for the effect of an ADL score of less than 12 of 15 on mortality is 1.83 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-3.20). A predictive model for 90-day mortality including ADL and Braden Scale yielded C statistics of 0.83 (95% CI 0.80-0.86) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.71-0.83) in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Discharge to a rehabilitation hospital is predicted by both the ADL (<12) and Braden Scale (<16), with respective adjusted odds ratios of 3.78 (95% CI 1.97-7.29) and 6.23 (95% CI 2.53-15.4).

However, for patients with compensated disease, data are limited regarding associations with poor patient-reported outcomes (PROs). We prospectively enrolled 300 patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension without a history of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and reviewed medical and pharmacy records. We characterized determinants of PROs using the 8-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-8) scale (0-100) and sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; poor sleep >5). Disability and frailty measures were assessed using activities of daily living (ADLs), falls, hand-grip, and chair-stands. Cognitive function was measured using weighted-lures from the Inhibitory Control Test (ICT). The median age of our cohort was 60 (interquartile range [IQR], 52-66) years, 56.3% were male, and 70% Child class A. All patients had portal hypertension, 76% had varices, and 41% had a history of ascites (predominantly well controlled). The median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease with Sodium (MELD-Na) score was 9 (IQR, 7-13). The overall median SF-8 was 70 (IQR, 54-86). Multivariate analysis showed that after adjusting for age, sex, education, and MELD-Na, performance on chair-stands (9.28 HRQOL points [95% confidence interval {CI}, 4.76-13.8] per 10-stands), ADL dependence (-6.06 [-10.8 to -1.36]), opiate use (-5.01 [-7.84 to -2.19]), benzodiazepine use (-3.50 [-6.58 to -0.42]), and ICT performance (-0.10 [-0.20 to 0.001] per weighted-lure) were significantly associated with HRQOL. Among patients completing the ICT, poor HRQOL (score <50) was significantly associated with chair-stands (odds ratio [OR] per 10-stands, 0.24; 95% CI [0.11-0.56]) and weighted lures (OR per weighted-lure, 1.01 [1.00-1.03]). Poor sleep quality was associated with opiate use (OR, 2.85 [1.11-7.29]) and lures (OR per-lure, 1.03 [1.00-1.05]).

        "# Title: Frailty Is a Risk Factor for Postoperative Mortality in Patients With Cirrhosis Undergoing Diverse Major Surgeries.\n# Abstract: With a rising burden of cirrhosis surgeries, understanding risk factors for postoperative mortality is more salient than ever. The role of baseline frailty has not been assessed in this context. We evaluated the association between patient frailty and postoperative risk among diverse patients with cirrhosis and determined if frailty improves prognostication of cirrhosis surgical risk scores. This was a retrospective cohort study of U.S. veterans with cirrhosis identified between 2008 and 2016 who underwent nontransplant major surgery. Frailty was ascertained using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS). Cox regression analysis was used to investigate the impact of patient frailty on postoperative mortality. Logistic regression was used to identify incremental changes in discrimination for postoperative mortality when frailty was added to the risk prediction models, including the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), MELD-sodium (MELD-Na), Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP), Mayo Risk Score (MRS), and Veterans Outcomes and Costs Associated With Liver Disease (VOCAL)-Penn. A total of 804 cirrhosis surgeries were identified. The majority of patients (48.5%) had high-risk frailty at baseline (HFRS >15). In adjusted Cox regression models, categories of increasing frailty scores were associated with poorer postoperative survival. For example, intermediate-risk frailty (HFRS 5-15) conferred a 1.77-fold increased hazard relative to low-risk frailty (HFRS, <5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-2.95; P = 0.03). High-risk frailty demonstrated a similarly increased hazard (hazard ratio, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.05-2.88; P = 0.03), suggesting a threshold effect of frailty on postoperative mortality. The incorporation of frailty improved discrimination of MELD, MELD-Na, and CTP for postoperative mortality, but did not do so for the MRS or VOCAL-Penn score. Patient frailty was an additional important predictor of cirrhosis surgical risk. The incorporation of preoperative frailty assessments may help to risk stratify patients, especially in settings where the MELD-Na and CTP are commonly applied.",

We examined the feasibility of inpatient frailty measurements and associations with nonhome discharge, readmission, and all-cause mortality among patients admitted for cirrhosis complications. We conducted a prospective study at 3 liver transplantation (LT) centers. Frailty was assessed using the liver frailty index (LFI). Multivariable logistic and competing risk models evaluated associations between frailty and clinical outcomes. We included 211 patients with median MELD-Na score 21 (interquartile range [IQR],15-27); 96 (45%) were women, and 102 (48%) were on the LT waiting list. At a median follow-up of 8.3 months, 29 patients (14%) were nonhome discharged, 144 (68%) were readmitted, 70 (33%) underwent LT, and 44 (21%) died. A total of 124 patients (59%) were frail, with a median LFI of 4.71 (IQR, 4.07-5.54). Frail patients were older (mean, 59 versus 54 years) and more likely to have chronic kidney disease (40% versus 20%; P = 0.002) and coronary artery disease (17% versus 7%; P = 0.03). Frailty was associated with hospital-acquired infections (8% versus 1%; P = 0.02). In multivariable models, LFI was associated with nonhome discharge (odds ratio, 1.81 per 1-point increase; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-2.86). Frailty (LFI≥4.5) was associated with all-cause mortality in models accounting for LT as competing risk (subhazard ratio [sHR], 2.4; 95% CI, 1.13-5.11); results were similar with LFI as a continuous variable (sHR, 1.62 per 1-point increase; 95% CI, 1.15-2.28). A brief, objective inpatient frailty assessment was feasible and predicted nonhome discharge and mortality in decompensated cirrhosis. Inpatient point-of-care frailty assessment prior to hospital discharge can be useful for risk stratification and targeted interventions to improve physical fitness and reduce adverse outcomes.",

        "# Title: Health-Related Quality of Life and Its Contributors According to a Preference-Based Generic Instrument in Cirrhosis.\n# Abstract: It is essential to determine contributors around impairment in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with cirrhosis aiming at improving health care and therapeutic strategy. Studies simultaneously incorporating disease severity based on biochemical parameters and other physical/psychological effects (i.e., sleep disturbance and frailty) are heterogeneous and the subject of the present study. We analyzed and compared HRQoL, using the EuroQol Group 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire and the utility index retrieved, in patients with cirrhosis and across groups stratified by sleep disturbance or frailty phenotype. Sleep disturbance and frailty were determined by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Frailty Index, respectively. Multiple linear regression was implemented to clarify contributors of poor HRQoL. In this cohort of 227 patients with mean age of 61.7 years and 47.2% male, more than half of the study population represented impairment in HRQoL in at least one domain, according to EQ-5D. Furthermore, sleep disturbance and frailty have proved to be independently associated with poor HRQoL in two separate regression models, whereas conventional scoring systems such as Child-Pugh classification and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease are not closely relevant. Intriguingly, not all health domains within EQ-5D correlated well with PSQI and Frailty Index, with the exception of usual activities. Pain and anxiety/depression were the most frequently affected HRQoL domains even in patients without sleep disturbance or frailty. Conclusion: Impaired HRQoL is prevalent in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Sleep disturbance and frailty are independently associated with poor HRQoL. It is imperative to timely intervene with these symptoms and deliver tailored health care.",

        "# Title: Liver Frailty Index for Prediction of Short-Term Rehospitalization in Patients with Liver Cirrhosis.\n# Abstract: Background: Stratifying patients with liver cirrhosis for risk of rehospitalization is challenging with established scoring systems for chronic liver disease. Frailty captures the physical characteristics of patients with cirrhosis. Its value for predicting short-term rehospitalizations in hospitalized patients remains to be defined. Methods: Eighty-three non-electively hospitalized patients with liver cirrhosis were analyzed in this study. Frailty was assessed during the last 48 h of hospital stay with the liver frailty index (LFI). Patients were followed for 30-day rehospitalization. Results: In total, 26 (31%) patients were rehospitalized within 30 days. The median LFI was 4.5, and 43 (52%) patients were identified as frail. Rehospitalized patients had a significant higher LFI compared to patients without a rehospitalization within 30 days. In multivariable analysis, LFI as a metric variable (OR 2.36, p = 0.02) and lower platelet count (OR 0.98, p < 0.01) were independently associated with rehospitalization. LFI and its subtest chair stands had the best discriminative ability to predict rehospitalization, with AUROCs of 0.66 and 0.67, respectively. An LFI cut-off of >4.62 discriminated best between patients with and without elevated risk for rehospitalization within 30 days. Conclusions: Measures of frailty could be useful to identify patients at higher risk for short-term rehospitalization.",

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a cross-sectional study involving individuals aged 32 to 69 years, all diagnosed with liver cirrhosis. The chronic liver disease questionnaire (CLDQ) was used to assess HR-QoL, the CLDQ score was used as an outcome to measure the factors related to HR-QoL, and the liver frailty index (LFI) was used to assess the frailty status. The association between the frailty status and the CLDQ summary scales was investigated using the correlation coefficient and multiple regression analyses. A total of 138 patients in the frail (n = 62) and non-frail (n = 76) groups with (alcohol: 97; viral: 24; autoimmune: 17; and cryptogenic: 12) were included in the study. Age, CTP score, and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) sodium were significantly higher in the frail group. In the CLDQ domains, there was a significant difference between the frail and non-frail groups (p value = 0.001). In health-related quality-of-life summary measures, there was a strong negative correlation between frailty and the scores for activities, emotional function, and fatigue (p value = 0.001).

This single-center study was conducted to assess the accuracy of SWE in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), in comparison with transient elastography (TE), by using liver biopsy (LB) as the reference standard. Consecutive patients with CHC scheduled for LB by referring physicians were studied. One hundred and twenty-one patients met inclusion criteria. On the same day, real-time SWE using the ultrasound (US) system, Aixplorer (SuperSonic Imagine S.A., Aix-en-Provence, France), TE using FibroScan (Echosens, Paris, France), and US-assisted LB were consecutively performed. Fibrosis was staged according to the METAVIR scoring system. Analyses of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were performed to calculate optimal area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for F0-F1 versus F2-F4, F0- F2 versus F3-F4, and F0-F3 versus F4 for both real-time SWE and TE. Liver stiffness values increased in parallel with degree of liver fibrosis, both with SWE and TE. AUROCs were 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-0.96) for SWE and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.76-0.90) for TE (P = 0.002), 0.98 (95% CI: 0.94-1.00) for SWE and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.90-0.99) for TE (P = 0.14), and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.93-1.00) for SWE and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.91-0.99) for TE (P = 0.48), when comparing F0-F1 versus F2- F4, F0- F2 versus F3-F4, and F0 -F3 versus F4, respectively.",

A total of 1440 measurements were made. Reproducibility was assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and a repeated measures analysis of variance. The shear wave speed was measured and used to estimate Young's modulus using the Supersonics Imagine Aixplorer. The median Young's modulus measured through the inter-costal space was 5.55 ± 0.74 kPa. The intra-operator reliability was better for same-day evaluations (ICC = 0.91) than the inter-operator reliability (ICC = 0.78). Intra-observer agreement decreased when scans were repeated on a different day. Inter-session repeatability was between 3.3% and 9.9% for intra-day repeated scans, compared with to 6.5%-12% for inter-day repeated scans.

The rate of reliable liver stiffness measurements was significantly higher with 2-D SWE than with TE: 99.2% versus 74.8%, p < 0.0001 (different reliability criteria used, according to current recommendations). In univariate analysis, liver stiffness measured with 2-D SWE correlated best with fibrosis stage estimated with TE (r = 0.699, p < 0.0001), followed by Forns score (r = 0.534, p < 0.0001) and King's score (r = 0.512, p < 0.0001). However, in multivariate analysis, only 2-D SWE-measured values remained correlated with fibrosis stage (p < 0.0001).

It can evaluate larger regions of interest and, therefore, might be better at determining the overall fibrosis distribution. The aim of this prospective study was to compare 2-D SWE with the two best evaluated liver elastography methods, transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse (point SWE using acoustic radiation force impulse) imaging, in the same population group. The study included 132 patients with chronic hepatopathies, in which liver stiffness was evaluated using transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging and 2-D SWE. The reference methods were liver biopsy for the assessment of liver fibrosis (n = 101) and magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography for the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis (n = 31). No significant difference in diagnostic accuracy, assessed as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), was found between the three elastography methods (2-D SWE, transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging) for the diagnosis of significant and advanced fibrosis and liver cirrhosis in the \"per protocol\" (AUROCs for fibrosis stages ≥2: 0.90, 0.95 and 0.91; for fibrosis stage [F] ≥3: 0.93, 0.95 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.92, 0.96 and 0.92) and \"intention to diagnose\" cohort (AUROCs for F ≥2: 0.87, 0.92 and 0.91; for F ≥3: 0.91, 0.93 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.88, 0.90 and 0.89).

The goal of this study was to assess the clinical use of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) evaluated by supersonic shear imaging (SSI), FibroScan, and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) in a cohort of NAFLD patients who underwent liver biopsy. A total of 291 NAFLD patients were prospectively enrolled from November 2011 to February 2015 at 2 French university hospitals. LSM was assessed by SSI, FibroScan (M probe), and ARFI within two weeks prior to liver biopsy. Calculations of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) were performed and compared for the staging of liver fibrosis. AUROC for SSI, FibroScan, and ARFI were 0.86, 0.82, and 0.77 for diagnoses of ≥F2; 0.89, 0.86, and 0.84 for ≥F3; and 0.88, 0.87, and 0.84 for F4, respectively. SSI had a higher accuracy than ARFI for diagnoses of significant fibrosis (≥F2) (P = 0.004). Clinical factors related to obesity such as body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2) , waist circumference ≥102 cm or increased parietal wall thickness were associated with LSM failures when using SSI or FibroScan and with unreliable results when using ARFI. In univariate analysis, FibroScan values were slightly correlated with NAFLD activity score and steatosis (R = 0.28 and 0.22, respectively), whereas SSI and ARFI were not; however, these components of NAFLD did not affect LSM results in multivariate analysis. The cutoff values for SSI and FibroScan for staging fibrosis with a sensitivity ≥90% were very close: 6.3/6.2 kPa for ≥F2, 8.3/8.2 kPa for ≥F3, and 10.5/9.5 kPa for F4.",

Patients with CHB infection who underwent liver biopsy were consecutively included. After exclusions, 257 patients were analyzed. Two-dimensional SWE resulted in a significantly higher rate of reliable measurements (98.1%, 252/257) than TE (93.0%, 239/257) (p = 0.011).

The purpose of this study was to perform an intra-individual comparison between 2-D shear wave elastography (2-D-SWE with a GE system) and Virtual Touch Tissue Quantification (VTTQ with a Siemens system) to assess whether these can be used interchangeably to grade fibrosis. Ninety-three patients (51 men, 42 women; mean age, 54 y) with liver disease of various etiologies (hepatitis B virus = 47, hepatitis C virus = 22; alcohol = 6, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis = 5, other = 13) were included. Using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values, liver fibrosis was classified into clinically non-significant (F0/F1) and significant (≥F2) fibrosis. Results indicated that intra-modality repeatability was excellent for both techniques (GE 2-D-SWE: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.89 [0.84-0.93]; VTTQ: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.90 [0.86-0.93]). Intra-modality classification agreement for fibrosis grading was good to excellent (GE 2-D-SWE: κ = 0.65, VTTQ: κ = 0.82). However, inter-modality agreement for fibrosis grading was only fair (κ = 0.31) using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values of fibrosis. In conclusion, although both GE 2-D-SWE and Siemens VTTQ exhibit good to excellent intra-modality repeatability, inter-modality agreement is only fair, suggesting that these should not be used interchangeably.",

Twenty children on dialysis intended to perform a 12-week graded community-based exercise program. Exercise capacity and fatigue level were studied; muscle force and health-related quality of life were secondary outcomes. All outcomes were measured at baseline (T = 0) and after intervention (T = 1). Fourteen of the 20 patients (70%) either did not start the program or did not complete the program. Of these patients, seven did not complete or even start the exercise program because of a combination of lack of time and motivational problems. Six patients were not able to continue the program or were unable to do the follow-up measurements because of medical problems. Exercise capacity and muscle strength was higher after the exercise program in the children who completed the training. In conclusion, exercise training is difficult to perform in children with ESRD and is not always feasible in real-life situations for many children with ESRD.",

We assessed lower extremity strength (Biodex; dominant extension peak torque in 60 degrees per second, Newton-meters), grip strength (dynanometer, kilogram) and 6-min walk capacity (yards) in ten children (median age 13.6 years, range 8-25 years) at baseline and after 3 months of twice weekly exercise for 1 h during HD. Baseline assessment revealed a mean (1) Biodex of 70 +/- 32 N-m/s, (2) 6-m walk test of 589 +/- 90 yards and (3) grip strength of 23.2 +/- 10 kg, which were 50% lower than the normal value for healthy controls. Patients demonstrated significant improvements in lower extremity strength and 6-min walk test after 3 months of exercise. Our data show that twice-weekly exercise of a moderate intensity during HD can lead to exercise capacity improvement in 3 months.

Aerobic, strengthening exercises, and exergames are reported as effective in the treatment of symptoms associated with CKD. Unlike adult patients, there are insufficient studies investigating the effects of exercise on disease-related symptoms in pediatric CKD. This study aimed to compare the effects of Nintendo Wii-based exergaming and home-based fun video exercises on functional capacity, muscle strength, physical activity (PA), depression, fatigue, and QoL in pediatric patients with CKD. Twenty-three pediatric patients with CKD were included in the study and randomized to group I (Nintendo Wii Fit) and group II (home-based fun video exercises). Patients in both groups underwent exercise programs twice per week for 6 weeks. Functional capacity, muscle strength, PA, QoL, fatigue, and depression of the patients were evaluated before and after the treatments. Sixteen patients completed the study. After treatment, significant differences were observed in both groups on 6MWT, muscle strength, average daily steps, PedsQoL Child Self-Report PHSS, and the Visual Fatigue Scale. Left knee flexor muscle strength and average step counts were found to be superior in group I. Both exergaming and home-based fun video exercises provide positive effects on functional capacity, muscle strength, fatigue, PA, depression, and QoL in pediatric patients with CKD. We think that these exercise methods can help to protect physical and mental health of patients and should be included in treatment from the early stages of the disease."

Nevertheless, there is still a concern that immune recovery may not be as complete once CD4+ T cells have decreased below a certain threshold. This study addressed the long-term response of CD4+ T-cell counts in patients on HAART and analyzed the influence of baseline CD4+ T-cell counts, baseline viral load, and age. An observational analysis of evolution of CD4+ T cells in 861 antiretroviral therapy-naive chronic HIV-1-infected patients who started treatment consisting of at least 3 drugs in or after 1996 was performed. Patients were classified in 4 groups according to baseline CD4+ T cells: <200 cells/mm3, 200-349 cells/mm3, 350-499 cells/mm3, and >or=500 cells/mm3. The main outcome measures were proportion of patients with CD4+ T cells <200/mm3 and >500/mm3 at last determination and rate of CD4+ T-cell recovery. Patients were followed-up for a median of 173 weeks (interquartile range [IQR], 100-234). There were no differences in follow-up between the 4 groups. CD4+ T cells increased in the whole cohort from a median of 214 cells/mm3 (IQR, 90-355) to 499 cells/mm3 (IQR, 312-733) (P<0.001). Compared with the group with a baseline CD4+ T-cell count of >or=500/mm3, the relative risk of having a last determination of CD4+ T-cell counts >200 cells/mm3 was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.75-0.83), 0.92 (95% CI, 0.89-0.96) and 1 for baseline CD4+ T cells <200 cells/mm3, 200-349 cells/mm3, and 350-499 cells/mm3, respectively. The relative risk of having a last determination of CD4+ T-cell counts >500 cells/mm3 was 0.32 (95% CI, 0.27-0.39, P<0.001), 0.69 (95% CI, 0.60-0.79, P<0.001), and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.83-1.06, P=0.38) for baseline CD4+ T-cell counts <200 cells/mm3, 200-349 cells/mm3, and 350-0499 cells/mm3, respectively, compared with a baseline CD4+ T-cell count of >or=500 cells/mm3. The increase in CD4+ T cells from baseline was statistically significant and was maintained for up to 4 years of follow-up. This increase seemed to slow down after approximately 3 years and reached a plateau after 4-5 years of follow-up even in patients who achieved and maintained viral suppression in plasma. Long-term immune recovery is possible regardless of baseline CD4+ T-cell count. However, patients who start therapy with a CD4+ T-cell count <200 cells/mm3 have poorer immunologic outcome as measured by the proportion of patients with CD4+ T cells <200/mm3 or >500/mm3 at last determination. It seems that the immune recovery slows down after approximately 3 years of HAART and reaches a plateau after 4-5 years of HAART.",

        "# Title: Prospective and randomized evaluation of ACL reconstruction with three techniques: a clinical and radiographic evaluation at 5 years follow-up.\n# Abstract: A variety of graft sources have been used for ACL reconstruction to improve functions and kinematics in ACL deficient knees. The two most commonly used autogenous grafts are the central third of the patellar tendon and the hamstring tendon constructs. The choice of different grafts and different construct influence the final clinical outcome of ACL reconstruction. The 3 groups, of 25 patients each, were generated by choosing the technique (PT tendon, 4 strand hamstring, and single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty) to utilize and followed for 5 years, with an alternate systematic sampling. Our comparison has shown significant kneeling pain in the patellar tendon with respect to the groups with hamstrings techniques. Single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty achieved subjective score significantly higher with respect to the other two groups as well as for the time to resume sport. The study confirms that patellar tendon and hamstring can be equivalent options for ACL reconstruction. This study demonstrated that a superior outcome as far as subjective clinical findings were concerned, was obtained in group III. Patients in the latter group were also able to return to sports sooner than those in the bone-patellar tendon graft group and the four-strand hamstring group.",

The purpose of this prospective randomized study was to compare the clinical, instrumental and X-ray outcome of two ACL reconstruction techniques with hamstring tendons: one with a single intra-articular bundle associated to an extra-articular sling, the second with a more anatomic double-bundle technique that reproduces better the native ACL function. From an initial group of 100 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction, 72 patients (35 single bundle plus lateral plasty and 37 double bundle) were evaluated with IKDC, Tegner score, KT2000 arthrometer, Activity Rating Scale, Psychovitality Questionnaire and Ahlback radiographic score at a mean 3 years follow-up. Double-bundle group showed significantly better results regarding IKDC, ROM, Activity Rating Scale and time to return to sport. Also KT 2000 showed significant differences in objective stability.

Four hundred twenty-nine patients had migraine, of which 16.5% reported that headaches could be precipitated by cheese or chocolate, and nearly always both. Of the migraine patients, 18.4% reported sensitivity to all alcoholic drinks, while another 11.8% were sensitive to red wine but not to white wine; 28% of the migrainous patients reported that beer would precipitate headaches. There was a definite statistical association between sensitivity to cheese/chocolate and to red wine (P < 0.001) and also to beer (P < 0.001), but none between diet sensitivity and sensitivity to alcoholic drinks in general. None of 40 patients with tension headache (diagnosed by International Headache Society criteria) reported sensitivity to foods, and only one was sensitive to alcoholic drinks. The prevalence of sensitivity among 46 patients with some migrainous features was intermediate between the migraine and tension headache categories. It is concluded that cheese/chocolate and red wine sensitivity, in particular, have closely related mechanisms, in some way related more to migraine than to more chronic tension-type headache, while quite separate mechanisms play a major role in sensitivity to alcoholic drinks in general.",

Questionnaire-based information on smoking was available in 95% and on alcohol in 89% of the individuals. Associations were assessed in multivariate analyses, estimating prevalence odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Prevalence rates for headache were higher amongst smokers compared with never smokers, most evident for those under 40 years smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.6). Passive smoking was also associated with higher headache prevalence. For alcohol use, there was a tendency of decreasing prevalence of migraine with increasing amounts of alcohol consumption compared with alcohol abstinence. Only with regard to symptoms indicating alcohol overuse, a positive association with frequent headache was found. The association between headache and smoking found in the present study raises questions about a causal relationship, e.g. that smoking causes headache or that it allays stress induced by headache.

However, the contributions of lncRNAs to gastric carcinoma and their functional mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that lncRNA gastric carcinoma high expressed transcript 1 (lncRNA-GHET1) was up-regulated in gastric carcinoma. The over-expression of this lncRNA correlates with tumor size, tumor invasion and poor survival. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses demonstrated that GHET1 over-expression promotes the proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of GHET1 inhibits the proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells. RNA pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that GHET1 physically associates with insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) and enhances the physical interaction between c-Myc mRNA and IGF2BP1, consequently increasing the stability of c-Myc mRNA and expression. The expression of GHET1 and c-Myc is strongly correlated in gastric carcinoma tissues. Depletion of c-Myc abolishes the effects of GHET1 on proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that GHET1 plays a pivotal role in gastric carcinoma cell proliferation via increasing c-Myc mRNA stability and expression, which suggests potential use of GHET1 for the prognosis and treatment of gastric carcinoma.",

Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) attract much attention of researchers, and they are demonstrated to be dysregulated in a variety of cancers, including HCC. LncRNA gastric carcinoma high expressed transcript 1 lncRNA GHET1 is found to be dysregulated in gastric cancer (GC). However, its clinical value and potential biological function in HCC remains unclear. In this study, the expression level of GHET1 was analyzed in 72 HCC tissues and matched normal tissues by using Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). GHET1 expression was significantly up-regulated in HCC tissues and the higher level of GHET1 was related to vascular invasion, cirrhosis, tumor size, edmindson grade, and poor prognosis. Moreover, knockdown of GHET1 inhibited cell proliferation of HCC, and also caused cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis in HCC cell lines.

In the present study, the expression patterns of GHET1 in HNC were determined and its clinical significance was assessed. The expression level of GHET1 was significantly increased in HNC tissues, compared with paired adjacent normal tissues. High GHET1 expression was significantly associated with advanced Tumor-Node-Metastasis stages and poor prognosis. Furthermore, inhibition of GHET1 suppressed cell proliferation, induced cell apoptosis and caused cell cycle arrest in vitro. In addition, GHET1 silencing inhibited cell migration and invasion. Taken together, the results of the present study indicated that GHET1 acts as an oncogene in HNC and may represent a novel therapeutic target.",

        "# Title: Knockdown of long noncoding RNA GHET1 inhibits cell‑cycle progression and invasion of gastric cancer cells.\n# Abstract: GHET1 is an oncogenic long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that promotes the proliferation and invasion of many malignant cell types. However, the function and underlying mechanisms of lncRNA GHET1 in gastric cancer are not fully understood. In this study, the expression of GHET1 was investigated in gastric cancer and it was determined whether GHET1 may potentially be used as a biomarker for the disease. The gastric cancer cell lines MGC‑803 and AGS were transfected with GHET1‑directed small interfering RNA (siRNA) and the changes in phenotype and cell‑cycle‑related molecules were assessed. The downregulation of GHET1 induced G0/G1‑phase arrest in gastric cancer cells and inhibited their proliferation, migration, and invasion. DNA synthesis and the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) decreased, which was consistent with the results of the CCK‑8 assay. The levels of specific cell‑cycle regulators were determined and the expression and activities of positive cell‑cycle regulators (cyclin D, CDK4, CDK6, cyclin E, CDK2) were reduced, whereas those of a negative regulator (P21) were increased in GHET1‑knockdown cells. Taken together, the present findings show that the downregulation of GHET1 not only inhibits the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells, but also inhibits their proliferation, at least in part by upregulating P21 expression and downregulating cyclin and CDK expression to inhibit the G0/G1 to S phase transition. The present findings may provide a potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer."

We performed a multicenter study to determine associations of AKI (increasing admission-to-terminal serum creatinine by AKI Network stages) with kidney discard, delayed graft function (DGF) and 6-month estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). In 1632 donors, kidney discard risk increased for AKI stages 1, 2 and 3 (compared to no AKI) with adjusted relative risks of 1.28 (1.08-1.52), 1.82 (1.45-2.30) and 2.74 (2.0-3.75), respectively. Adjusted relative risk for DGF also increased by donor AKI stage: 1.27 (1.09-1.49), 1.70 (1.37-2.12) and 2.25 (1.74-2.91), respectively. Six-month eGFR, however, was similar across AKI categories but was lower for recipients with DGF (48 [interquartile range: 31-61] vs. 58 [45-75] ml/min/1.73m(2) for no DGF, p < 0.001). There was significant favorable interaction between donor AKI and DGF such that 6-month eGFR was progressively better for DGF kidneys with increasing donor AKI (46 [29-60], 49 [32-64], 52 [36-59] and 58 [39-71] ml/min/1.73m(2) for no AKI, stage 1, 2 and 3, respectively; interaction p = 0.05).

We included all patients who received deceased donor kidney transplant from June 2004 to October 2013. There were 162 AKI donor transplant recipients (21% of deceased donor transplants): 139 in the standard criteria donor (SCD) and 23 in the expanded criteria donor (ECD) cohort. 71% of the AKI donors had stage 3 (severe AKI), based on acute kidney injury network (AKIN) staging. Protocol biopsies were done at 1, 4, and 12 months posttransplant. One and four month formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies from 48 patients (24 AKI donors, 24 non-AKI) underwent global gene expression profiling using DNA microarrays (96 arrays). DGF was more common in the AKI group but eGFR, graft survival at 1 year and proportion with IF/TA>2 at 1 year were similar for the two groups. At 1 month, there were 898 differentially expressed genes in the AKI group (p-value <0.005; FDR <10%), but by 4 months there were no differences.

To determine whether this policy is justified, we analyzed outcomes of donor kidneys with acute kidney injury (AKI) in a large UK cohort. A retrospective analysis of the UK Transplant Registry evaluated deceased donors between 2003 and 2013. Donors were classified as no AKI, or AKI stage 1-3 according to Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Relationship of AKI with delayed graft function/primary nonfunction (DGF/PNF), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and graft-survival at 90 days and 1 year was analyzed. There were 11 219 kidneys (1869 [17%] with AKI) included. Graft failure at 1 year is greater for donors with AKI than for those without (graft survival 89% vs. 91%, p = 0.02; odds ratio (OR) 1.20 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.41]). DGF rates increase with donor AKI stage (p < 0.005), and PNF rates are significantly higher for AKIN stage 3 kidneys (9% vs. 4%, p = 0.04) Analysis of association between AKI and recipient eGFR suggests a risk of inferior eGFR with AKI versus no AKI (p < 0.005; OR 1.25 [95% CI: 1.08-1.31]). We report a small reduction in 1-year graft-survival of kidneys from donors with AKI. We conclude that AKI stage 1 or 2 kidneys should be used; however, caution is advised for AKI stage 3 donors.",

We aimed to evaluate the impact of donors' AKI severity and trend on graft outcomes in DDK transplantation. This was a retrospective study of DDK transplantation performed from 2005 to 2014. Based on maximum and terminal serum creatinine values before transplantation, the AKI trends were categorized as improving or worsening. Of 413 DDKs, 275 developed AKI: 177 stage 1, 52 stage 2, and 46 stage 3. DDKs with AKI had 212 improving AKI and 63 worsening AKI. Graft outcomes were similar based on AKI stage. Worsening AKI did not affect delayed graft function development; however, it significantly elevated graft failure risk even after adjusting for AKI stage and Kidney Donor Risk Index. Graft survival of the improving group was similar to DDKs with no AKI. This study showed that AKI severity of DDKs did not affect overall graft outcomes. Notably, DDKs with improving AKI showed a similar graft survival rate to DDKs without AKI, although worsening AKI had a worse prognosis. Consideration of the AKI trend, rather than its severity, is needed when DDKs with AKI are allocated.",
        "# Title: Deceased-donor acute kidney injury is not associated with kidney allograft failure.\n# Abstract: Deceased-donor acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with organ discard and delayed graft function, but data on longer-term allograft survival are limited. We performed a multicenter study to determine associations between donor AKI (from none to severe based on AKI Network stages) and all-cause graft failure, adjusting for donor, transplant, and recipient factors. We examined whether any of the following factors modified the relationship between donor AKI and graft survival: kidney donor profile index, cold ischemia time, donation after cardiac death, expanded-criteria donation, kidney machine perfusion, donor-recipient gender combinations, or delayed graft function. We also evaluated the association between donor AKI and a 3-year composite outcome of all-cause graft failure or estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 in a subcohort of 30% of recipients. Among 2,430 kidneys transplanted from 1,298 deceased donors, 585 (24%) were from donors with AKI. Over a median follow-up of 4.0 years, there were no significant differences in graft survival by donor AKI stage. We found no evidence that pre-specified variables modified the effect of donor AKI on graft survival. In the subcohort, donor AKI was not associated with the 3-year composite outcome. Donor AKI was not associated with graft failure in this well-phenotyped cohort. Given the organ shortage, the transplant community should consider measures to increase utilization of kidneys from deceased donors with AKI.",
        "# Title: Success of kidney transplantations from deceased donors with acute kidney injury.\n# Abstract: BACKGROUND The acceptance of organs from deceased donors with acute kidney injury (AKI) varies considerably, with uncertain outcomes. The current organ shortage has led to increased use of marginal donor organs. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective, single-center study included 642 patients who underwent kidney allograft transplantation between 2005 and 2016. The recipients were categorized into 3 groups: AKI-1 (n=214), comprising donors with a peak serum creatinine (SCr) level of 1.1-2.0 mg/dl; AKI-2 (n=89), comprising donors with a peak SCr level >2 mg/dl; and non-AKI (n=339), comprising donors with normal kidney function (SCr <1.1 mg/dl). RESULTS The cumulative survival rates for patients and grafts did not significantly differ among the AKI-1, AKI-2, and non-AKI groups at the 1-year (91.6%/79.4%, 92.1%/83.1%, 95.3%/88.5%, respectively) and 5-year assessments (79.4%/67.8%, 86.8%/71.7%, 80.5%/71.1%, respectively). These findings were corroborated by mean SCr values and estimated glomerular filtration rates at the 1-year (2.08±1.7/51.16±23.45, 2.01±1.52/56.46±23.63, 1.81±1.13/55.44±23.26 mg/dl, respectively) and 5-year assessments (1.91±1.28/51.06±24.65, 1.74±0.66/57.44±31.21, 1.7±0.88/58.56±26.04 mg/dl, respectively). The incidence of delayed graft function in each group was 29.9%, 44.9%, and 28.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Kidney transplantation from donors with AKI, although associated with a higher rate of delayed graft function, results in good long-term transplant survival and reliable kidney functionality after 5 years. The inclusion of donors with AKI may widely extend the pool of available organs; however, careful donor selection is necessary.",

We investigated the effect of donor AKI on renal function and chronic changes on protocol biopsies at 1-year post-transplant. Donor AKI was defined according to Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Between 2013 and 2017, 333 kidneys were transplanted and subsequently biopsied after 1 year. Fifty-three kidneys from AKI donors (AKIN stage I n = 42, stage II n = 8, stage III n = 3) were compared to 280 kidneys from non-AKI donors. At 1-year follow-up, patient and graft survival were comparable. Donor AKI was not predictive of IFTA (Banff interstitial fibrosis plus tubular atrophy scores) at 1-year post-transplant biopsy (2.10 ± 1.28 in AKI, 2.09 ± 1.22 in non-AKI, P = .95). Donor AKI was also not associated with progression of IFTA from 3 to 12 months (P = .69), or inferior glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, P = .94). In a multivariate analysis, the odds of IFTA >2 were comparable between AKI and non-AKI groups. In conclusion, the transplantation of kidneys from donors with predominantly stage I AKI results in comparable function and degree of fibrosis on protocol biopsies 1-year post-transplant. Selected grafts from donors with AKI are a valuable tool for expanding the donor pool for kidney transplantation.",

All patients who underwent KT from DBD donors between June 2003 and April 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. The KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) criteria were used to classify donor AKI. The cohort included 376 donors (no AKI group, n = 117 [31.1%]; AKI group n = 259 [68.9%]). Death-censored graft survival was similar according to the presence of AKI, AKI severity, and the AKI trend (p = 0.929, p = 0.077, and p = 0.658, respectively). Patients whose donors had AKI who received using low dose (1.5 mg/kg for three days) rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (r-ATG) as the induction agent had significantly superior death-censored graft survival compared with patients in that group who received basiliximab (p = 0.039).

This study aimed to analyze the selection trends of AKI donors and investigate the impact of AKI on graft failure using the United states cohort data. We analyzed a total 52,757 KTs collected in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipient (SRTR) from 2010 to 2015. The sample included 4,962 (9.4%) cases of KTs with AKI donors (creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dL). Clinical characteristics of AKI and non-AKI donors were analyzed and outcomes of both groups were compared. We also analyzed risk factors for graft failure in AKI donor KTs. Although the incidence of delayed graft function was higher in recipients of AKI donors compared to non-AKI donors, graft and patient survival were not significantly different between the two groups. We found donor hypertension, cold ischemic time, the proportion of African American donors, and high KDPI were risk factors for graft failure in AKI donor KTs. KTs from deceased donor with AKI showed comparable outcomes. Thus, donors with AKI need to be considered more actively to expand donor pool. Caution is still needed when donors have additional risk factors of graft failure.",

Kidneys from ≥65-year-old donors with comorbidities are more susceptible to cold ischemia time (CIT) and DGF and it is unknown whether such elderly kidneys with AKI can also be transplanted with satisfactory outcomes. All KTs from ≥65-year-old donors performed at our center from 1999 to 2019 (n = 233) were retrospectively analyzed and short- as well as long-term outcomes were compared for KTs from donors with (n = 64) and without AKI (n = 169). There were no significant differences regarding the frequency of DGF as well as the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 1 and 3 years post-transplant between the no-AKI and the AKI group (DGF: no-AKI 30.2% vs. AKI 40.6%, P = .17; eGFR at 1-year: 31.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 vs. 35.5 ml/min/1.73 m2 , P = .32; at 3-years: 33.8 ml/min/1.73 m2 vs. 40.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 , P = .18; respectively). Death-censored graft survival and patient survival were also not significantly different. Multivariable Cox regression analysis did not identify AKI as a significant risk factor for graft loss or death. Following careful donor and recipient selection, kidneys from ≥65-year-old AKI donors may potentially be transplanted with satisfactory outcomes.",

Loss of LKB1 promotes cancer progression and influences therapeutic responses in preclinical studies; however, specific targeted therapies for lung cancer with LKB1 inactivation are currently unavailable. Here, we have identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) signature that is associated with the loss of LKB1 function. We discovered that LINC00473 is consistently the most highly induced gene in LKB1-inactivated human primary NSCLC samples and derived cell lines. Elevated LINC00473 expression correlated with poor prognosis, and sustained LINC00473 expression was required for the growth and survival of LKB1-inactivated NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, LINC00473 was induced by LKB1 inactivation and subsequent cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)/CREB-regulated transcription coactivator (CRTC) activation. We determined that LINC00473 is a nuclear lncRNA and interacts with NONO, a component of the cAMP signaling pathway, thereby facilitating CRTC/CREB-mediated transcription. Collectively, our study demonstrates that LINC00473 expression potentially serves as a robust biomarker for tumor LKB1 functional status that can be integrated into clinical trials for patient selection and treatment evaluation, and implicates LINC00473 as a therapeutic target for LKB1-inactivated NSCLC.",

The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00473 is increased in some human cancer tissues and it plays important roles in tumorigenesis. However, neither the expression pattern nor the biological functions of LINC00473 have been elucidated in cervical cancer so far. In the present study, gain- and loss-of-function assays showed that LINC00473 promoted cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis in cervical cancer cells in vitro. Moreover, we found that LINC00473 enhanced the growth of cervical cancer cells in vivo. Mechanistic investigation showed that LINC00473 directly interacted with ILF2 and suppressed its degradation. Finally, we demonstrated that miR-34a reduced the stability of LINC00473. These findings may have important implications for developing novel therapeutic strategies for cervical cancer.",
        "# Title: Long noncoding RNA LNC473 inhibits the ubiquitination of survivin via association with USP9X and enhances cell proliferation and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.\n# Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Recent studies reported that lncRNA LINC00473 (LNC473) was involved in cancer progression. However, the clinical significance and functional role of LNC473 in HCC progression is still unknown. In the present study, we found that the LNC473 expression was markedly elevated in HCC tissues and correlated with bigger tumor size, higher BCLC stage, vascular invasion and poor prognosis. Gain- and loss-of-function assay showed that LNC473 enhanced HCC cell proliferation and invasion and induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Mechanistically, LNC473 associated with oncoprotein survivin and regulates its stability. Moreover, LNC473 could recruit deubiquitinase USP9X to inhibit the ubiquitination level of survivin and then increase survivin expression. Therefore, our results suggest that LNC473 exerts its functions as an oncogene in HCC progression and may be a therapeutic target for HCC treatment.",

However, the clinical value and biological function of LINC00473 in gastric cancer (GC) was still unknown. In our results, LINC00473 expression was increased in GC tissue samples and GC cell lines compared with paired adjacent normal stomach tissue samples and normal gastric epithelial cell line, respectively. High-expression of LINC00473 was correlated with poor histological type, advanced clinical stage, more lymph node metastasis and present distant metastasis. The results of Kaplan-Meier analysis and TCGA database similarly suggested that GC patients with LINC00473 high-expression had poorer prognosis than GC patients with LINC00473 low-expression. Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that LINC00473 high-expression served as independent unfavorable prognostic factor for overall survival in GC patients. The study in vitro indicated that silencing of LINC00473 had no effect on GC cell viability, but inhibited GC cell migration and invasion through modulating MMP2 and MMP9 expression. In conclusion, LINC00473 is associated with the malignant status and prognosis in GC cases, and functions as an oncogenic lncRNA to regulate GC cell migration and invasion.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of LINC00473 and underlying mechanisms in BC. Expression pattern of LINC00473 was analyzed using qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) assays in BC tissues and cells. Overexpression or knockdown of LINC00473 in vitro and functional experiments were performed to study its effects on BC cells. Target prediction, luciferase assays, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and RNA immunoprecipitation were used to verify the role of LINC00473 as a competing endogenous RNA. The impact of LINC00473 on tumor growth was also evaluated using a xenograft model. In our study, we found that LINC00473 was highly expressed in BC tissues and cells, and the elevated expression was correlated with shorter overall survival in patients with BC. Furthermore, knockdown of LINC00473 significantly inhibited the capacity of proliferation, invasion and migration of BC cells. Animal experiment suggested that silencing LINC00473 could significantly inhibit the tumor growth. Following experiments revealed that LINC00473 may function as a competing endogenous RNA to regulate the expression of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1 (MAPK1) through competition for miR-198. Thus, increased expression of LINC00473 in breast cancer tissues is linked to poor prognosis. LINC00473 may function as an endogenous completive RNA by sponging miR-198 to regulate MAPK1 expression. Findings of our study contributed to the basis for further exploring the application of LINC00473 as a prognostic and diagnostic biomarker.",

Long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00473 has been reported as potentially critical regulators in various types of cancer tumorigenesis. However, the effects of LINC00473 on glioma cells is unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the clinical significance, effects and mechanism of LINC00437 on glioma tumorigenesis. In the present study, LINC00473 was significantly increased in glioma tissues and in cell models, and predicted a poor prognosis in patients with glioma. Notably, LINC00473 knockdown not only suppressed cell proliferation, invasion and migration of glioma cells, but also blocked cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis. Subcutaneous xenotransplanted tumor model experiments revealed that reduced LINC00473 expression was able to suppress in vivo glioma growth. Mechanistically, LINC00473 functioned as a competing endogenous (ce)RNA to decrease microRNA (miR)‑195‑5p expression. Moreover, Yes‑associated protein 1 (YAP1) and TEA domain family member 1 (TEAD1) were identified as downstream targets of miR‑195‑5p, whose expression levels were inhibited by miR‑195‑5p. LINC00473 knockdown suppressed glioma progression through the decrease of miR‑195‑5p and subsequent increase of YAP1 and TEAD1 expression levels. These results indicated LINC00473 might act as a ceRNA to sponge miR‑195‑5p, thus promoting YAP1 and TEAD1 expressions, and shedding light on the underlying mechanisms of LINC00473‑induced glioma progression.",
        "# Title: LINC00473 contributes to the radioresistance of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by regulating microRNA‑497‑5p and cell division cycle 25A.\n# Abstract: Long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00473 plays a carcinogenic role in a variety of different tumor types. Nevertheless, the mechanisms through which LINC00473 regulates the radiosensitivity of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells remains elusive. In the present study, reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR was used to quantify the expression of LINC00473, microRNA (miRNA/miR)‑497‑5p and cell division cycle 25A (CDC25A) in ESCC tissues. The association between LINC00473 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with ESCC was also assessed. Furthermore, Cell Counting kit‑8 and colony formation assays were carried out to monitor the proliferation of ESCC cells exposed to X‑ray radiation. A dual‑luciferase reporter assay was also conducted to analyze the interaction between LINC00473 and miR‑497‑5p, as well as the interaction between CDC25A and miR‑497‑5p. The findings of the present study demonstrated that in ESCC tissues and cells, the expression levels of LINC00473 and CDC25A were significantly upregulated, while the expression of miR‑497‑5p was downregulated. The high expression level of LINC00473 was associated with a higher T stage, lymph node metastasis stage and a lower tumor differentiation grade in patients with ESCC. Following irradiation, transfection with miR‑497‑5p mimics reduced the promoting effect of LINC00473 overexpression on ESCC cell proliferation, and partially impeded the resistance of ESCC cells to X‑ray radiation induced by LINC00473 overexpression. Moreover, transfection with miR‑497‑5p inhibitors partially alleviated the inhibitory effects of LINC00473 knockdown on cellular proliferation, and partly reversed the sensitivity of cells to X‑ray irradiation induced by LINC00473 knockdown. Furthermore, it was confirmed that miR‑497‑5p was able to bind LINC00473 and the 3'‑untranslated region of CDC25A. On the whole, the findings of the present study demonstrate that LINC00473 reduces the radiosensitivity of ESCC cells by modulating the miR‑497‑5p/CDC25A axis.",

        "# Title: LNC473 Regulating APAF1 IRES-Dependent Translation via Competitive Sponging miR574 and miR15b: Implications in Colorectal Cancer.\n# Abstract: A growing number of studies have focused on the involvement of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in the internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated translation in tumorigenesis; however, the underlying mechanisms in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain elusive. In this study, we show that LINC00473 (LNC473) exerted its functions as a tumor suppressor in promoting apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF1) IRES activity through competitively sponging miR574-5p and miR15b-5p in CRC initiation and pathogenesis. Specifically, LNC473 and its downstream target APAF1 were significantly downregulated accompanied by upregulated miR574-5p and miR15b-5p in CRC cells and tissues, which had a significant prognostic impact on clinical outcomes in our CRC cohort (n = 157). Furthermore, ectopic LNC473 significantly sponged endogenous miR574-5p or miR15b-5p and thereby inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation capacity, and it accelerated cell apoptosis through activating the APAF1-CASP9-CASP3 pathway. Notably, LNC473 overexpression resulted in dramatic promotion of APAF1 IRES activity and translation, whereas rescue experiments confirmed the recovery by the existence of LNC473 and miR574/15b-5p. Mechanistically, LNC473 overexpression promoted IRES binding domain exposure and removed the constraints controlling from miR574-5p and miR15b-5p, and subsequently enhanced IRES-mediated APAF1 expression in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, our results uncover a novel LNC473-miR574/miR15b-APAF1 signaling axis, which provides new targets and crosstalk regulation mechanism for CRC prevention and treatment.",
        "# Title: Knockdown of LINC00473 promotes radiosensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer cells via sponging miR-513a-3p.\n# Abstract: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung cancer. Radioresistance is a significant obstacle in NSCLC radiotherapy. Long non-coding RNA LINC00473 has been found to impact the radiotherapy in several malignant tumours. This study aimed to investigate the underlying role and mechanism of LINC00473 in regulating radiosensitivity of NSCLC cells. The levels of LINC00473 and miR-513a-3p were measured by quantitative Real-Time PCR. The relationship of LINC00473 with overall survival was tested by the Kaplan-Meier method. The effects of LINC00473 on cell viability and cell survival were assessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony survival assay in NSCLC cells exposed to different doses of radiation. A luciferase reporter assay was used to investigate the correlation between LINC00473 and miR-513a-3p. The present study showed that the relative LINC00473 expression was upregulated and miR-513a-3p expression was downregulated in radioresistant NSCLC patients compared with radiosensitive patients. And upregulated LINC00473 expression was associated with poor prognosis of NSCLC patients after radiotherapy. Radiation led to an increase in LINC00473 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The knockdown of LINC00473 markedly promoted radiosensitivity in NSCLC cells under different doses of radiation. LINC00473 was a sponge of miR-513a-3p and negatively regulated the miR-513a-3p expression. In conclusion, the inhibition of miR-513a-3p markedly reversed the promoted effect of LINC00473 knockdown on cell radiosensitivity. LINC00473 inhibition enhances radiosensitivity of NSCLC by sponging miR-513a-3p, providing a promising therapeutic target to increase the sensitivity of radiotherapy in NSCLC patients.",
        "# Title: lncRNA LINC00473 promotes proliferation, migration, invasion and inhibition of apoptosis of non-small cell lung cancer cells by acting as a sponge of miR-497-5p.\n# Abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-associated death worldwide and exhibits a poor prognosis. The present study aimed to determine the effect of long non-coding (lnc)RNA-LINC00473 on the development of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells by regulating the expression of microRNA (miR)-497-5p. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was conducted to detect the level of LINC00473 and miR-497-5p. An MTT assay, flow cytometry and Transwell tests were performed to evaluate the proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells. Western blotting was performed to detect the expression of apoptosis- and migration-related proteins. RNA immunoprecipitation and a luciferase reporter assay were performed to verify the regulatory relationship between lncRNA-LINC00473 and miR-497-5p. LINC00473 expression was upregulated in lung cancer tissues and NSCLC cells (A549 and H1299) when compared with adjacent tissues or human bronchial epithelial cell lines and the 5-year survival rate was lower in patients with high LINC00473 expression compared with in patients with low LINC00473 expression. A negative correlation between LINC00473 and miR-497-5p was observed in lung cancer tissues. Proliferation, migration and invasion as well as the related protein levels were increased in A549 and H1299 transfected with pcDNA3.1-LINC00473, while the opposite results were obtained in A549 and H1299 transfected with small interfering (si)-LINC00473. Notably, it was demonstrated that LINC00473 could bind directly with miR-497-5p and inhibit its expression. miR-497-5p inhibitors reversed the effect of si-LINC00473. Furthermore, the present study demonstrated that LINC00473 promoted the malignant behaviour of NSCLC cells via regulating the ERK/p38 and MAPK signalling pathways and the expression of miR-497-5p.",

Increasing evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) play a pivotal role in various cancers recently. Our present study focused on exploring the function of long intergenic non-coding RNA 00473 (LINC00473) in GC. In this study, we found that LINC00473 expression was aberrantly increased in tumor tissues compared with the paired para-cancerous tissues. The expression of high LINC00473 in GC was notably correlated with a higher risk of lymphatic metastasis, a higher incidence of vascular cancer embolus, and advanced TNM stage. Further experiments showed that the overexpression of LINC00473 could promote the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells both in vitro and in vivo. The apoptosis of GC cells increased significantly by the decrease of LINC00473. Mechanistically, LINC00473 could sponge miR-16-5p in the cytoplasm and relieve its suppression of CCND2. Moreover, AQP3 was found to be a significant downstream target gene for LINC00473 through RNA transcriptome sequencing, as demonstrated by qRT-PCR and western blot. Overexpression of LINC00473 can partially reverse the effects of AQP3 decrease on GC proliferation and metastasis. LINC00473 regulated AQP3 expression through CREB was confirmed by western blot. Our research indicates that LINC00473/miR-16-5p/CCND2 axis plays a role in the proliferation of GC and modulates AQP3 to influence GC cell metastasis, making it a potential therapeutic target for GC."

Our previous study identified an NF-KappaB interacting lncRNA (NKILA) which was negatively correlated with breast cancer metastasis and patient prognosis. However, its clinical significance and potential role in Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) remain unclear. Here we show that NKILA is down-regulated in TSCC cancer tissues than that in matched adjacent noncancerous tissues. And low NKILA expression in TSCC is significantly correlated with tumor metastasis and poor patient prognosis. In vitro, overexpression of NKILA decreases TSCC cells migration and invasion. Mechanistic study shows that NKILA inhibits the phosphorylation of IκBα and NF-κB activation as well as the induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Ectopic expression of NKILA in Tscca cells inhibits NF-κB activator TNF-α-promoted cell migration and invasion, while applying NF-κB inhibitor Bay-117082 or JSH-23 in NKILA silenced CAL27 cells reverses cell migration capacity to lower level. In vivo experimental metastasis model also demonstrates NKILA inhibits lung metastasis of NOD/SCID mice with TSCC tumors. These results suggested that NKILA is a vital determinant of TSCC migration and invasion and NF-κB signaling pathway mediates this effect. Given the above mentioned function of NKILA, it could act as a potential predictor for overall survival in patients with TSCC and a potential therapeutic target for TSCC intervention.",

In this study, we showed that NKILA was downregulated in ESCC tissues and cancer cells compared with their normal counterparts. Low NKILA expression correlated with large tumor size and advanced TNM stage, and predicted poor overall and disease-free survival of ESCC patients. Further loss- and gain-of-function assays indicated that NKILA inhibited proliferation and migration of ESCC cells in vitro, suppressed tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, NKILA could inhibit phosphorylation of IκBα, suppress p65 nuclear translocation and downregulate the expression of NF-κB target genes in ESCC cells. These results suggest NKILA could suppress malignant development of ESCC via abrogation of the NF-κB signaling and may potentially serve as a prognostic marker for ESCC.",

Baicalein, a principle flavonoid, has shown attractive anti-cancer effects on HCC. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and influencing factors contributing to the anti-cancer effects of baicalein on HCC are still largely unknown. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been revealed to be fascinating therapeutic targets for cancers. The roles of NF-κB Interacting LncRNA (NKILA) are recently explored in several cancers. However, the expressions, clinical significances, roles and action mechanisms of NKILA in the anti-cancer effects of baicalein on HCC are unknown. In this study, we found that NKILA is down-regulated in HCC and reduced expression of NKILA indicts poor survival of HCC patients. Functional assays showed that overexpression of NKILA enhances the roles of baicalein on HCC cell proliferation inhibition, apoptosis induction, and migration inhibition in vitro and tumor growth suppression in vivo. Conversely, knockdown of NKILA suppresses the effects of baicalein. Mechanistically, we found that NKILA inhibits IκBα phosphorylation, NF-κB nuclear translocation, and NF-κB activity. NKILA also enhances the inhibitory effects of baicalein on NF-κB signaling. Furthermore, the effects of NKILA on baicalein-induced NF-κB activity inhibition, cell growth inhibition, apoptosis induction, and migration inhibition are reversed by NF-κB nuclear translocation inhibitor JSH-23. Collectively, our data demonstrated that NKILA enhances the anti-cancer effects of baicalein on HCC in vitro and in vivo via the regulation of NF-κB signaling, and implied that the combination of NKILA and baicalein would be potential therapeutic strategies for HCC.",

NF-κB interacting lncRNA (NKILA) has been reported to serve as a tumor suppressor in several cancers through combining with NF-κB: IκB complex thereby inhibiting NF-κB activation. Herein, we demonstrated a low NKILA expression in laryngeal cancer and its correlation with shorter overall survival in patients with laryngeal cancer. NKILA serves as a tumor suppressor in laryngeal cancer by suppressing laryngeal cancer cell viability and migration, whereas promoting cell apoptosis; NKILA knockdown reverses the cytotoxicity of X-ray radiation on laryngeal cancer cells through combining with NF-κB: IκB complex to inhibit IκB phosphorylation, inhibit p65 nuclear translocation, and finally inhibit NF-κB activation. NF-κB binds to the promoter region of NKILA to activate its transcriptional activity, upregulated NKILA then inhibits IκB phosphorylation and NF-κB activation, thus forming a negative feedback loop to sensitize laryngeal cancer cell to X-ray radiation. In conclusion, NKILA can serve as a promising agent of enhancing the cytotoxicity of X-ray radiation on laryngeal cancer and addressing the radioresistance of laryngeal cancer.",

The association between NKILA expression and clinical variables including prognosis was estimated in rectal cancer patients. The gain-of-function study of NKILA in rectal cancer cell was conducted to evaluate the effect of NKILA on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and NF-κB signaling pathway. The results suggested NKILA expression was decreased in rectal cancer tissues and cells, and correlated with clinical stage, T classification, N classification and M classification. NKILA low-expression was an independent poor prognostic factor in rectal cancer patients. NKILA-inhibited rectal cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via suppressing NF-κB signaling. In conclusion, NKILA serves as an antioncogenic lncRNA in rectal cancer.",

        "# Title: Long non-coding RNA NKILA serves as a biomarker in the early diagnosis and prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer.\n# Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. The prognosis of patients with CRC at an advanced stage is poor. Biomarkers currently used in clinical practice, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen (CA) 19-9, lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity for early diagnosis and prediction, therefore there remains a requirement to improve the prognosis of patients with CRC. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been revealed to serve fundamental roles in various pathophysiological processes, including cancer initiation and progression. The present study investigated the expression and clinical significance of the lncRNA nuclear factor-κB interacting long non-coding RNA (NKILA) in CRC. It was identified that NKILA was downregulated in six CRC cell lines and tissues (n=173). Low NKILA expression was significantly associated with a poor differentiation grade, larger tumor size and advanced Tumor-Node-Metastases stages. Further statistical analyses revealed that low NKILA expression predicted poor overall survival (OS) rate and progression-free survival (PFS) rate. In addition, low NKILA expression was determined as an independent risk factor for poor OS and PFS. Furthermore, NKILA exhibited a relatively high sensitivity and specificity compared with CEA and CA19-9 in the early diagnosis of CRC. The serum level of NKILA was positively correlated with the level in tissues. In addition, a decreased NKILA level in serum was revealed to be partially restored post-operatively. In conclusion, low NKILA expression has been demonstrated to accelerate CRC progression and NKILA may be a potential novel biomarker in early diagnosis and prognosis of patients with CRC.",
        "# Title: NKILA, a prognostic indicator, inhibits tumor metastasis by suppressing NF-κB/Slug mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition in hepatocellular carcinoma.\n# Abstract: The metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the major obstacles hindering its therapeutic efficacy, leading to low surgical resection rate, high mortality and poor prognosis. Accumulating evidence has shown that both long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and NF-κB play vital roles in the regulation of cancer metastasis. However, the clinical significance and biological function of NKILA (NF-κB interacting lncRNA) and its interaction with NF-κB in HCC remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that NKILA was down-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines, and decreased NKILA expression was significantly associated with larger tumor size and positive vascular invasion in HCC patients. NKILA reduction was an independent risk factor of HCC patients' poor prognosis, and the 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of patients with low and high NKILA expression were 15.6% and 60.0%, respectively. Moreover, NKILA inhibits migration and invasion of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, NKILA prevents Slug/epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway via suppressing phosphorylation of IκBα, p65 nuclear translocation and NF-κB activation. In conclusion, these results indicate that NKILA might serve as an effective prognostic biomarker and a promising therapeutic target against HCC metastasis."

In a randomized, open-label, 52-week study of non-splenectomized ITP patients treated with romiplostim or medical standard of care (SOC), patients completed the 10-scale ITP-patient assessment questionnaire (PAQ) at the start of the study and after 12, 24, 36, 48,and 52 weeks of treatment. HRQOL changes were examined for all patients in both treatment groups and by responder status, splenectomy status, and after the use of rituximab. Patients in both groups showed marked increases in all HRQOL scales over 52 weeks of treatment.These change scores exceeded the minimally important difference values (a measure of clinical relevance) for most of these scales,especially in responders to treatment. Compared with baseline,patients receiving romiplostim showed statistically significant improvements compared to SOC over 52 weeks for the ITP-PAQ scales of Symptoms, Bother, Activity, Psychological Health, Fear, Overall QOL,and Social QOL.

Levels of chemokines were measured by cytometric bead array. Levels of CXCL8, CXCL9 and CXCL10 were higher in ATB patients compared to HC, but they decreased in TTB. Levels of CCL2 and CCL5 in ATB patients were similar to those observed in HC.

LTBI is detected using interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) or the tuberculin-skin-test (TST). In clinical practice, IGRAs and the TSTs have failed to distinguish between active tuberculosis and LTBI and their predictive value to identify individuals at risk for the future development of tuberculosis is limited. There is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that improve the clinical performance of current immunodiagnostic methods for tuberculosis prevention, diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Here, we review the landscape of potential alternative biomarkers useful for detection of infection with M. tuberculosis. We describe what individual markers add in terms of specificity for active/latent infection, prediction of progression to active tuberculosis and immunodiagnostic potential in high-risk groups' such as HIV-infected individuals and children.",
        "# Title: Diagnostic performance of a cytokine and IFN-γ-induced chemokine mRNA assay after Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigen stimulation in whole blood from infected individuals.\n# Abstract: Interferon (IFN)-γ release assays have limited sensitivity and cannot differentiate between active tuberculosis (TB) disease and latent TB infection (LTBI). Numerous cytokines and regulator factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis and control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Additional cytokines and chemokines associated with M. tuberculosis infection may improve the performance of IFN-γ release assays. We developed a real-time RT-PCR TaqMan assay for targeting levels of eight human targets [IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-10, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11] and evaluated the assay with three different study groups. Results showed that the sensitivity of TNF-α, IL-2R, and CXCL10 in the active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) group was 96.43%, 96.43%, and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity of IL-2R and CXCL10 in the latent tuberculosis infection group was 86.36% and 81.82%, respectively. Statistical results showed that TNF-α and CXCL9 were the best individual markers for differentiating between the PTB, LTBI, and non-TB groups. For optimal sensitivity and differentiation of M. tuberculosis infection status, the simultaneous detection of multiple targets was attempted. The combination of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2R, and the combination of TNF-α, IL-2R, CXCL9, and CXCL10 showed the best performance for detecting active PTB (both 100% positivity) and LTBI (86.36% and 81.82% positivity, respectively). These results imply that the combination of suitable markers is useful in efficiently diagnosing TB and differentiating M. tuberculosis infection status.",

Fifty-five individuals that presented with signs and symptoms requiring investigation for tuberculosis disease were prospectively recruited prior to clinical diagnosis, at a health centre in Cape Town, South Africa. Patients were later classified as having tuberculosis disease or other respiratory diseases (ORD) using a combination of clinical, radiological and laboratory findings. Out of 74 host markers that were evaluated in plasma samples from study participants using a multiplex platform, 18 showed potential as tuberculosis diagnostic candidates with the most promising being NCAM, CRP, SAP, IP-10, ferritin, TPA, I-309, and MIG, which diagnosed tuberculosis disease individually, with area under the ROC curve ≥0.80. Six-marker biosignatures containing NCAM diagnosed tuberculosis disease with a sensitivity of 100% (95%CI, 86.3-100%) and specificity of 89.3% (95%CI, 67.6-97.3%) irrespective of HIV status, and 100% accuracy in the absence of HIV infection.

Seventy-nine individuals, 27 active TB, 32 latent infection subsets, 20 individuals derivative purified protein (PPD) negative (subjects that do not have any indurative cutaneous reaction after 72 hrs of intradermal injection of PPD) and with other pulmonary disease were retrospectively studied. Forty-eight analytes were evaluated by Luminex Assay in plasma obtained from whole blood stimulated cells. The diagnostic accuracies of the markers detected were evaluated by ROC curve analysis and by the combination of multiple biomarkers to improve the potential to discriminate between infection/disease and non infection. Among 48 cytokines, 13 analytes, namely IL-3, IL-12-p40, LIF, IFNα2, IL-2ra, IL-13, b-NGF, SCF, TNF-β, TRAIL, IL-2, IFN-γ, IP-10, and MIG, were significantly higher in the active TB and LTBI groups, compared to NON-TB patients, while MIF was significantly lower in active TB patients compared to NON-TB and LTBI groups. The diagnostic accuracies of the markers detected in the culture supernatants evaluated by ROC curve analysis revealed that 11 analytes (IL2, IP10, IFN-γ, IL13, MIG, SCF, b-NGF, IL12-p40, TRAIL, IL2 Ra, LIF) discriminated between NON-TB and LTBI groups, with AUC for all analytes ≥0.73, while 14 analytes (IL2, IP10, IFN-γ, MIG, SCF, b-NGF, IL12-p40, TRAIL, IL2Ra, MIF, TNF-β, IL3, IFN-α2, LIF) discriminated between NON-TB and active TB groups, with AUC ≥0.78, that is a moderate, value in terms of accuracy of a diagnostic test. Finally, the combinations of seven biomarkers resulted in the accurate prediction of 88.89% of active TB patients, 82.35% of subjects with latent infection and 90% of non-TB patients, respectively.

Sequence-influenced methylations were described in T2DM-associated genomic regions, but evidence for direct, sequence-independent association with disease risk is missing. Here, we explore disease-contributing DNA methylation through a stepwise study design: first, a pool-based, genome-scale screen among 1169 case and control individuals revealed an excess of differentially methylated sites in genomic regions that were previously associated with T2DM through genetic studies. Next, in-depth analyses were performed at selected top-ranking regions. A CpG site in the first intron of the FTO gene showed small (3.35%) but significant (P = 0.000021) hypomethylation of cases relative to controls. The effect was independent of the sequence polymorphism in the region and persists among individuals carrying the sequence-risk alleles. The odds of belonging to the T2DM group increased by 6.1% for every 1% decrease in methylation (OR = 1.061, 95% CI: 1.032-1.090), the odds ratio for decrease of 1 standard deviation of methylation (adjusted to gender) was 1.5856 (95% CI: 1.2824-1.9606) and the sensitivity (area under the curve = 0.638, 95% CI: 0.586-0.690; males = 0.675, females = 0.609) was better than that of the strongest known sequence variant. Furthermore, a prospective study in an independent population cohort revealed significant hypomethylation of young individuals that later progressed to T2DM, relative to the individuals who stayed healthy. Further genomic analysis revealed co-localization with gene enhancers and with binding sites for methylation-sensitive transcriptional regulators. The data showed that low methylation level at the analyzed sites is an early marker of T2DM and suggests a novel mechanism by which early-onset, inter-individual methylation variation at isolated non-promoter genomic sites predisposes to T2DM.",

Epigenetic changes may provide the link for translating environmental exposures into pathological mechanisms. In this study, we performed the first comprehensive DNA methylation profiling in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We uncovered 276 CpG loci affiliated to promoters of 254 genes displaying significant differential DNA methylation in diabetic islets. These methylation changes were not present in blood cells from T2D individuals nor were they experimentally induced in non-diabetic islets by exposure to high glucose. For a subgroup of the differentially methylated genes, concordant transcriptional changes were present. Functional annotation of the aberrantly methylated genes and RNAi experiments highlighted pathways implicated in β-cell survival and function; some are implicated in cellular dysfunction while others facilitate adaptation to stressors. Together, our findings offer new insights into the intricate mechanisms of T2D pathogenesis, underscore the important involvement of epigenetic dysregulation in diabetic islets and may advance our understanding of T2D aetiology.",

Epigenetics may affect disease susceptibility. To describe the human methylome in pancreatic islets and determine the epigenetic basis of T2D, we analyzed DNA methylation of 479,927 CpG sites and the transcriptome in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We provide a detailed map of the global DNA methylation pattern in human islets, β- and α-cells. Genomic regions close to the transcription start site showed low degrees of methylation and regions further away from the transcription start site such as the gene body, 3'UTR and intergenic regions showed a higher degree of methylation. While CpG islands were hypomethylated, the surrounding 2 kb shores showed an intermediate degree of methylation, whereas regions further away (shelves and open sea) were hypermethylated in human islets, β- and α-cells. We identified 1,649 CpG sites and 853 genes, including TCF7L2, FTO and KCNQ1, with differential DNA methylation in T2D islets after correction for multiple testing. The majority of the differentially methylated CpG sites had an intermediate degree of methylation and were underrepresented in CpG islands (∼ 7%) and overrepresented in the open sea (∼ 60%). 102 of the differentially methylated genes, including CDKN1A, PDE7B, SEPT9 and EXOC3L2, were differentially expressed in T2D islets. Methylation of CDKN1A and PDE7B promoters in vitro suppressed their transcriptional activity. Functional analyses demonstrated that identified candidate genes affect pancreatic β- and α-cells as Exoc3l silencing reduced exocytosis and overexpression of Cdkn1a, Pde7b and Sept9 perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion in clonal β- and α-cells, respectively. Together, our data can serve as a reference methylome in human islets. We provide new target genes with altered DNA methylation and expression in human T2D islets that contribute to perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion. These results highlight the importance of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of T2D.",
        "# Title: Altered DNA methylation and differential expression of genes influencing metabolism and inflammation in adipose tissue from subjects with type 2 diabetes.\n# Abstract: Genetics, epigenetics, and environment may together affect the susceptibility for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our aim was to dissect molecular mechanisms underlying T2D using genome-wide expression and DNA methylation data in adipose tissue from monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D and independent case-control cohorts. In adipose tissue from diabetic twins, we found decreased expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation; carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism; and increased expression of genes involved in inflammation and glycan degradation. The most differentially expressed genes included ELOVL6, GYS2, FADS1, SPP1 (OPN), CCL18, and IL1RN. We replicated these results in adipose tissue from an independent case-control cohort. Several candidate genes for obesity and T2D (e.g., IRS1 and VEGFA) were differentially expressed in discordant twins. We found a heritable contribution to the genome-wide DNA methylation variability in twins. Differences in methylation between monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D were subsequently modest. However, 15,627 sites, representing 7,046 genes including PPARG, KCNQ1, TCF7L2, and IRS1, showed differential DNA methylation in adipose tissue from unrelated subjects with T2D compared with control subjects. A total of 1,410 of these sites also showed differential DNA methylation in the twins discordant for T2D. For the differentially methylated sites, the heritability estimate was 0.28. We also identified copy number variants (CNVs) in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D. Taken together, subjects with T2D exhibit multiple transcriptional and epigenetic changes in adipose tissue relevant to the development of the disease.",
        "# Title: An integrated epigenomic analysis for type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci in monozygotic twins.\n# Abstract: DNA methylation has a great potential for understanding the aetiology of common complex traits such as Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here we perform genome-wide methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) in whole-blood-derived DNA from 27 monozygotic twin pairs and follow up results with replication and integrated omics analyses. We identify predominately hypermethylated T2D-related differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and replicate the top signals in 42 unrelated T2D cases and 221 controls. The strongest signal is in the promoter of the MALT1 gene, involved in insulin and glycaemic pathways, and related to taurocholate levels in blood. Integrating the DNA methylome findings with T2D GWAS meta-analysis results reveals a strong enrichment for DMRs in T2D-susceptibility loci. We also detect signals specific to T2D-discordant twins in the GPR61 and PRKCB genes. These replicated T2D associations reflect both likely causal and consequential pathways of the disease. The analysis indicates how an integrated genomics and epigenomics approach, utilizing an MZ twin design, can provide pathogenic insights as well as potential drug targets and biomarkers for T2D and other complex traits.",

        "# Title: Novel epigenetic determinants of type 2 diabetes in Mexican-American families.\n# Abstract: Although DNA methylation is now recognized as an important mediator of complex diseases, the extent to which the genetic basis of such diseases is accounted for by DNA methylation is unknown. In the setting of large, extended families representing a minority, high-risk population of the USA, we aimed to characterize the role of epigenome-wide DNA methylation in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Using Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays, we tested for association of DNA methylation at 446 356 sites with age, sex and phenotypic traits related to T2D in 850 pedigreed Mexican-American individuals. Robust statistical analyses showed that (i) 15% of the methylome is significantly heritable, with a median heritability of 0.14; (ii) DNA methylation at 14% of CpG sites is associated with nearby sequence variants; (iii) 22% and 3% of the autosomal CpG sites are associated with age and sex, respectively; (iv) 53 CpG sites were significantly associated with liability to T2D, fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance; (v) DNA methylation levels at five CpG sites, mapping to three well-characterized genes (TXNIP, ABCG1 and SAMD12) independently explained 7.8% of the heritability of T2D (vi) methylation at these five sites was unlikely to be influenced by neighboring DNA sequence variation. Our study has identified novel epigenetic indicators of T2D risk in Mexican Americans who have increased risk for this disease. These results provide new insights into potential treatment targets of T2D.",

        "# Title: Epigenome-wide association study identifies TXNIP gene associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and sustained hyperglycemia.\n# Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is an established risk factor for a wide range of vascular diseases, including ischemic stroke (IS). Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a marker for average blood glucose levels over the previous 12 weeks, is used as a measure of glycemic control and also as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes (HbA1c levels ≥ 6.5%). Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, may be associated with aging processes and with modulation of the risk of various pathologies, such as DM. Specifically, DNA methylation could be one of the mechanisms mediating the relation between DM and environmental exposures. Our goal was to identify new CpG methylation sites associated with DM. We performed a genome-wide methylation study in whole-blood DNA from an IS patient cohorts. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array was used to measure DNA methylation in CpG sites. All statistical analyses were adjusted for sex, age, hyperlipidemia, body mass index (BMI), smoking habit and cell count. Findings were replicated in two independent cohorts, an IS cohort and a population-based cohort, using the same array. In the discovery phase (N = 355), we identified a CpG site, cg19693031 (located in the TXNIP gene) that was associated with DM (P = 1.17 × 10(-12)); this CpG was replicated in two independent cohorts (N = 167 and N = 645). Methylation of TXNIP was inversely and intensely associated with HbA1c levels (P = 7.3 × 10(-16)), specifically related to diabetic patients with poor control of glucose levels. We identified an association between the TXNIP gene and DM through epigenetic mechanisms, related to sustained hyperglycemia levels (HbA1c ≥ 7%).",

Here we examine whether age-related epigenetic changes affect human islet function and if blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect these changes and associate with future T2D. We analyse DNA methylation genome-wide in islets from 87 non-diabetic donors, aged 26-74 years. Aging associates with increased DNA methylation of 241 sites. These sites cover loci previously associated with T2D, for example, KLF14. Blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related methylation changes in 83 genes identified in human islets (for example, KLF14, FHL2, ZNF518B and FAM123C) and some associate with insulin secretion and T2D. DNA methylation correlates with islet expression of multiple genes, including FHL2, ZNF518B, GNPNAT1 and HLTF. Silencing these genes in β-cells alter insulin secretion. Together, we demonstrate that blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related DNA methylation changes in human islets, and associate with insulin secretion in vivo and T2D.",

To conduct a genome-wide DNA methylation in individuals with type 2 diabetes, individuals with prediabetes, and control mixed ancestry individuals from South Africa. Methods. We used peripheral blood to perform genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in 3 individuals with screen detected diabetes, 3 individuals with prediabetes, and 3 individuals with normoglycaemia from the Bellville South Community, Cape Town, South Africa, who were age-, gender-, body mass index-, and duration of residency-matched. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) was performed by Arraystar Inc. (Rockville, MD, USA). Results. Hypermethylated DMRs were 1160 (81.97%) and 124 (43.20%), respectively, in individuals with diabetes and prediabetes when both were compared to subjects with normoglycaemia. Our data shows that genes related to the immune system, signal transduction, glucose transport, and pancreas development have altered DNA methylation in subjects with prediabetes and diabetes. Pathway analysis based on the functional analysis mapping of genes to KEGG pathways suggested that the linoleic acid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism pathways are hypomethylated in prediabetes and diabetes. Conclusions. Our study suggests that epigenetic changes are likely to be an early process that occurs before the onset of overt diabetes. Detailed analysis of DMRs that shows gradual methylation differences from control versus prediabetes to prediabetes versus diabetes in a larger sample size is required to confirm these findings.",
        "# Title: Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing of Human Pancreatic Islets Reveals Novel Differentially Methylated Regions in Type 2 Diabetes Pathogenesis.\n# Abstract: Current knowledge about the role of epigenetics in type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains limited. Only a few studies have investigated DNA methylation of selected candidate genes or a very small fraction of genomic CpG sites in human pancreatic islets, the tissue of primary pathogenic importance for diabetes. Our aim was to characterize the whole-genome DNA methylation landscape in human pancreatic islets, to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in diabetic islets, and to investigate the function of DMRs in islet biology. Here, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, which is a comprehensive and unbiased method to study DNA methylation throughout the genome at a single nucleotide resolution, in pancreatic islets from donors with T2D and control subjects without diabetes. We identified 25,820 DMRs in islets from individuals with T2D. These DMRs cover loci with known islet function, e.g., PDX1, TCF7L2, and ADCY5 Importantly, binding sites previously identified by ChIP-seq for islet-specific transcription factors, enhancer regions, and different histone marks were enriched in the T2D-associated DMRs. We also identified 457 genes, including NR4A3, PARK2, PID1, SLC2A2, and SOCS2, that had both DMRs and significant expression changes in T2D islets. To mimic the situation in T2D islets, candidate genes were overexpressed or silenced in cultured β-cells. This resulted in impaired insulin secretion, thereby connecting differential methylation to islet dysfunction. We further explored the islet methylome and found a strong link between methylation levels and histone marks. Additionally, DNA methylation in different genomic regions and of different transcript types (i.e., protein coding, noncoding, and pseudogenes) was associated with islet expression levels. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the islet DNA methylome in individuals with and without diabetes and highlights the importance of epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets and T2D pathogenesis."

Discard rates for SCDs were ascertained. The relative risk of graft loss was similar for recipients of SCD kidneys with sCr of 1.6-2.0 and >2.0 mg/dL, compared to </=1.5 mg/dL. For ECD recipients, the relative risk of graft failure significantly increased with increasing sCr. Of potential SCDs, the adjusted risk of discard was higher with sCr >2.0 mg/dL (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 7.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.5-7.6) and 1.6-2.0 mg/dL (AOR 2.7; CI 2.5-2.9) relative to sCr </=1.5 mg/dL.

We performed a multicenter study to determine associations of AKI (increasing admission-to-terminal serum creatinine by AKI Network stages) with kidney discard, delayed graft function (DGF) and 6-month estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). In 1632 donors, kidney discard risk increased for AKI stages 1, 2 and 3 (compared to no AKI) with adjusted relative risks of 1.28 (1.08-1.52), 1.82 (1.45-2.30) and 2.74 (2.0-3.75), respectively. Adjusted relative risk for DGF also increased by donor AKI stage: 1.27 (1.09-1.49), 1.70 (1.37-2.12) and 2.25 (1.74-2.91), respectively. Six-month eGFR, however, was similar across AKI categories but was lower for recipients with DGF (48 [interquartile range: 31-61] vs. 58 [45-75] ml/min/1.73m(2) for no DGF, p < 0.001). There was significant favorable interaction between donor AKI and DGF such that 6-month eGFR was progressively better for DGF kidneys with increasing donor AKI (46 [29-60], 49 [32-64], 52 [36-59] and 58 [39-71] ml/min/1.73m(2) for no AKI, stage 1, 2 and 3, respectively; interaction p = 0.05).

There were 162 AKI donor transplant recipients (21% of deceased donor transplants): 139 in the standard criteria donor (SCD) and 23 in the expanded criteria donor (ECD) cohort. 71% of the AKI donors had stage 3 (severe AKI), based on acute kidney injury network (AKIN) staging. Protocol biopsies were done at 1, 4, and 12 months posttransplant. One and four month formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies from 48 patients (24 AKI donors, 24 non-AKI) underwent global gene expression profiling using DNA microarrays (96 arrays). DGF was more common in the AKI group but eGFR, graft survival at 1 year and proportion with IF/TA>2 at 1 year were similar for the two groups. At 1 month, there were 898 differentially expressed genes in the AKI group (p-value <0.005; FDR <10%), but by 4 months there were no differences.

To determine whether this policy is justified, we analyzed outcomes of donor kidneys with acute kidney injury (AKI) in a large UK cohort. A retrospective analysis of the UK Transplant Registry evaluated deceased donors between 2003 and 2013. Donors were classified as no AKI, or AKI stage 1-3 according to Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Relationship of AKI with delayed graft function/primary nonfunction (DGF/PNF), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and graft-survival at 90 days and 1 year was analyzed. There were 11 219 kidneys (1869 [17%] with AKI) included. Graft failure at 1 year is greater for donors with AKI than for those without (graft survival 89% vs. 91%, p = 0.02; odds ratio (OR) 1.20 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.41]). DGF rates increase with donor AKI stage (p < 0.005), and PNF rates are significantly higher for AKIN stage 3 kidneys (9% vs. 4%, p = 0.04) Analysis of association between AKI and recipient eGFR suggests a risk of inferior eGFR with AKI versus no AKI (p < 0.005; OR 1.25 [95% CI: 1.08-1.31]). We report a small reduction in 1-year graft-survival of kidneys from donors with AKI. We conclude that AKI stage 1 or 2 kidneys should be used; however, caution is advised for AKI stage 3 donors.",

We aimed to evaluate the impact of donors' AKI severity and trend on graft outcomes in DDK transplantation. This was a retrospective study of DDK transplantation performed from 2005 to 2014. Based on maximum and terminal serum creatinine values before transplantation, the AKI trends were categorized as improving or worsening. Of 413 DDKs, 275 developed AKI: 177 stage 1, 52 stage 2, and 46 stage 3. DDKs with AKI had 212 improving AKI and 63 worsening AKI. Graft outcomes were similar based on AKI stage. Worsening AKI did not affect delayed graft function development; however, it significantly elevated graft failure risk even after adjusting for AKI stage and Kidney Donor Risk Index. Graft survival of the improving group was similar to DDKs with no AKI. This study showed that AKI severity of DDKs did not affect overall graft outcomes. Notably, DDKs with improving AKI showed a similar graft survival rate to DDKs without AKI, although worsening AKI had a worse prognosis. Consideration of the AKI trend, rather than its severity, is needed when DDKs with AKI are allocated.",

We performed a multicenter study to determine associations between donor AKI (from none to severe based on AKI Network stages) and all-cause graft failure, adjusting for donor, transplant, and recipient factors. We examined whether any of the following factors modified the relationship between donor AKI and graft survival: kidney donor profile index, cold ischemia time, donation after cardiac death, expanded-criteria donation, kidney machine perfusion, donor-recipient gender combinations, or delayed graft function. We also evaluated the association between donor AKI and a 3-year composite outcome of all-cause graft failure or estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 in a subcohort of 30% of recipients. Among 2,430 kidneys transplanted from 1,298 deceased donors, 585 (24%) were from donors with AKI. Over a median follow-up of 4.0 years, there were no significant differences in graft survival by donor AKI stage. We found no evidence that pre-specified variables modified the effect of donor AKI on graft survival. In the subcohort, donor AKI was not associated with the 3-year composite outcome. Donor AKI was not associated with graft failure in this well-phenotyped cohort.

        "# Title: Success of kidney transplantations from deceased donors with acute kidney injury.\n# Abstract: BACKGROUND The acceptance of organs from deceased donors with acute kidney injury (AKI) varies considerably, with uncertain outcomes. The current organ shortage has led to increased use of marginal donor organs. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective, single-center study included 642 patients who underwent kidney allograft transplantation between 2005 and 2016. The recipients were categorized into 3 groups: AKI-1 (n=214), comprising donors with a peak serum creatinine (SCr) level of 1.1-2.0 mg/dl; AKI-2 (n=89), comprising donors with a peak SCr level >2 mg/dl; and non-AKI (n=339), comprising donors with normal kidney function (SCr <1.1 mg/dl). RESULTS The cumulative survival rates for patients and grafts did not significantly differ among the AKI-1, AKI-2, and non-AKI groups at the 1-year (91.6%/79.4%, 92.1%/83.1%, 95.3%/88.5%, respectively) and 5-year assessments (79.4%/67.8%, 86.8%/71.7%, 80.5%/71.1%, respectively). These findings were corroborated by mean SCr values and estimated glomerular filtration rates at the 1-year (2.08±1.7/51.16±23.45, 2.01±1.52/56.46±23.63, 1.81±1.13/55.44±23.26 mg/dl, respectively) and 5-year assessments (1.91±1.28/51.06±24.65, 1.74±0.66/57.44±31.21, 1.7±0.88/58.56±26.04 mg/dl, respectively). The incidence of delayed graft function in each group was 29.9%, 44.9%, and 28.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Kidney transplantation from donors with AKI, although associated with a higher rate of delayed graft function, results in good long-term transplant survival and reliable kidney functionality after 5 years. The inclusion of donors with AKI may widely extend the pool of available organs; however, careful donor selection is necessary.",

We investigated the effect of donor AKI on renal function and chronic changes on protocol biopsies at 1-year post-transplant. Donor AKI was defined according to Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Between 2013 and 2017, 333 kidneys were transplanted and subsequently biopsied after 1 year. Fifty-three kidneys from AKI donors (AKIN stage I n = 42, stage II n = 8, stage III n = 3) were compared to 280 kidneys from non-AKI donors. At 1-year follow-up, patient and graft survival were comparable. Donor AKI was not predictive of IFTA (Banff interstitial fibrosis plus tubular atrophy scores) at 1-year post-transplant biopsy (2.10 ± 1.28 in AKI, 2.09 ± 1.22 in non-AKI, P = .95). Donor AKI was also not associated with progression of IFTA from 3 to 12 months (P = .69), or inferior glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, P = .94). In a multivariate analysis, the odds of IFTA >2 were comparable between AKI and non-AKI groups. In conclusion, the transplantation of kidneys from donors with predominantly stage I AKI results in comparable function and degree of fibrosis on protocol biopsies 1-year post-transplant. Selected grafts from donors with AKI are a valuable tool for expanding the donor pool for kidney transplantation.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate how kidney transplantation (KT) from a donor with AKI affects long-term graft survival in various situations. All patients who underwent KT from DBD donors between June 2003 and April 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. The KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) criteria were used to classify donor AKI. The cohort included 376 donors (no AKI group, n = 117 [31.1%]; AKI group n = 259 [68.9%]). Death-censored graft survival was similar according to the presence of AKI, AKI severity, and the AKI trend (p = 0.929, p = 0.077, and p = 0.658, respectively). Patients whose donors had AKI who received using low dose (1.5 mg/kg for three days) rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (r-ATG) as the induction agent had significantly superior death-censored graft survival compared with patients in that group who received basiliximab (p = 0.039). AKI in DBD donors did not affect long-term death-censored graft survival. Low-dose r-ATG may be considered as an induction immunosuppression in recipients receiving kidneys with AKI because it showed better graft survival than basiliximab.",

        "# Title: Outcomes and factors leading to graft failure in kidney transplants from deceased donors with acute kidney injury-A retrospective cohort study.\n# Abstract: Due to shortage of donor, kidney transplants (KTs) from donors with acute kidney injury (AKI) are expanding. Although previous studies comparing clinical outcomes between AKI and non-AKI donors in KTs have shown comparable results, data on high-volume analysis of KTs outcomes with AKI donors are limited. This study aimed to analyze the selection trends of AKI donors and investigate the impact of AKI on graft failure using the United states cohort data. We analyzed a total 52,757 KTs collected in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipient (SRTR) from 2010 to 2015. The sample included 4,962 (9.4%) cases of KTs with AKI donors (creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dL). Clinical characteristics of AKI and non-AKI donors were analyzed and outcomes of both groups were compared. We also analyzed risk factors for graft failure in AKI donor KTs. Although the incidence of delayed graft function was higher in recipients of AKI donors compared to non-AKI donors, graft and patient survival were not significantly different between the two groups. We found donor hypertension, cold ischemic time, the proportion of African American donors, and high KDPI were risk factors for graft failure in AKI donor KTs. KTs from deceased donor with AKI showed comparable outcomes. Thus, donors with AKI need to be considered more actively to expand donor pool. Caution is still needed when donors have additional risk factors of graft failure.",

Kidneys from ≥65-year-old donors with comorbidities are more susceptible to cold ischemia time (CIT) and DGF and it is unknown whether such elderly kidneys with AKI can also be transplanted with satisfactory outcomes. All KTs from ≥65-year-old donors performed at our center from 1999 to 2019 (n = 233) were retrospectively analyzed and short- as well as long-term outcomes were compared for KTs from donors with (n = 64) and without AKI (n = 169). There were no significant differences regarding the frequency of DGF as well as the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 1 and 3 years post-transplant between the no-AKI and the AKI group (DGF: no-AKI 30.2% vs. AKI 40.6%, P = .17; eGFR at 1-year: 31.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 vs. 35.5 ml/min/1.73 m2 , P = .32; at 3-years: 33.8 ml/min/1.73 m2 vs. 40.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 , P = .18; respectively). Death-censored graft survival and patient survival were also not significantly different.

Our approach in vaccine development uses recombinant expression of the highly immunogenic HAV antigen VP1-P2a in food-grade lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis and in Escherichia coli. We used genetic constructs that enable nisin-controlled expression of the antigen in L. lactis in three different forms: (a) intracellularly, (b) on the bacterial surface and (c) on the bacterial surface fused with the fragment of the E. coli flagellin molecule that can act as a molecular adjuvant. Expression of the two surface forms of the antigen was achieved in L. lactis, and the resulting antigen-displaying bacteria were administered orally to mice. Half the animals in each of the two groups developed specific IgGs, with titers increasing over time and reaching 1:422 without flagellin and 1:320 with flagellin. A much higher titer 1:25,803 was observed with the parenterally administered antigen, which was purified from E. coli. With the latter, a significant mucosal IgA response was also observed. Despite significant titers, the IgGs elicited with oral or parenteral administration could not prevent HAV from infecting cells in a virus neutralization assay, suggesting that the antibodies cannot recognize viral surface epitopes. Nevertheless, orally administered HAV antigen expressed in L. lactis elicited significant systemic humoral immune response showing the feasibility for development of effective HAV vaccine for mucosal delivery.",
        "# Title: Oral immunization with recombinant Lactococcus lactis delivering a multi-epitope antigen CTB-UE attenuates Helicobacter pylori infection in mice.\n# Abstract: Urease is an essential virulence factor and colonization factor for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and is considered as an excellent vaccine candidate antigen. However, conventional technologies for preparing an injectable vaccine require purification of the antigenic protein and preparation of an adjuvant. Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 (L. lactis) could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of edible vaccine. In previous study, we constructed a multi-epitope vaccine, designated CTB-UE, which is composed of the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), three Th cell epitopes and two B-cell epitopes from urease subunits. To develop a novel type of oral vaccine against H. pylori, genetically modified L. lactis strains were established to secrete this epitope vaccine extracellularly in this study. Oral prophylactic immunization with recombinant L. lactis significantly elicited humoral anti-urease antibody responses (P < 0.001) and reduced the gastric colonization of H. pylori from 7.14 ± 0.95 to 4.68 ± 0.98 log10 CFU g(-1) stomach. This L. lactis oral vaccine offers a promising vaccine candidate for the control of H. pylori infection.",
        "# Title: Development of a new DNA vaccine based on mycobacterial ESAT-6 antigen delivered by recombinant invasive Lactococcus lactis FnBPA+.\n# Abstract: The use of the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis as a vehicle for the oral delivery of DNA vaccine plasmids constitutes a promising strategy for vaccination. The delivery of DNA plasmids into eukaryotic cells is of critical importance for subsequent DNA expression and effectiveness of the vaccine. In this context, the use of the recombinant invasive L. lactis FnBPA+ (fibronectin-binding protein A) strain for the oral delivery of the eukaryotic expression vector vaccination using lactic acid bacteria (pValac), coding for the 6-kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6) gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, could represent a new DNA vaccine strategy against tuberculosis. To this end, the ESAT-6 sequence was cloned into the pValac vector; the L. lactis fibronectin-binding protein A (FnBPA)+ (pValac:ESAT-6) strain was obtained, and its immunological profile was checked in BALB/c mice. This strain was able to significantly increase interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production in spleen cells, showing a systemic T helper 1 (Th1) cell response. The mice also showed a significant increase in specific secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) production in colon tissue and fecal extracts. Thus, this is the first time that L. lactis has been used to deliver a plasmid DNA harboring a gene that encodes an antigen against tuberculosis through mucous membranes.",
        "# Title: Lactococcus lactis displayed neuraminidase confers cross protective immunity against influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Influenza A viruses pose a serious threat to public health. Current influenza A vaccines predominantly focus on hemagglutinin (HA) and show strain-specific protection. Neuraminidase (NA) is much less studied in the context of humoral immunity against influenza A viruses. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cross protective immunity of NA presented on Lactococcus lactis (L.lactis) surface against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in the mouse model. L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA was constructed in which pgsA was used as an anchor protein. Mice vaccinated orally with L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA could elicit significant NA-specific serum IgG and mucosa IgA antibodies, as well as neuraminidase inhibition (NI) titers. Importantly, L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA provided 80% protection against H5N1, 60% protection against H3N2 and H1N1, respectively. These findings suggest that recombinant L.lactis/pNZ110-pgsA-NA in the absence of adjuvant via oral administration can be served as an effective vaccine candidate against diverse strains of influenza A viruses.",
        "# Title: Broadly protective immunity against divergent influenza viruses by oral co-administration of Lactococcus lactis expressing nucleoprotein adjuvanted with cholera toxin B subunit in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines need to be annually reformulated to well match the predicated circulating strains. Thus, it is critical for developing a novel universal influenza vaccine that would be able to confer cross-protection against constantly emerging divergent influenza virus strains. Influenza virus A is a genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses. Influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) is a structural protein which encapsidates the negative strand viral RNA, and anti-NP antibodies play role in cross-protective immunity. Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) is an ideal vaccine delivery vehicle via oral administration route. However, L. lactis vectored vaccine exhibits poor immunogenicity without the use of mucosal adjuvant. To enhance the immunogenicity of L. lactis vectored vaccine, cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit, one of mucosal adjuvants, is a safe adjuvant for oral route, when combined with L. lactis vectored vaccine. In this study, we hypothesized that pNZ8008, a L. lactis expression plasmid, encoding NP antigen, would be able to elicit cross-protection with the use of CTB via oral administration route.",
        "# Title: Cross-protection of Lactococcus lactis-displayed HA2 subunit against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines provide strain-specific protection against homologous subtypes and need to be updated annually. Therefore, it is essential to develop a universal vaccine that would induce broadly cross-protective immunity against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses. The highly conserved HA2 subunit is a promising candidate for developing a universal influenza vaccine. Here, we hypothesized that the HA2 subunit could be displayed on the surface of Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis), using Spax as an anchor protein (L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2) and that L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 would have immunogenicity by oral administration without the use of adjuvant in the mouse model. To address this hypothesis, we show that oral vaccination of mice with L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 elicited significant humoral and mucosal immune responses. Importantly, L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 provided 100% protection against homologous H5N1 or heterologous H1N1 virus challenge. These results suggest that an HA2 subunit presented on the surface of L. lactis is an effective universal vaccine candidate against influenza A viruses in the poultry industry and in humans.",

Most of the current HIV vaccines under development use the i.m. route for immunization, which is relatively poor in generating potent and long-lived mucosal immune responses. In this article, we explore the ability of an oral vaccination with a probiotic organism, Lactococcus lactis, to elicit HIV-specific immune responses in the mucosal and systemic compartments of BALB/c mice. We expressed the HIV-1 Gag-p24 on the tip of the T3 pilus of Streptococcus pyogenes as a fusion to the Cpa protein (LL-Gag). After four monthly LL-Gag oral immunizations, we observed strong Gag-specific IgG and IgA responses in serum, feces, and vaginal secretions. However, the Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses in the blood were at or below our detection limit. After an i.m. modified vaccinia Ankara/Gag boost, we observed robust Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses both in systemic and in mucosal tissues, including intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes of the small intestine, Peyer's patches, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Consistent with strong immunogenicity, the LL-Gag induced activation of CD11c(+) CD11b(+) dendritic cells in the Peyer's patches after oral immunization. Our results demonstrate that oral immunization with L. lactis expressing an Ag on the tip of the group A Streptococcus pilus serves as an excellent vaccine platform to induce strong mucosal humoral and cellular immunity against HIV.",

        "# Title: Production and delivery of Helicobacter pylori NapA in Lactococcus lactis and its protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity.\n# Abstract: Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein A subunit (NapA) has been identified as a virulence factor, a protective antigen and a potent immunomodulator. NapA shows unique application potentials for anti-H. pylori vaccines and treatment strategies of certain allergic diseases and carcinomas. However, appropriate production and utilization modes of NapA still remain uncertain to date. This work has established a novel efficient production and utilization mode of NapA by using L. lactis as an expression host and delivery vector, and demonstrated immune protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity of the engineered L. lactis by oral vaccination of mice. It was observed for the first time that H. pylori NapA promotes both polarized Th17 and Th1 responses, which may greatly affect the clinical application of NapA. This report offers a promising anti-H. pylori oral vaccine candidate and a potent mucosal immune modulatory agent. Meanwhile, it uncovers a way to produce and deliver the oral vaccine and immunomodulator by fermentation of food like milk, which might have striking effects on control of H. pylori infection, gastrointestinal cancers, and Th2 bias allergic diseases, including many food allergies.",
        "# Title: Protective immunity induced by an intranasal multivalent vaccine comprising 10 Lactococcus lactis strains expressing highly prevalent M-protein antigens derived from Group A Streptococcus.\n# Abstract: Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) causes diseases ranging from mild pharyngitis to severe invasive infections. The N-terminal fragment of streptococcal M protein elicits protective antibodies and is an attractive vaccine target. However, this N- terminal fragment is hypervariable: there are more than 200 different M types. In this study, an intranasal live bacterial vaccine comprising 10 strains of Lactococcus lactis, each expressing one N-terminal fragment of M protein, has been developed. Live bacterial-vectored vaccines cost less to manufacture because the processes involved are less complex than those required for production of protein subunit vaccines. Moreover, intranasal administration does not require syringes or specialized personnel. Evaluation of individual vaccine types (M1, M2, M3, M4, M6, M9, M12, M22, M28 and M77) showed that most of them protected mice against challenge with virulent S. pyogenes. All 10 strains combined in a 10-valent vaccine (M×10) induced serum and bronchoalveolar lavage IgG titers that ranged from three- to 10-fold those of unimmunized mice. After intranasal challenge with M28 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice was significantly higher than that of unimmunized mice. In contrast, when mice were challenged with M75 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice did not differ significantly from that of unimmunized mice. Mx-10 immunized mice had significantly less S. pyogenes in oropharyngeal washes and developed less severe disease symptoms after challenge than did unimmunized mice. Our L. lactis-based vaccine may provide an alternative solution to development of broadly protective group A streptococcal vaccines.",
        "# Title: Mucosal and systemic immune responses elicited by recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a fusion protein composed of pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin from Bordetella pertussis.\n# Abstract: We constructed a food-grade expression system harboring a F1S1 fusion protein of Bordetella pertussis to be produced in Lactococcus lactis NZ3900 as a new oral vaccine model against whooping cough, caused by B. pertussis. F1S1 was composed of N-terminally truncated S1 subunit of pertussis toxin and type I immunodominant domain of filamentous hemagglutinin which are both known as protective immunogens against pertussis. The recombinant L. lactis was administered via oral or intranasal routes to BALB/c mice and the related specific systemic and mucosal immune responses were then evaluated. The results indicated significantly higher levels of specific IgA in the lung extracts and IgG in sera of mucosally-immunized mice, compared to their controls. It was revealed that higher levels of IgG2a, compared to IgG1, were produced in all mucosally-immunized mice. Moreover, immunized mice developed Th1 responses with high levels of IFN-γ production by the spleen cells. These findings provide evidence for L. lactis to be used as a suitable vehicle for expression and delivery of F1S1 fusion protein to mucosa and induction of appropriate systemic and mucosal immune responses against pertussis.",
        "# Title: Rotavirus VP6 protein mucosally delivered by cell wall-derived particles from Lactococcus lactis induces protection against infection in a murine model.\n# Abstract: Rotaviruses are the primary cause of acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide. Although the implementation of live attenuated vaccines has reduced the number of rotavirus-associated deaths, variance in their effectiveness has been reported in different countries. This fact, among other concerns, leads to continuous efforts for the development of new generation of vaccines against rotavirus.In this work, we describe the obtention of cell wall-derived particles from a recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a cell wall-anchored version of the rotavirus VP6 protein. After confirming by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, flow cytometry and electronic immunomicroscopy that these particles were carrying the VP6 protein, their immunogenic potential was evaluated in adult BALB/c mice. For that, mucosal immunizations (oral or intranasal), with or without the dmLT [(double mutant Escherichia coli heat labile toxin LT(R192G/L211A)] adjuvant were performed. The results showed that these cell wall-derived particles were able to generate anti-rotavirus IgG and IgA antibodies only when administered intranasally, whether the adjuvant was present or not. However, the presence of dmLT was necessary to confer protection against rotavirus infection, which was evidenced by a 79.5 percent viral shedding reduction.In summary, this work describes the production of cell wall-derived particles which were able to induce a protective immune response after intranasal immunization. Further studies are needed to characterize the immune response elicited by these particles as well as to determine their potential as an alternative to the use of live L. lactis for mucosal antigen delivery.",

        "# Title: A Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB)-Based Vaccine Candidate for Human Norovirus.\n# Abstract: Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are responsible for more than 95% of the non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis epidemics in the world. The CDC estimates that every year 21 million individuals suffer from HuNoV-induced gastroenteritis in the United States. Currently, there is no FDA-approved vaccine for HuNoVs. Development of an effective vaccine has been hampered by the lack of an efficient cell culture system for HuNoVs and a suitable small animal model for pathogenesis study. In this study, we developed lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as a vector to deliver HuNoV antigen. A LAB strain (Lactococcus lactis) carrying VP1 gene of a HuNoV GII.4 virus (LAB-VP1) was constructed. It was found that HuNoV VP1 protein was highly expressed by LAB vector and was secreted into media supernatants. To test whether LAB-based HuNoV vaccine candidate is immunogenic, 4-day-old gnotobiotic piglets were orally inoculated with various doses of LAB-VP1. It was found that LABs were persistent in the small intestine of piglets and shed in pig feces for at least 25 days post inoculation. LAB DNA and VP1 were detected in mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen tissue in LAB-VP1 inoculated groups. HuNoV-specific IgG and IgA were detectable in serum and feces respectively at day 13 post-inoculation, and further increased at later time points. After being challenged with HuNoV GII.4 strain, a large amount of HuNoV antigens were observed in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum sections of the intestine in the LAB control group. In contrast, significantly less, or no, HuNoV antigens were detected in the LAB-VP1 immunized groups. Collectively, these results demonstrate that a LAB-based HuNoV vaccine induces protective immunity in gnotobiotic piglets.",

        "# Title: Mucosal Vaccination with Lactococcus lactis-Secreting Surface Immunological Protein Induces Humoral and Cellular Immune Protection against Group B Streptococcus in a Murine Model.\n# Abstract: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the primary etiological agent of sepsis and meningitis in newborns and is associated with premature birth and stillbirth. The development of a licensed vaccine is one of the pending challenges for the World Health Organization. Previously, we showed that oral immunization with surface immune protein (SIP) decreases vaginal colonization of GBS and generates functional opsonizing antibodies, which was determined by opsonophagocytic assays (OPA) in vitro. We also showed that the protein has an adjuvant vaccine profile. Therefore, an oral vaccine based on SIP may be an attractive alternative to employ in the development of new vaccines against GBS. Lactococcus lactis is a highlighted oral vaccine probiotic inducer of the mucosal immune response. This bacterium could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of an edible vaccine and has been used in clinical trials. In this study, we showed that an oral vaccine with a recombinant L. lactis strain secreting SIP from GBS (rL. lactis-SIP) can induce protective humoral and cellular immunity in an experimental model of GBS vaginal colonization in C57BL/6 mice. Mice immunized with rL. lactis-SIP were protected against clinical symptoms and bacterial colonization after GBS vaginal colonization. Our rL. lactis-SIP vaccine also induces an increase of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) specifically against SIP. The adoptive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice to naïve mice generated protection against GBS vaginal colonization. Moreover, the rL. lactis-SIP strain induces the activation of SIP-specific T cells, which could decrease GBS vaginal colonization and generate protective antibodies when transferred to other mice. Our experimental observations strongly support the notion that rL. lactis-SIP induces protective humoral and cellular immunity and could be considered as a novel alternative in the development of vaccines for GBS.",
        "# Title: Recombinant Lactococcus Lactis Displaying Omp31 Antigen of Brucella melitensis Can Induce an Immunogenic Response in BALB/c Mice.\n# Abstract: Since Brucella infection mostly occurs through the mucosal surfaces, immune response induced by vaccine that is delivered by a way of mucosal route can be drastically enhanced to control the brucellosis. Omp31is the major outer membrane protein of Brucella, and is considered as a protective antigen against Brucella infection. Accordingly, Lactococcus lactis has been used as an antigen-delivering vector to develop a vaccine-induced mucosal response for having a safer vaccination against brucellosis. A designed omp31 gene fused to the usp45 signal peptide and M6 cell wall anchor was sub cloned in the pNZ7021 expression vector, and a recombinant L. lactis displaying Omp31 was constructed. Omp31 protein expression was confirmed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. Animals were orally and intraperitoneally immunized with live or killed L. lactis expressing Omp31, respectively. The humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated by measuring the specific cytokines and antibodies. sIgA, serum IgA, IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in the mice immunized with live recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31 and also serum IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in mice immunized with killed recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31. Among IgG subtypes, IgG2a response was significantly higher in both groups compared to IgG1. In mice groups immunized with recombinant L. lactis, the IFN-γ and IL-10 level elevated; however, there was no change in the level of IL-4. These results indicated that recombinants L. lactis induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, and also vaccines based on L. lactis-derived live carriers are promising interventions against Brucella melitensis infections.",
        "# Title: Lactococcus lactis FNBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) Induces Cellular and Humoral Immune Responses After Oral Immunization of Mice.\n# Abstract: The development of a new vaccine strategy against tuberculosis is urgently needed and has been greatly encouraged by the scientific community worldwide. In this work, we constructed a lactococcal DNA vaccine based on the fusion of two Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens, ESAT-6 and Ag85A, and examined its immunogenicity. The coding sequences of the ESAT-6 and Ag85A genes were fused and cloned into the eukaryotic expression pValac vector, and the functionality of the vector was confirmed in vitro. Then, L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) was obtained and used for oral immunization of mice. This strain induced significant increases in IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-17 cytokines in stimulated splenocyte cultures, and significant production of antigen-specific sIgA was observed in the colonic tissues of immunized mice. We demonstrated that L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) generated a cellular and humoral immune response after oral immunization of mice. The strategy developed in this work may represent an interesting DNA mucosal vaccine candidate against tuberculosis, using the fusion of two highly immunogenic antigens delivered by safe lactic acid bacteria.",
        "# Title: Protective Immunity Against Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli by Oral Vaccination of Engineered Lactococcus lactis.\n# Abstract: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the leading causes of diarrhea in children globally, and thus suitable vaccines are desired. Antigen display on lactic acid bacteria is a reliable approach for efficient oral vaccination and preventing bowel diseases. To develop an oral vaccine against ETEC, the gene of the binding domain from heat-labile toxin (LTB), a key ETEC virulence factor, was codon-optimized and cloned into a construct containing a signal peptide and an anchor for display on L. lactis. Bioinformatics analysis showed a codon adaptation index of 0.95 for the codon-optimized gene. Cell surface expression of LTB was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and blotting. White New Zealand rabbits were immunized per os (PO) with the recombinant L. lactis, and the antibody titers were assayed with ELISA. In vitro neutralization assay was performed using mouse adrenal tumor cells and rabbit ileal loop test was performed as the in vivo assay. ELISA results indicated that oral administration of the engineered L. lactis elicited a significant production of IgA in the intestine. In vitro neutralization assay showed that the effect of the toxin could be neutralized with 500 µg/ml of IgG isolated from the oral vaccine group. Furthermore, the dose of ETEC causing fluid accumulation in the ileal loop test showed a tenfold increase in rabbits immunized with either recombinant L. lactis or LTB protein compared to other groups. Our results imply that recombinant L. lactis could potentially be an effective live oral vaccine against ETEC toxicity.",
        "# Title: Oral Immunization of Mice with Cell Extracts from Recombinant Lactococcus lactis Expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein.\n# Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all over the world and became a pandemic that named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). At present, several intramuscular vaccines have been successfully developed and mass vaccination has progressed in many countries. The aim of the study is to develop and examine an oral vaccine against COVID-19 with recombinant Lactococcus lactis IL1403, a strain of lactic acid bacteria, expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) S1 subunit as an immunizing antigen. PBS or cell extracts from recombinant L. lactis were orally administered into mice (control VS treatment), and formation of antigen-specific antibodies and changes in the gut microbiome were analyzed. Intracellular antigen was detected, but its secretion was not successful. After immunization, antigen-specific serum IgG and fecal IgA levels were 1.5-fold (P = 0.002) and 1.4-fold (P = 0.016) higher in the immunized mice (treatment) than control, respectively. Gut microbiome profiles were clearly separated between the two groups when analyzed for beta diversity with overall similarity. At the genus level, while Coprococcus (P = 0.036) and unclassified genus of Ruminococcaceae (P = 0.037) in treatment were more abundant than control, rc4-4 (P = 0.013) and Stenotrophomonas (P = 0.021) were less abundant. Our results indicate that cell extract containing SARS-CoV-2 antigen can induce mice to produce antigen-specific antibodies without overall changes in the gut microbiome. This strategy may be useful for the development of other oral viral vaccines.",
        "# Title: Oral Immunization With a M Cell-Targeting Recombinant L. Lactis Vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE Stimulate Protective Immunity Against H. Pylori in Mice.\n# Abstract: There are many virulence factors of H. pylori that contribute in diverse ways to gastric disease. Therefore, designing multivalent epitope vaccines against many key virulence factors virulence factors of H. pylori is a promising strategy to control H. pylori infection. In previous studies, we constructed a multivalent epitope vaccine FVpE against four key virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), and oral immunization with the FVpE vaccine plus a polysaccharide adjuvant (PA) containing lycium barbarum polysaccharide and chitosan could provide protection against H. pylori infection in the Mongolian gerbil model. Oral vaccines have many advantages over injected vaccines, such as improved safety and compliance, and easier manufacturing and administration. However, the harsh gastrointestinal (GI) environment, such as gastric acid and proteolytic enzymes, limits the development of oral vaccines to some extent. Oral vaccines need a gastrointestinal delivery system with high safety, low price and promoting vaccine antigen to stimulate immune response in the gastrointestinal mucosa. Lactic acid bacteria are gastrointestinal probiotics that have unique advantages as a delivery system for oral vaccines. In this study, a M cell-targeting surface display system for L. lactis named plSAM was designed to help vaccine antigens to stimulate effective immune responses in the gastrointestinal tract, and a M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE was constructed by using the surface display system plSAM. recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE could secretively express the SAM-FVpE protein and display it on the bacterial surface. Moreover, experimental results confirmed that LL-plSAM-FVpE had an enhanced M cell-targeting property. In addition, LL-plSAM-FVpE had excellent M cell-targeting property to promote the phagocytosis and transport of the antigen SAM-FVpE by gastrointestinal M cells. More importantly, oral immunization of LL-plSAM-FVpE or SAM-FVpE plus PA can stimulate IgG and sIgA antibodies and CD4+ T cell immune responses against four virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), thus providing protective immunity against H. pylori infection in mice. The M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine against various key H. pylori virulence factors could be a promising vaccine candidate for controlling H. pylori infection.",
        "# Title: Oral and intranasal immunization with food-grade recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing high conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein triggers mice's immunity responses.\n# Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic began at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread throughout the world. Vaccination is still the most effective method of prevention of pathogenic infections, including viral infections. However, there is little evidence that vaccination can protect against SARS-CoV-2 virus for a long time. Thus, regular re-vaccination is necessary to control COVID-19. Vaccination by injection is invasive, and is one of the reasons people refuse to get re-vaccinated. Therefore, we developed a less invasive vaccine based on oral or nasal administration. The gene encoding the high conserved region (HCR) spike protein was inserted into pNZ8149 and expressed in L.lactis NZ3900. Mice were immunized at 3-week intervals with oral or nasal routes. Anti-SARS-CoV2 spike antibody (IgG and IgA) level were measured using ELISA method before and after treatment. Plasma cells population in lymph were analyzed using flowcytometry and the CD4 + and CD8 + cells in lymph and intestine were analyzed using immunofluorescence method. The results of nasal and oral administration in experimental animals showed that L.lactis carrying the HCR gene could induce a humoral immune response, as indicated by increased levels of IgG and IgA against SARS-CoV-2 (IgG/IgA-SARS-CoV-2). The plasma cell population after nasal and oral vaccination in mice were significantly different with control group (p < 0.05). The CD4 + and CD8 + cells in intestine were significantly higher in orally immunized group mice than control group. The CD8 + cells in lymph were significantly higher in intranasal immunized group mice than control group. Our data demonstrate L.lactis expressing spike protein can be developed into a less invasive alternative to nasal and oral vaccination.",
        "# Title: Expanding strain coverage of a group A Streptococcus pilus-expressing Lactococcus lactis mucosal vaccine.\n# Abstract: Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a human pathogenic bacterium that can trigger a wide range of diseases, including the autoimmune diseases acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, causing major morbidity and mortality in many low- and middle-income countries. Primary intervention programs have had limited success thus far, and a licensed vaccine has yet to be developed. The pilus of GAS is known to be involved in host cell adhesion, biofilm formation and immune evasion. We have a mucosal vaccine in development that expresses the pilus of GAS on the surface of the nonpathogenic bacterium Lactococcus lactis. To expand strain coverage, we combined seven L. lactis constructs, each expressing a different GAS pilus variant, and investigated the systemic and mucosal immune responses following immunization. Mice immunized with this combination showed specific immunoglobin G and immunoglobin A responses to the GAS pilus proteins of vaccine strains, at levels comparable to mice immunized with a single construct. Cross-reactivity to pilus proteins of nonvaccine strains was also evident. Furthermore, protective efficacy against a homologous strain of GAS in a murine nasopharyngeal colonization model was observed. Overall, this study provides further evidence for using pilus-expressing lactic acid bacteria as a vaccine to prevent upper respiratory tract GAS infections."

        "# Title: Long non-coding RNA GHET1 promotes gastric carcinoma cell proliferation by increasing c-Myc mRNA stability.\n# Abstract: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a recently characterized class of non-coding RNAs, have been shown to have important regulatory roles and are de-regulated in a variety of tumors. However, the contributions of lncRNAs to gastric carcinoma and their functional mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that lncRNA gastric carcinoma high expressed transcript 1 (lncRNA-GHET1) was up-regulated in gastric carcinoma. The over-expression of this lncRNA correlates with tumor size, tumor invasion and poor survival. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses demonstrated that GHET1 over-expression promotes the proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of GHET1 inhibits the proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells. RNA pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that GHET1 physically associates with insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) and enhances the physical interaction between c-Myc mRNA and IGF2BP1, consequently increasing the stability of c-Myc mRNA and expression. The expression of GHET1 and c-Myc is strongly correlated in gastric carcinoma tissues. Depletion of c-Myc abolishes the effects of GHET1 on proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that GHET1 plays a pivotal role in gastric carcinoma cell proliferation via increasing c-Myc mRNA stability and expression, which suggests potential use of GHET1 for the prognosis and treatment of gastric carcinoma.",

As a result, it is vital to identify novel diagnostic and prognostic marker of bladder cancer. A growing volume of literature has implicated the vital role of long noncoding RNA in the development of cancer. GHET1, a recently identified lncRNA, was initially characterized in gastric cancer. However, its role in bladder cancer remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that GHET1 was upregulated in bladder cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues and its over-expression correlates with tumor size, advanced tumor and lymph node status, and poor survival. GHET1 knockdown suppressed the proliferation and invasion of bladder cancer cells in vitro. In the meantime, inhibition of GHET1 reversed the epithelial-mesenchymal-transition in bladder cancer cell line. Taken together, our study suggests that the potential use of GHET1 as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target of bladder cancer.",

Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) attract much attention of researchers, and they are demonstrated to be dysregulated in a variety of cancers, including HCC. LncRNA gastric carcinoma high expressed transcript 1 lncRNA GHET1 is found to be dysregulated in gastric cancer (GC). However, its clinical value and potential biological function in HCC remains unclear. In this study, the expression level of GHET1 was analyzed in 72 HCC tissues and matched normal tissues by using Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). GHET1 expression was significantly up-regulated in HCC tissues and the higher level of GHET1 was related to vascular invasion, cirrhosis, tumor size, edmindson grade, and poor prognosis. Moreover, knockdown of GHET1 inhibited cell proliferation of HCC, and also caused cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis in HCC cell lines. We also found that GHET1 could epigenetically repress transcription of Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) in HCC cells by recruiting PRC2 into KLF2 promoter region. Our results indicated that lncRNA GHET1, as a growth regulator, might serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and therapy target for HCC.",

In the present study, the expression patterns of GHET1 in HNC were determined and its clinical significance was assessed. The expression level of GHET1 was significantly increased in HNC tissues, compared with paired adjacent normal tissues.

However, the function and underlying mechanisms of lncRNA GHET1 in gastric cancer are not fully understood. In this study, the expression of GHET1 was investigated in gastric cancer and it was determined whether GHET1 may potentially be used as a biomarker for the disease. The gastric cancer cell lines MGC‑803 and AGS were transfected with GHET1‑directed small interfering RNA (siRNA) and the changes in phenotype and cell‑cycle‑related molecules were assessed. The downregulation of GHET1 induced G0/G1‑phase arrest in gastric cancer cells and inhibited their proliferation, migration, and invasion. DNA synthesis and the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) decreased, which was consistent with the results of the CCK‑8 assay. The levels of specific cell‑cycle regulators were determined and the expression and activities of positive cell‑cycle regulators (cyclin D, CDK4, CDK6, cyclin E, CDK2) were reduced, whereas those of a negative regulator (P21) were increased in GHET1‑knockdown cells. Taken together, the present findings show that the downregulation of GHET1 not only inhibits the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells, but also inhibits their proliferation, at least in part by upregulating P21 expression and downregulating cyclin and CDK expression to inhibit the G0/G1 to S phase transition. The present findings may provide a potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer."

Our approach in vaccine development uses recombinant expression of the highly immunogenic HAV antigen VP1-P2a in food-grade lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis and in Escherichia coli. We used genetic constructs that enable nisin-controlled expression of the antigen in L. lactis in three different forms: (a) intracellularly, (b) on the bacterial surface and (c) on the bacterial surface fused with the fragment of the E. coli flagellin molecule that can act as a molecular adjuvant. Expression of the two surface forms of the antigen was achieved in L. lactis, and the resulting antigen-displaying bacteria were administered orally to mice. Half the animals in each of the two groups developed specific IgGs, with titers increasing over time and reaching 1:422 without flagellin and 1:320 with flagellin. A much higher titer 1:25,803 was observed with the parenterally administered antigen, which was purified from E. coli. With the latter, a significant mucosal IgA response was also observed. Despite significant titers, the IgGs elicited with oral or parenteral administration could not prevent HAV from infecting cells in a virus neutralization assay, suggesting that the antibodies cannot recognize viral surface epitopes. Nevertheless, orally administered HAV antigen expressed in L. lactis elicited significant systemic humoral immune response showing the feasibility for development of effective HAV vaccine for mucosal delivery.",

However, conventional technologies for preparing an injectable vaccine require purification of the antigenic protein and preparation of an adjuvant. Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 (L. lactis) could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of edible vaccine. In previous study, we constructed a multi-epitope vaccine, designated CTB-UE, which is composed of the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), three Th cell epitopes and two B-cell epitopes from urease subunits. To develop a novel type of oral vaccine against H. pylori, genetically modified L. lactis strains were established to secrete this epitope vaccine extracellularly in this study. Oral prophylactic immunization with recombinant L. lactis significantly elicited humoral anti-urease antibody responses (P < 0.001) and reduced the gastric colonization of H. pylori from 7.14 ± 0.95 to 4.68 ± 0.98 log10 CFU g(-1) stomach. This L. lactis oral vaccine offers a promising vaccine candidate for the control of H. pylori infection.",

The delivery of DNA plasmids into eukaryotic cells is of critical importance for subsequent DNA expression and effectiveness of the vaccine. In this context, the use of the recombinant invasive L. lactis FnBPA+ (fibronectin-binding protein A) strain for the oral delivery of the eukaryotic expression vector vaccination using lactic acid bacteria (pValac), coding for the 6-kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6) gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, could represent a new DNA vaccine strategy against tuberculosis. To this end, the ESAT-6 sequence was cloned into the pValac vector; the L. lactis fibronectin-binding protein A (FnBPA)+ (pValac:ESAT-6) strain was obtained, and its immunological profile was checked in BALB/c mice. This strain was able to significantly increase interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production in spleen cells, showing a systemic T helper 1 (Th1) cell response. The mice also showed a significant increase in specific secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) production in colon tissue and fecal extracts. Thus, this is the first time that L. lactis has been used to deliver a plasmid DNA harboring a gene that encodes an antigen against tuberculosis through mucous membranes.",

Current influenza A vaccines predominantly focus on hemagglutinin (HA) and show strain-specific protection. Neuraminidase (NA) is much less studied in the context of humoral immunity against influenza A viruses. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cross protective immunity of NA presented on Lactococcus lactis (L.lactis) surface against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in the mouse model. L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA was constructed in which pgsA was used as an anchor protein. Mice vaccinated orally with L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA could elicit significant NA-specific serum IgG and mucosa IgA antibodies, as well as neuraminidase inhibition (NI) titers. Importantly, L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA provided 80% protection against H5N1, 60% protection against H3N2 and H1N1, respectively. These findings suggest that recombinant L.lactis/pNZ110-pgsA-NA in the absence of adjuvant via oral administration can be served as an effective vaccine candidate against diverse strains of influenza A viruses.",
        "# Title: Broadly protective immunity against divergent influenza viruses by oral co-administration of Lactococcus lactis expressing nucleoprotein adjuvanted with cholera toxin B subunit in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines need to be annually reformulated to well match the predicated circulating strains. Thus, it is critical for developing a novel universal influenza vaccine that would be able to confer cross-protection against constantly emerging divergent influenza virus strains. Influenza virus A is a genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses. Influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) is a structural protein which encapsidates the negative strand viral RNA, and anti-NP antibodies play role in cross-protective immunity. Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) is an ideal vaccine delivery vehicle via oral administration route. However, L. lactis vectored vaccine exhibits poor immunogenicity without the use of mucosal adjuvant. To enhance the immunogenicity of L. lactis vectored vaccine, cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit, one of mucosal adjuvants, is a safe adjuvant for oral route, when combined with L. lactis vectored vaccine. In this study, we hypothesized that pNZ8008, a L. lactis expression plasmid, encoding NP antigen, would be able to elicit cross-protection with the use of CTB via oral administration route.",
        "# Title: Cross-protection of Lactococcus lactis-displayed HA2 subunit against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines provide strain-specific protection against homologous subtypes and need to be updated annually. Therefore, it is essential to develop a universal vaccine that would induce broadly cross-protective immunity against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses. The highly conserved HA2 subunit is a promising candidate for developing a universal influenza vaccine. Here, we hypothesized that the HA2 subunit could be displayed on the surface of Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis), using Spax as an anchor protein (L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2) and that L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 would have immunogenicity by oral administration without the use of adjuvant in the mouse model. To address this hypothesis, we show that oral vaccination of mice with L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 elicited significant humoral and mucosal immune responses. Importantly, L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 provided 100% protection against homologous H5N1 or heterologous H1N1 virus challenge. These results suggest that an HA2 subunit presented on the surface of L. lactis is an effective universal vaccine candidate against influenza A viruses in the poultry industry and in humans.",

Most of the current HIV vaccines under development use the i.m. route for immunization, which is relatively poor in generating potent and long-lived mucosal immune responses. In this article, we explore the ability of an oral vaccination with a probiotic organism, Lactococcus lactis, to elicit HIV-specific immune responses in the mucosal and systemic compartments of BALB/c mice. We expressed the HIV-1 Gag-p24 on the tip of the T3 pilus of Streptococcus pyogenes as a fusion to the Cpa protein (LL-Gag). After four monthly LL-Gag oral immunizations, we observed strong Gag-specific IgG and IgA responses in serum, feces, and vaginal secretions. However, the Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses in the blood were at or below our detection limit. After an i.m. modified vaccinia Ankara/Gag boost, we observed robust Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses both in systemic and in mucosal tissues, including intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes of the small intestine, Peyer's patches, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Consistent with strong immunogenicity, the LL-Gag induced activation of CD11c(+) CD11b(+) dendritic cells in the Peyer's patches after oral immunization. Our results demonstrate that oral immunization with L. lactis expressing an Ag on the tip of the group A Streptococcus pilus serves as an excellent vaccine platform to induce strong mucosal humoral and cellular immunity against HIV.",

        "# Title: Production and delivery of Helicobacter pylori NapA in Lactococcus lactis and its protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity.\n# Abstract: Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein A subunit (NapA) has been identified as a virulence factor, a protective antigen and a potent immunomodulator. NapA shows unique application potentials for anti-H. pylori vaccines and treatment strategies of certain allergic diseases and carcinomas. However, appropriate production and utilization modes of NapA still remain uncertain to date. This work has established a novel efficient production and utilization mode of NapA by using L. lactis as an expression host and delivery vector, and demonstrated immune protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity of the engineered L. lactis by oral vaccination of mice. It was observed for the first time that H. pylori NapA promotes both polarized Th17 and Th1 responses, which may greatly affect the clinical application of NapA. This report offers a promising anti-H. pylori oral vaccine candidate and a potent mucosal immune modulatory agent. Meanwhile, it uncovers a way to produce and deliver the oral vaccine and immunomodulator by fermentation of food like milk, which might have striking effects on control of H. pylori infection, gastrointestinal cancers, and Th2 bias allergic diseases, including many food allergies.",
        "# Title: Protective immunity induced by an intranasal multivalent vaccine comprising 10 Lactococcus lactis strains expressing highly prevalent M-protein antigens derived from Group A Streptococcus.\n# Abstract: Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) causes diseases ranging from mild pharyngitis to severe invasive infections. The N-terminal fragment of streptococcal M protein elicits protective antibodies and is an attractive vaccine target. However, this N- terminal fragment is hypervariable: there are more than 200 different M types. In this study, an intranasal live bacterial vaccine comprising 10 strains of Lactococcus lactis, each expressing one N-terminal fragment of M protein, has been developed. Live bacterial-vectored vaccines cost less to manufacture because the processes involved are less complex than those required for production of protein subunit vaccines. Moreover, intranasal administration does not require syringes or specialized personnel. Evaluation of individual vaccine types (M1, M2, M3, M4, M6, M9, M12, M22, M28 and M77) showed that most of them protected mice against challenge with virulent S. pyogenes. All 10 strains combined in a 10-valent vaccine (M×10) induced serum and bronchoalveolar lavage IgG titers that ranged from three- to 10-fold those of unimmunized mice. After intranasal challenge with M28 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice was significantly higher than that of unimmunized mice. In contrast, when mice were challenged with M75 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice did not differ significantly from that of unimmunized mice. Mx-10 immunized mice had significantly less S. pyogenes in oropharyngeal washes and developed less severe disease symptoms after challenge than did unimmunized mice. Our L. lactis-based vaccine may provide an alternative solution to development of broadly protective group A streptococcal vaccines.",
        "# Title: Mucosal and systemic immune responses elicited by recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a fusion protein composed of pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin from Bordetella pertussis.\n# Abstract: We constructed a food-grade expression system harboring a F1S1 fusion protein of Bordetella pertussis to be produced in Lactococcus lactis NZ3900 as a new oral vaccine model against whooping cough, caused by B. pertussis. F1S1 was composed of N-terminally truncated S1 subunit of pertussis toxin and type I immunodominant domain of filamentous hemagglutinin which are both known as protective immunogens against pertussis. The recombinant L. lactis was administered via oral or intranasal routes to BALB/c mice and the related specific systemic and mucosal immune responses were then evaluated. The results indicated significantly higher levels of specific IgA in the lung extracts and IgG in sera of mucosally-immunized mice, compared to their controls. It was revealed that higher levels of IgG2a, compared to IgG1, were produced in all mucosally-immunized mice. Moreover, immunized mice developed Th1 responses with high levels of IFN-γ production by the spleen cells. These findings provide evidence for L. lactis to be used as a suitable vehicle for expression and delivery of F1S1 fusion protein to mucosa and induction of appropriate systemic and mucosal immune responses against pertussis.",
        "# Title: Rotavirus VP6 protein mucosally delivered by cell wall-derived particles from Lactococcus lactis induces protection against infection in a murine model.\n# Abstract: Rotaviruses are the primary cause of acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide. Although the implementation of live attenuated vaccines has reduced the number of rotavirus-associated deaths, variance in their effectiveness has been reported in different countries. This fact, among other concerns, leads to continuous efforts for the development of new generation of vaccines against rotavirus.In this work, we describe the obtention of cell wall-derived particles from a recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a cell wall-anchored version of the rotavirus VP6 protein. After confirming by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, flow cytometry and electronic immunomicroscopy that these particles were carrying the VP6 protein, their immunogenic potential was evaluated in adult BALB/c mice. For that, mucosal immunizations (oral or intranasal), with or without the dmLT [(double mutant Escherichia coli heat labile toxin LT(R192G/L211A)] adjuvant were performed. The results showed that these cell wall-derived particles were able to generate anti-rotavirus IgG and IgA antibodies only when administered intranasally, whether the adjuvant was present or not. However, the presence of dmLT was necessary to confer protection against rotavirus infection, which was evidenced by a 79.5 percent viral shedding reduction.In summary, this work describes the production of cell wall-derived particles which were able to induce a protective immune response after intranasal immunization. Further studies are needed to characterize the immune response elicited by these particles as well as to determine their potential as an alternative to the use of live L. lactis for mucosal antigen delivery.",

        "# Title: A Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB)-Based Vaccine Candidate for Human Norovirus.\n# Abstract: Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are responsible for more than 95% of the non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis epidemics in the world. The CDC estimates that every year 21 million individuals suffer from HuNoV-induced gastroenteritis in the United States. Currently, there is no FDA-approved vaccine for HuNoVs. Development of an effective vaccine has been hampered by the lack of an efficient cell culture system for HuNoVs and a suitable small animal model for pathogenesis study. In this study, we developed lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as a vector to deliver HuNoV antigen. A LAB strain (Lactococcus lactis) carrying VP1 gene of a HuNoV GII.4 virus (LAB-VP1) was constructed. It was found that HuNoV VP1 protein was highly expressed by LAB vector and was secreted into media supernatants. To test whether LAB-based HuNoV vaccine candidate is immunogenic, 4-day-old gnotobiotic piglets were orally inoculated with various doses of LAB-VP1. It was found that LABs were persistent in the small intestine of piglets and shed in pig feces for at least 25 days post inoculation. LAB DNA and VP1 were detected in mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen tissue in LAB-VP1 inoculated groups. HuNoV-specific IgG and IgA were detectable in serum and feces respectively at day 13 post-inoculation, and further increased at later time points. After being challenged with HuNoV GII.4 strain, a large amount of HuNoV antigens were observed in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum sections of the intestine in the LAB control group. In contrast, significantly less, or no, HuNoV antigens were detected in the LAB-VP1 immunized groups. Collectively, these results demonstrate that a LAB-based HuNoV vaccine induces protective immunity in gnotobiotic piglets.",

        "# Title: Mucosal Vaccination with Lactococcus lactis-Secreting Surface Immunological Protein Induces Humoral and Cellular Immune Protection against Group B Streptococcus in a Murine Model.\n# Abstract: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the primary etiological agent of sepsis and meningitis in newborns and is associated with premature birth and stillbirth. The development of a licensed vaccine is one of the pending challenges for the World Health Organization. Previously, we showed that oral immunization with surface immune protein (SIP) decreases vaginal colonization of GBS and generates functional opsonizing antibodies, which was determined by opsonophagocytic assays (OPA) in vitro. We also showed that the protein has an adjuvant vaccine profile. Therefore, an oral vaccine based on SIP may be an attractive alternative to employ in the development of new vaccines against GBS. Lactococcus lactis is a highlighted oral vaccine probiotic inducer of the mucosal immune response. This bacterium could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of an edible vaccine and has been used in clinical trials. In this study, we showed that an oral vaccine with a recombinant L. lactis strain secreting SIP from GBS (rL. lactis-SIP) can induce protective humoral and cellular immunity in an experimental model of GBS vaginal colonization in C57BL/6 mice. Mice immunized with rL. lactis-SIP were protected against clinical symptoms and bacterial colonization after GBS vaginal colonization. Our rL. lactis-SIP vaccine also induces an increase of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) specifically against SIP. The adoptive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice to naïve mice generated protection against GBS vaginal colonization. Moreover, the rL. lactis-SIP strain induces the activation of SIP-specific T cells, which could decrease GBS vaginal colonization and generate protective antibodies when transferred to other mice. Our experimental observations strongly support the notion that rL. lactis-SIP induces protective humoral and cellular immunity and could be considered as a novel alternative in the development of vaccines for GBS.",
        "# Title: Recombinant Lactococcus Lactis Displaying Omp31 Antigen of Brucella melitensis Can Induce an Immunogenic Response in BALB/c Mice.\n# Abstract: Since Brucella infection mostly occurs through the mucosal surfaces, immune response induced by vaccine that is delivered by a way of mucosal route can be drastically enhanced to control the brucellosis. Omp31is the major outer membrane protein of Brucella, and is considered as a protective antigen against Brucella infection. Accordingly, Lactococcus lactis has been used as an antigen-delivering vector to develop a vaccine-induced mucosal response for having a safer vaccination against brucellosis. A designed omp31 gene fused to the usp45 signal peptide and M6 cell wall anchor was sub cloned in the pNZ7021 expression vector, and a recombinant L. lactis displaying Omp31 was constructed. Omp31 protein expression was confirmed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. Animals were orally and intraperitoneally immunized with live or killed L. lactis expressing Omp31, respectively. The humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated by measuring the specific cytokines and antibodies. sIgA, serum IgA, IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in the mice immunized with live recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31 and also serum IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in mice immunized with killed recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31. Among IgG subtypes, IgG2a response was significantly higher in both groups compared to IgG1. In mice groups immunized with recombinant L. lactis, the IFN-γ and IL-10 level elevated; however, there was no change in the level of IL-4. These results indicated that recombinants L. lactis induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, and also vaccines based on L. lactis-derived live carriers are promising interventions against Brucella melitensis infections.",
        "# Title: Lactococcus lactis FNBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) Induces Cellular and Humoral Immune Responses After Oral Immunization of Mice.\n# Abstract: The development of a new vaccine strategy against tuberculosis is urgently needed and has been greatly encouraged by the scientific community worldwide. In this work, we constructed a lactococcal DNA vaccine based on the fusion of two Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens, ESAT-6 and Ag85A, and examined its immunogenicity. The coding sequences of the ESAT-6 and Ag85A genes were fused and cloned into the eukaryotic expression pValac vector, and the functionality of the vector was confirmed in vitro. Then, L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) was obtained and used for oral immunization of mice. This strain induced significant increases in IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-17 cytokines in stimulated splenocyte cultures, and significant production of antigen-specific sIgA was observed in the colonic tissues of immunized mice. We demonstrated that L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) generated a cellular and humoral immune response after oral immunization of mice. The strategy developed in this work may represent an interesting DNA mucosal vaccine candidate against tuberculosis, using the fusion of two highly immunogenic antigens delivered by safe lactic acid bacteria.",
        "# Title: Protective Immunity Against Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli by Oral Vaccination of Engineered Lactococcus lactis.\n# Abstract: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the leading causes of diarrhea in children globally, and thus suitable vaccines are desired. Antigen display on lactic acid bacteria is a reliable approach for efficient oral vaccination and preventing bowel diseases. To develop an oral vaccine against ETEC, the gene of the binding domain from heat-labile toxin (LTB), a key ETEC virulence factor, was codon-optimized and cloned into a construct containing a signal peptide and an anchor for display on L. lactis. Bioinformatics analysis showed a codon adaptation index of 0.95 for the codon-optimized gene. Cell surface expression of LTB was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and blotting. White New Zealand rabbits were immunized per os (PO) with the recombinant L. lactis, and the antibody titers were assayed with ELISA. In vitro neutralization assay was performed using mouse adrenal tumor cells and rabbit ileal loop test was performed as the in vivo assay. ELISA results indicated that oral administration of the engineered L. lactis elicited a significant production of IgA in the intestine. In vitro neutralization assay showed that the effect of the toxin could be neutralized with 500 µg/ml of IgG isolated from the oral vaccine group. Furthermore, the dose of ETEC causing fluid accumulation in the ileal loop test showed a tenfold increase in rabbits immunized with either recombinant L. lactis or LTB protein compared to other groups. Our results imply that recombinant L. lactis could potentially be an effective live oral vaccine against ETEC toxicity.",
        "# Title: Oral Immunization of Mice with Cell Extracts from Recombinant Lactococcus lactis Expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein.\n# Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all over the world and became a pandemic that named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). At present, several intramuscular vaccines have been successfully developed and mass vaccination has progressed in many countries. The aim of the study is to develop and examine an oral vaccine against COVID-19 with recombinant Lactococcus lactis IL1403, a strain of lactic acid bacteria, expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) S1 subunit as an immunizing antigen. PBS or cell extracts from recombinant L. lactis were orally administered into mice (control VS treatment), and formation of antigen-specific antibodies and changes in the gut microbiome were analyzed. Intracellular antigen was detected, but its secretion was not successful. After immunization, antigen-specific serum IgG and fecal IgA levels were 1.5-fold (P = 0.002) and 1.4-fold (P = 0.016) higher in the immunized mice (treatment) than control, respectively. Gut microbiome profiles were clearly separated between the two groups when analyzed for beta diversity with overall similarity. At the genus level, while Coprococcus (P = 0.036) and unclassified genus of Ruminococcaceae (P = 0.037) in treatment were more abundant than control, rc4-4 (P = 0.013) and Stenotrophomonas (P = 0.021) were less abundant. Our results indicate that cell extract containing SARS-CoV-2 antigen can induce mice to produce antigen-specific antibodies without overall changes in the gut microbiome. This strategy may be useful for the development of other oral viral vaccines.",
        "# Title: Oral Immunization With a M Cell-Targeting Recombinant L. Lactis Vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE Stimulate Protective Immunity Against H. Pylori in Mice.\n# Abstract: There are many virulence factors of H. pylori that contribute in diverse ways to gastric disease. Therefore, designing multivalent epitope vaccines against many key virulence factors virulence factors of H. pylori is a promising strategy to control H. pylori infection. In previous studies, we constructed a multivalent epitope vaccine FVpE against four key virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), and oral immunization with the FVpE vaccine plus a polysaccharide adjuvant (PA) containing lycium barbarum polysaccharide and chitosan could provide protection against H. pylori infection in the Mongolian gerbil model. Oral vaccines have many advantages over injected vaccines, such as improved safety and compliance, and easier manufacturing and administration. However, the harsh gastrointestinal (GI) environment, such as gastric acid and proteolytic enzymes, limits the development of oral vaccines to some extent. Oral vaccines need a gastrointestinal delivery system with high safety, low price and promoting vaccine antigen to stimulate immune response in the gastrointestinal mucosa. Lactic acid bacteria are gastrointestinal probiotics that have unique advantages as a delivery system for oral vaccines. In this study, a M cell-targeting surface display system for L. lactis named plSAM was designed to help vaccine antigens to stimulate effective immune responses in the gastrointestinal tract, and a M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE was constructed by using the surface display system plSAM. recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE could secretively express the SAM-FVpE protein and display it on the bacterial surface. Moreover, experimental results confirmed that LL-plSAM-FVpE had an enhanced M cell-targeting property. In addition, LL-plSAM-FVpE had excellent M cell-targeting property to promote the phagocytosis and transport of the antigen SAM-FVpE by gastrointestinal M cells. More importantly, oral immunization of LL-plSAM-FVpE or SAM-FVpE plus PA can stimulate IgG and sIgA antibodies and CD4+ T cell immune responses against four virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), thus providing protective immunity against H. pylori infection in mice. The M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine against various key H. pylori virulence factors could be a promising vaccine candidate for controlling H. pylori infection.",
        "# Title: Oral and intranasal immunization with food-grade recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing high conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein triggers mice's immunity responses.\n# Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic began at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread throughout the world. Vaccination is still the most effective method of prevention of pathogenic infections, including viral infections. However, there is little evidence that vaccination can protect against SARS-CoV-2 virus for a long time. Thus, regular re-vaccination is necessary to control COVID-19. Vaccination by injection is invasive, and is one of the reasons people refuse to get re-vaccinated. Therefore, we developed a less invasive vaccine based on oral or nasal administration. The gene encoding the high conserved region (HCR) spike protein was inserted into pNZ8149 and expressed in L.lactis NZ3900. Mice were immunized at 3-week intervals with oral or nasal routes. Anti-SARS-CoV2 spike antibody (IgG and IgA) level were measured using ELISA method before and after treatment. Plasma cells population in lymph were analyzed using flowcytometry and the CD4 + and CD8 + cells in lymph and intestine were analyzed using immunofluorescence method. The results of nasal and oral administration in experimental animals showed that L.lactis carrying the HCR gene could induce a humoral immune response, as indicated by increased levels of IgG and IgA against SARS-CoV-2 (IgG/IgA-SARS-CoV-2). The plasma cell population after nasal and oral vaccination in mice were significantly different with control group (p < 0.05). The CD4 + and CD8 + cells in intestine were significantly higher in orally immunized group mice than control group. The CD8 + cells in lymph were significantly higher in intranasal immunized group mice than control group. Our data demonstrate L.lactis expressing spike protein can be developed into a less invasive alternative to nasal and oral vaccination.",
        "# Title: Expanding strain coverage of a group A Streptococcus pilus-expressing Lactococcus lactis mucosal vaccine.\n# Abstract: Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a human pathogenic bacterium that can trigger a wide range of diseases, including the autoimmune diseases acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, causing major morbidity and mortality in many low- and middle-income countries. Primary intervention programs have had limited success thus far, and a licensed vaccine has yet to be developed. The pilus of GAS is known to be involved in host cell adhesion, biofilm formation and immune evasion. We have a mucosal vaccine in development that expresses the pilus of GAS on the surface of the nonpathogenic bacterium Lactococcus lactis. To expand strain coverage, we combined seven L. lactis constructs, each expressing a different GAS pilus variant, and investigated the systemic and mucosal immune responses following immunization. Mice immunized with this combination showed specific immunoglobin G and immunoglobin A responses to the GAS pilus proteins of vaccine strains, at levels comparable to mice immunized with a single construct. Cross-reactivity to pilus proteins of nonvaccine strains was also evident. Furthermore, protective efficacy against a homologous strain of GAS in a murine nasopharyngeal colonization model was observed. Overall, this study provides further evidence for using pilus-expressing lactic acid bacteria as a vaccine to prevent upper respiratory tract GAS infections."

Twenty children on dialysis intended to perform a 12-week graded community-based exercise program. Exercise capacity and fatigue level were studied; muscle force and health-related quality of life were secondary outcomes. All outcomes were measured at baseline (T = 0) and after intervention (T = 1). Fourteen of the 20 patients (70%) either did not start the program or did not complete the program. Of these patients, seven did not complete or even start the exercise program because of a combination of lack of time and motivational problems. Six patients were not able to continue the program or were unable to do the follow-up measurements because of medical problems. Exercise capacity and muscle strength was higher after the exercise program in the children who completed the training. In conclusion, exercise training is difficult to perform in children with ESRD and is not always feasible in real-life situations for many children with ESRD.",

The aim of this study was to determine if twice-weekly exercise for 1 h during HD could improve exercise capacity in children receiving HD. We assessed lower extremity strength (Biodex; dominant extension peak torque in 60 degrees per second, Newton-meters), grip strength (dynanometer, kilogram) and 6-min walk capacity (yards) in ten children (median age 13.6 years, range 8-25 years) at baseline and after 3 months of twice weekly exercise for 1 h during HD. Baseline assessment revealed a mean (1) Biodex of 70 +/- 32 N-m/s, (2) 6-m walk test of 589 +/- 90 yards and (3) grip strength of 23.2 +/- 10 kg, which were 50% lower than the normal value for healthy controls. Patients demonstrated significant improvements in lower extremity strength and 6-min walk test after 3 months of exercise. Our data show that twice-weekly exercise of a moderate intensity during HD can lead to exercise capacity improvement in 3 months. We identified barriers to and strategies for the successful implementation of intradialytic exercise. We suggest that intradialytic exercise intervention may be effective to improve exercise capacity in children receiving maintenance HD.",

Aerobic, strengthening exercises, and exergames are reported as effective in the treatment of symptoms associated with CKD. Unlike adult patients, there are insufficient studies investigating the effects of exercise on disease-related symptoms in pediatric CKD. This study aimed to compare the effects of Nintendo Wii-based exergaming and home-based fun video exercises on functional capacity, muscle strength, physical activity (PA), depression, fatigue, and QoL in pediatric patients with CKD. Twenty-three pediatric patients with CKD were included in the study and randomized to group I (Nintendo Wii Fit) and group II (home-based fun video exercises). Patients in both groups underwent exercise programs twice per week for 6 weeks. Functional capacity, muscle strength, PA, QoL, fatigue, and depression of the patients were evaluated before and after the treatments. Sixteen patients completed the study. After treatment, significant differences were observed in both groups on 6MWT, muscle strength, average daily steps, PedsQoL Child Self-Report PHSS, and the Visual Fatigue Scale. Left knee flexor muscle strength and average step counts were found to be superior in group I. Both exergaming and home-based fun video exercises provide positive effects on functional capacity, muscle strength, fatigue, PA, depression, and QoL in pediatric patients with CKD. We think that these exercise methods can help to protect physical and mental health of patients and should be included in treatment from the early stages of the disease."

The median injected activity of 18F-rhPSMA-7 was 327 MBq (range, 132-410 MBq), with a median uptake time of 79.5 min (range, 60-153 min). All patients underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection. The presence of lymph node metastases was determined by an experienced reader independently for both the PET and the morphologic datasets using a template-based analysis on a 5-point scale. Patient-level and template-based results were both compared with histopathologic findings. Results: Lymph node metastases were present in 18 patients (31.0%) and were located in 52 of 375 templates (13.9%). Receiver-operating-characteristic analyses showed 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET to perform significantly better than morphologic imaging on both patient-based and template-based analyses (areas under curve, 0.858 vs. 0.649 [P = 0.012] and 0.765 vs. 0.589 [P < 0.001], respectively). On patient-based analyses, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET were 72.2%, 92.5%, and 86.2%, respectively, and those of morphologic imaging were 50.0%, 72.5%, and 65.5%, respectively. On template-based analyses, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET were 53.8%, 96.9%, and 90.9%, respectively, and those of morphologic imaging were 9.6%, 95.0%, and 83.2%, respectively. Conclusion:18F-rhPSMA-7 PET is superior to morphologic imaging for N-staging of high-risk primary PC. The efficacy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 is similar to published data for 68Ga-PSMA-11.",

        "# Title: Diagnostic Accuracy of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT Imaging for Lymph Node Staging of Prostate Carcinoma in Primary and Biochemical Recurrence.\n# Abstract: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-ligand PET/CT is performed on patients with prostate cancer to stage the disease initially or to identify sites of recurrence after definitive therapy. On the basis of clinical results, 18F-PSMA-1007 is a promising PSMA PET tracer, but detailed histologic confirmation has been lacking. Methods: Ninety-six patients with prostate cancer underwent 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT followed by either radical prostatectomy with lymphadenectomy or salvage lymphadenectomy. The histologic findings of PSMA PET-positive nodes were analyzed retrospectively. A lesion-based and patient-based analysis was performed comparing all positive lesions and only lesions larger than 3 mm on histopathology. Results: Of the patients, 90.6% received 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT for staging before the primary treatment, whereas 9.4% underwent imaging for biochemical recurrence. In 34.4% of the cohort, positive lymph nodes were present on imaging. In total, 1,746 lymph nodes were dissected in 96 patients. 18F-PSMA-1007 PET had a lesion-based sensitivity of 81.7%, a specificity of 99.6%, a positive predictive value of 92.4%, and a negative predictive value of 98.9% for detecting positive lymph nodes larger than 3 mm. In the analysis of all malignant nodes regardless of size, the overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value on lesion-based analysis were 71.2%, 99.5%, 91.3%, and 97.9%, respectively. The patient-based analysis showed a sensitivity of 85.9% and a specificity of 99.5% for lymph nodes larger than 3 mm. Conclusion:18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT reliably detects malignant lymph nodes and has an exceptional specificity of more than 99% for nodal metastases.",

Our approach in vaccine development uses recombinant expression of the highly immunogenic HAV antigen VP1-P2a in food-grade lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis and in Escherichia coli. We used genetic constructs that enable nisin-controlled expression of the antigen in L. lactis in three different forms: (a) intracellularly, (b) on the bacterial surface and (c) on the bacterial surface fused with the fragment of the E. coli flagellin molecule that can act as a molecular adjuvant. Expression of the two surface forms of the antigen was achieved in L. lactis, and the resulting antigen-displaying bacteria were administered orally to mice. Half the animals in each of the two groups developed specific IgGs, with titers increasing over time and reaching 1:422 without flagellin and 1:320 with flagellin. A much higher titer 1:25,803 was observed with the parenterally administered antigen, which was purified from E. coli. With the latter, a significant mucosal IgA response was also observed. Despite significant titers, the IgGs elicited with oral or parenteral administration could not prevent HAV from infecting cells in a virus neutralization assay, suggesting that the antibodies cannot recognize viral surface epitopes. Nevertheless, orally administered HAV antigen expressed in L. lactis elicited significant systemic humoral immune response showing the feasibility for development of effective HAV vaccine for mucosal delivery.",
        "# Title: Oral immunization with recombinant Lactococcus lactis delivering a multi-epitope antigen CTB-UE attenuates Helicobacter pylori infection in mice.\n# Abstract: Urease is an essential virulence factor and colonization factor for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and is considered as an excellent vaccine candidate antigen. However, conventional technologies for preparing an injectable vaccine require purification of the antigenic protein and preparation of an adjuvant. Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 (L. lactis) could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of edible vaccine. In previous study, we constructed a multi-epitope vaccine, designated CTB-UE, which is composed of the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), three Th cell epitopes and two B-cell epitopes from urease subunits. To develop a novel type of oral vaccine against H. pylori, genetically modified L. lactis strains were established to secrete this epitope vaccine extracellularly in this study. Oral prophylactic immunization with recombinant L. lactis significantly elicited humoral anti-urease antibody responses (P < 0.001) and reduced the gastric colonization of H. pylori from 7.14 ± 0.95 to 4.68 ± 0.98 log10 CFU g(-1) stomach. This L. lactis oral vaccine offers a promising vaccine candidate for the control of H. pylori infection.",
        "# Title: Development of a new DNA vaccine based on mycobacterial ESAT-6 antigen delivered by recombinant invasive Lactococcus lactis FnBPA+.\n# Abstract: The use of the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis as a vehicle for the oral delivery of DNA vaccine plasmids constitutes a promising strategy for vaccination. The delivery of DNA plasmids into eukaryotic cells is of critical importance for subsequent DNA expression and effectiveness of the vaccine. In this context, the use of the recombinant invasive L. lactis FnBPA+ (fibronectin-binding protein A) strain for the oral delivery of the eukaryotic expression vector vaccination using lactic acid bacteria (pValac), coding for the 6-kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6) gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, could represent a new DNA vaccine strategy against tuberculosis. To this end, the ESAT-6 sequence was cloned into the pValac vector; the L. lactis fibronectin-binding protein A (FnBPA)+ (pValac:ESAT-6) strain was obtained, and its immunological profile was checked in BALB/c mice. This strain was able to significantly increase interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production in spleen cells, showing a systemic T helper 1 (Th1) cell response. The mice also showed a significant increase in specific secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) production in colon tissue and fecal extracts. Thus, this is the first time that L. lactis has been used to deliver a plasmid DNA harboring a gene that encodes an antigen against tuberculosis through mucous membranes.",
        "# Title: Lactococcus lactis displayed neuraminidase confers cross protective immunity against influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Influenza A viruses pose a serious threat to public health. Current influenza A vaccines predominantly focus on hemagglutinin (HA) and show strain-specific protection. Neuraminidase (NA) is much less studied in the context of humoral immunity against influenza A viruses. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cross protective immunity of NA presented on Lactococcus lactis (L.lactis) surface against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in the mouse model. L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA was constructed in which pgsA was used as an anchor protein. Mice vaccinated orally with L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA could elicit significant NA-specific serum IgG and mucosa IgA antibodies, as well as neuraminidase inhibition (NI) titers. Importantly, L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA provided 80% protection against H5N1, 60% protection against H3N2 and H1N1, respectively. These findings suggest that recombinant L.lactis/pNZ110-pgsA-NA in the absence of adjuvant via oral administration can be served as an effective vaccine candidate against diverse strains of influenza A viruses.",
        "# Title: Broadly protective immunity against divergent influenza viruses by oral co-administration of Lactococcus lactis expressing nucleoprotein adjuvanted with cholera toxin B subunit in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines need to be annually reformulated to well match the predicated circulating strains. Thus, it is critical for developing a novel universal influenza vaccine that would be able to confer cross-protection against constantly emerging divergent influenza virus strains. Influenza virus A is a genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses. Influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) is a structural protein which encapsidates the negative strand viral RNA, and anti-NP antibodies play role in cross-protective immunity. Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) is an ideal vaccine delivery vehicle via oral administration route. However, L. lactis vectored vaccine exhibits poor immunogenicity without the use of mucosal adjuvant. To enhance the immunogenicity of L. lactis vectored vaccine, cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit, one of mucosal adjuvants, is a safe adjuvant for oral route, when combined with L. lactis vectored vaccine. In this study, we hypothesized that pNZ8008, a L. lactis expression plasmid, encoding NP antigen, would be able to elicit cross-protection with the use of CTB via oral administration route.",
        "# Title: Cross-protection of Lactococcus lactis-displayed HA2 subunit against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines provide strain-specific protection against homologous subtypes and need to be updated annually. Therefore, it is essential to develop a universal vaccine that would induce broadly cross-protective immunity against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses. The highly conserved HA2 subunit is a promising candidate for developing a universal influenza vaccine. Here, we hypothesized that the HA2 subunit could be displayed on the surface of Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis), using Spax as an anchor protein (L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2) and that L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 would have immunogenicity by oral administration without the use of adjuvant in the mouse model. To address this hypothesis, we show that oral vaccination of mice with L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 elicited significant humoral and mucosal immune responses. Importantly, L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 provided 100% protection against homologous H5N1 or heterologous H1N1 virus challenge. These results suggest that an HA2 subunit presented on the surface of L. lactis is an effective universal vaccine candidate against influenza A viruses in the poultry industry and in humans.",
        "# Title: Oral Immunization with a Recombinant Lactococcus lactis-Expressing HIV-1 Antigen on Group A Streptococcus Pilus Induces Strong Mucosal Immunity in the Gut.\n# Abstract: The induction of a potent humoral and cellular immune response in mucosal tissue is important for the development of an effective HIV vaccine. Most of the current HIV vaccines under development use the i.m. route for immunization, which is relatively poor in generating potent and long-lived mucosal immune responses. In this article, we explore the ability of an oral vaccination with a probiotic organism, Lactococcus lactis, to elicit HIV-specific immune responses in the mucosal and systemic compartments of BALB/c mice. We expressed the HIV-1 Gag-p24 on the tip of the T3 pilus of Streptococcus pyogenes as a fusion to the Cpa protein (LL-Gag). After four monthly LL-Gag oral immunizations, we observed strong Gag-specific IgG and IgA responses in serum, feces, and vaginal secretions. However, the Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses in the blood were at or below our detection limit. After an i.m. modified vaccinia Ankara/Gag boost, we observed robust Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses both in systemic and in mucosal tissues, including intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes of the small intestine, Peyer's patches, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Consistent with strong immunogenicity, the LL-Gag induced activation of CD11c(+) CD11b(+) dendritic cells in the Peyer's patches after oral immunization. Our results demonstrate that oral immunization with L. lactis expressing an Ag on the tip of the group A Streptococcus pilus serves as an excellent vaccine platform to induce strong mucosal humoral and cellular immunity against HIV.",

        "# Title: Production and delivery of Helicobacter pylori NapA in Lactococcus lactis and its protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity.\n# Abstract: Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein A subunit (NapA) has been identified as a virulence factor, a protective antigen and a potent immunomodulator. NapA shows unique application potentials for anti-H. pylori vaccines and treatment strategies of certain allergic diseases and carcinomas. However, appropriate production and utilization modes of NapA still remain uncertain to date. This work has established a novel efficient production and utilization mode of NapA by using L. lactis as an expression host and delivery vector, and demonstrated immune protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity of the engineered L. lactis by oral vaccination of mice. It was observed for the first time that H. pylori NapA promotes both polarized Th17 and Th1 responses, which may greatly affect the clinical application of NapA. This report offers a promising anti-H. pylori oral vaccine candidate and a potent mucosal immune modulatory agent. Meanwhile, it uncovers a way to produce and deliver the oral vaccine and immunomodulator by fermentation of food like milk, which might have striking effects on control of H. pylori infection, gastrointestinal cancers, and Th2 bias allergic diseases, including many food allergies.",
        "# Title: Protective immunity induced by an intranasal multivalent vaccine comprising 10 Lactococcus lactis strains expressing highly prevalent M-protein antigens derived from Group A Streptococcus.\n# Abstract: Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) causes diseases ranging from mild pharyngitis to severe invasive infections. The N-terminal fragment of streptococcal M protein elicits protective antibodies and is an attractive vaccine target. However, this N- terminal fragment is hypervariable: there are more than 200 different M types. In this study, an intranasal live bacterial vaccine comprising 10 strains of Lactococcus lactis, each expressing one N-terminal fragment of M protein, has been developed. Live bacterial-vectored vaccines cost less to manufacture because the processes involved are less complex than those required for production of protein subunit vaccines. Moreover, intranasal administration does not require syringes or specialized personnel. Evaluation of individual vaccine types (M1, M2, M3, M4, M6, M9, M12, M22, M28 and M77) showed that most of them protected mice against challenge with virulent S. pyogenes. All 10 strains combined in a 10-valent vaccine (M×10) induced serum and bronchoalveolar lavage IgG titers that ranged from three- to 10-fold those of unimmunized mice. After intranasal challenge with M28 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice was significantly higher than that of unimmunized mice. In contrast, when mice were challenged with M75 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice did not differ significantly from that of unimmunized mice. Mx-10 immunized mice had significantly less S. pyogenes in oropharyngeal washes and developed less severe disease symptoms after challenge than did unimmunized mice. Our L. lactis-based vaccine may provide an alternative solution to development of broadly protective group A streptococcal vaccines.",
        "# Title: Mucosal and systemic immune responses elicited by recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a fusion protein composed of pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin from Bordetella pertussis.\n# Abstract: We constructed a food-grade expression system harboring a F1S1 fusion protein of Bordetella pertussis to be produced in Lactococcus lactis NZ3900 as a new oral vaccine model against whooping cough, caused by B. pertussis. F1S1 was composed of N-terminally truncated S1 subunit of pertussis toxin and type I immunodominant domain of filamentous hemagglutinin which are both known as protective immunogens against pertussis. The recombinant L. lactis was administered via oral or intranasal routes to BALB/c mice and the related specific systemic and mucosal immune responses were then evaluated. The results indicated significantly higher levels of specific IgA in the lung extracts and IgG in sera of mucosally-immunized mice, compared to their controls. It was revealed that higher levels of IgG2a, compared to IgG1, were produced in all mucosally-immunized mice. Moreover, immunized mice developed Th1 responses with high levels of IFN-γ production by the spleen cells. These findings provide evidence for L. lactis to be used as a suitable vehicle for expression and delivery of F1S1 fusion protein to mucosa and induction of appropriate systemic and mucosal immune responses against pertussis.",
        "# Title: Rotavirus VP6 protein mucosally delivered by cell wall-derived particles from Lactococcus lactis induces protection against infection in a murine model.\n# Abstract: Rotaviruses are the primary cause of acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide. Although the implementation of live attenuated vaccines has reduced the number of rotavirus-associated deaths, variance in their effectiveness has been reported in different countries. This fact, among other concerns, leads to continuous efforts for the development of new generation of vaccines against rotavirus.In this work, we describe the obtention of cell wall-derived particles from a recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a cell wall-anchored version of the rotavirus VP6 protein. After confirming by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, flow cytometry and electronic immunomicroscopy that these particles were carrying the VP6 protein, their immunogenic potential was evaluated in adult BALB/c mice. For that, mucosal immunizations (oral or intranasal), with or without the dmLT [(double mutant Escherichia coli heat labile toxin LT(R192G/L211A)] adjuvant were performed. The results showed that these cell wall-derived particles were able to generate anti-rotavirus IgG and IgA antibodies only when administered intranasally, whether the adjuvant was present or not. However, the presence of dmLT was necessary to confer protection against rotavirus infection, which was evidenced by a 79.5 percent viral shedding reduction.In summary, this work describes the production of cell wall-derived particles which were able to induce a protective immune response after intranasal immunization. Further studies are needed to characterize the immune response elicited by these particles as well as to determine their potential as an alternative to the use of live L. lactis for mucosal antigen delivery.",

        "# Title: A Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB)-Based Vaccine Candidate for Human Norovirus.\n# Abstract: Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are responsible for more than 95% of the non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis epidemics in the world. The CDC estimates that every year 21 million individuals suffer from HuNoV-induced gastroenteritis in the United States. Currently, there is no FDA-approved vaccine for HuNoVs. Development of an effective vaccine has been hampered by the lack of an efficient cell culture system for HuNoVs and a suitable small animal model for pathogenesis study. In this study, we developed lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as a vector to deliver HuNoV antigen. A LAB strain (Lactococcus lactis) carrying VP1 gene of a HuNoV GII.4 virus (LAB-VP1) was constructed. It was found that HuNoV VP1 protein was highly expressed by LAB vector and was secreted into media supernatants. To test whether LAB-based HuNoV vaccine candidate is immunogenic, 4-day-old gnotobiotic piglets were orally inoculated with various doses of LAB-VP1. It was found that LABs were persistent in the small intestine of piglets and shed in pig feces for at least 25 days post inoculation. LAB DNA and VP1 were detected in mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen tissue in LAB-VP1 inoculated groups. HuNoV-specific IgG and IgA were detectable in serum and feces respectively at day 13 post-inoculation, and further increased at later time points. After being challenged with HuNoV GII.4 strain, a large amount of HuNoV antigens were observed in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum sections of the intestine in the LAB control group. In contrast, significantly less, or no, HuNoV antigens were detected in the LAB-VP1 immunized groups. Collectively, these results demonstrate that a LAB-based HuNoV vaccine induces protective immunity in gnotobiotic piglets.",

        "# Title: Mucosal Vaccination with Lactococcus lactis-Secreting Surface Immunological Protein Induces Humoral and Cellular Immune Protection against Group B Streptococcus in a Murine Model.\n# Abstract: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the primary etiological agent of sepsis and meningitis in newborns and is associated with premature birth and stillbirth. The development of a licensed vaccine is one of the pending challenges for the World Health Organization. Previously, we showed that oral immunization with surface immune protein (SIP) decreases vaginal colonization of GBS and generates functional opsonizing antibodies, which was determined by opsonophagocytic assays (OPA) in vitro. We also showed that the protein has an adjuvant vaccine profile. Therefore, an oral vaccine based on SIP may be an attractive alternative to employ in the development of new vaccines against GBS. Lactococcus lactis is a highlighted oral vaccine probiotic inducer of the mucosal immune response. This bacterium could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of an edible vaccine and has been used in clinical trials. In this study, we showed that an oral vaccine with a recombinant L. lactis strain secreting SIP from GBS (rL. lactis-SIP) can induce protective humoral and cellular immunity in an experimental model of GBS vaginal colonization in C57BL/6 mice. Mice immunized with rL. lactis-SIP were protected against clinical symptoms and bacterial colonization after GBS vaginal colonization. Our rL. lactis-SIP vaccine also induces an increase of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) specifically against SIP. The adoptive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice to naïve mice generated protection against GBS vaginal colonization. Moreover, the rL. lactis-SIP strain induces the activation of SIP-specific T cells, which could decrease GBS vaginal colonization and generate protective antibodies when transferred to other mice. Our experimental observations strongly support the notion that rL. lactis-SIP induces protective humoral and cellular immunity and could be considered as a novel alternative in the development of vaccines for GBS.",
        "# Title: Recombinant Lactococcus Lactis Displaying Omp31 Antigen of Brucella melitensis Can Induce an Immunogenic Response in BALB/c Mice.\n# Abstract: Since Brucella infection mostly occurs through the mucosal surfaces, immune response induced by vaccine that is delivered by a way of mucosal route can be drastically enhanced to control the brucellosis. Omp31is the major outer membrane protein of Brucella, and is considered as a protective antigen against Brucella infection. Accordingly, Lactococcus lactis has been used as an antigen-delivering vector to develop a vaccine-induced mucosal response for having a safer vaccination against brucellosis. A designed omp31 gene fused to the usp45 signal peptide and M6 cell wall anchor was sub cloned in the pNZ7021 expression vector, and a recombinant L. lactis displaying Omp31 was constructed. Omp31 protein expression was confirmed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. Animals were orally and intraperitoneally immunized with live or killed L. lactis expressing Omp31, respectively. The humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated by measuring the specific cytokines and antibodies. sIgA, serum IgA, IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in the mice immunized with live recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31 and also serum IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in mice immunized with killed recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31. Among IgG subtypes, IgG2a response was significantly higher in both groups compared to IgG1. In mice groups immunized with recombinant L. lactis, the IFN-γ and IL-10 level elevated; however, there was no change in the level of IL-4. These results indicated that recombinants L. lactis induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, and also vaccines based on L. lactis-derived live carriers are promising interventions against Brucella melitensis infections.",
        "# Title: Lactococcus lactis FNBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) Induces Cellular and Humoral Immune Responses After Oral Immunization of Mice.\n# Abstract: The development of a new vaccine strategy against tuberculosis is urgently needed and has been greatly encouraged by the scientific community worldwide. In this work, we constructed a lactococcal DNA vaccine based on the fusion of two Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens, ESAT-6 and Ag85A, and examined its immunogenicity. The coding sequences of the ESAT-6 and Ag85A genes were fused and cloned into the eukaryotic expression pValac vector, and the functionality of the vector was confirmed in vitro. Then, L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) was obtained and used for oral immunization of mice. This strain induced significant increases in IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-17 cytokines in stimulated splenocyte cultures, and significant production of antigen-specific sIgA was observed in the colonic tissues of immunized mice. We demonstrated that L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) generated a cellular and humoral immune response after oral immunization of mice.

Antigen display on lactic acid bacteria is a reliable approach for efficient oral vaccination and preventing bowel diseases. To develop an oral vaccine against ETEC, the gene of the binding domain from heat-labile toxin (LTB), a key ETEC virulence factor, was codon-optimized and cloned into a construct containing a signal peptide and an anchor for display on L. lactis. Bioinformatics analysis showed a codon adaptation index of 0.95 for the codon-optimized gene. Cell surface expression of LTB was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and blotting. White New Zealand rabbits were immunized per os (PO) with the recombinant L. lactis, and the antibody titers were assayed with ELISA. In vitro neutralization assay was performed using mouse adrenal tumor cells and rabbit ileal loop test was performed as the in vivo assay. ELISA results indicated that oral administration of the engineered L. lactis elicited a significant production of IgA in the intestine. In vitro neutralization assay showed that the effect of the toxin could be neutralized with 500 µg/ml of IgG isolated from the oral vaccine group. Furthermore, the dose of ETEC causing fluid accumulation in the ileal loop test showed a tenfold increase in rabbits immunized with either recombinant L. lactis or LTB protein compared to other groups. Our results imply that recombinant L. lactis could potentially be an effective live oral vaccine against ETEC toxicity.",
        "# Title: Oral Immunization of Mice with Cell Extracts from Recombinant Lactococcus lactis Expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein.\n# Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all over the world and became a pandemic that named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). At present, several intramuscular vaccines have been successfully developed and mass vaccination has progressed in many countries. The aim of the study is to develop and examine an oral vaccine against COVID-19 with recombinant Lactococcus lactis IL1403, a strain of lactic acid bacteria, expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) S1 subunit as an immunizing antigen. PBS or cell extracts from recombinant L. lactis were orally administered into mice (control VS treatment), and formation of antigen-specific antibodies and changes in the gut microbiome were analyzed. Intracellular antigen was detected, but its secretion was not successful. After immunization, antigen-specific serum IgG and fecal IgA levels were 1.5-fold (P = 0.002) and 1.4-fold (P = 0.016) higher in the immunized mice (treatment) than control, respectively. Gut microbiome profiles were clearly separated between the two groups when analyzed for beta diversity with overall similarity. At the genus level, while Coprococcus (P = 0.036) and unclassified genus of Ruminococcaceae (P = 0.037) in treatment were more abundant than control, rc4-4 (P = 0.013) and Stenotrophomonas (P = 0.021) were less abundant. Our results indicate that cell extract containing SARS-CoV-2 antigen can induce mice to produce antigen-specific antibodies without overall changes in the gut microbiome. This strategy may be useful for the development of other oral viral vaccines.",
        "# Title: Oral Immunization With a M Cell-Targeting Recombinant L. Lactis Vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE Stimulate Protective Immunity Against H. Pylori in Mice.\n# Abstract: There are many virulence factors of H. pylori that contribute in diverse ways to gastric disease. Therefore, designing multivalent epitope vaccines against many key virulence factors virulence factors of H. pylori is a promising strategy to control H. pylori infection. In previous studies, we constructed a multivalent epitope vaccine FVpE against four key virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), and oral immunization with the FVpE vaccine plus a polysaccharide adjuvant (PA) containing lycium barbarum polysaccharide and chitosan could provide protection against H. pylori infection in the Mongolian gerbil model. Oral vaccines have many advantages over injected vaccines, such as improved safety and compliance, and easier manufacturing and administration. However, the harsh gastrointestinal (GI) environment, such as gastric acid and proteolytic enzymes, limits the development of oral vaccines to some extent. Oral vaccines need a gastrointestinal delivery system with high safety, low price and promoting vaccine antigen to stimulate immune response in the gastrointestinal mucosa. Lactic acid bacteria are gastrointestinal probiotics that have unique advantages as a delivery system for oral vaccines. In this study, a M cell-targeting surface display system for L. lactis named plSAM was designed to help vaccine antigens to stimulate effective immune responses in the gastrointestinal tract, and a M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE was constructed by using the surface display system plSAM. recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE could secretively express the SAM-FVpE protein and display it on the bacterial surface. Moreover, experimental results confirmed that LL-plSAM-FVpE had an enhanced M cell-targeting property. In addition, LL-plSAM-FVpE had excellent M cell-targeting property to promote the phagocytosis and transport of the antigen SAM-FVpE by gastrointestinal M cells. More importantly, oral immunization of LL-plSAM-FVpE or SAM-FVpE plus PA can stimulate IgG and sIgA antibodies and CD4+ T cell immune responses against four virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), thus providing protective immunity against H. pylori infection in mice. The M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine against various key H. pylori virulence factors could be a promising vaccine candidate for controlling H. pylori infection.",
        "# Title: Oral and intranasal immunization with food-grade recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing high conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein triggers mice's immunity responses.\n# Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic began at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread throughout the world. Vaccination is still the most effective method of prevention of pathogenic infections, including viral infections. However, there is little evidence that vaccination can protect against SARS-CoV-2 virus for a long time. Thus, regular re-vaccination is necessary to control COVID-19. Vaccination by injection is invasive, and is one of the reasons people refuse to get re-vaccinated. Therefore, we developed a less invasive vaccine based on oral or nasal administration. The gene encoding the high conserved region (HCR) spike protein was inserted into pNZ8149 and expressed in L.lactis NZ3900. Mice were immunized at 3-week intervals with oral or nasal routes. Anti-SARS-CoV2 spike antibody (IgG and IgA) level were measured using ELISA method before and after treatment. Plasma cells population in lymph were analyzed using flowcytometry and the CD4 + and CD8 + cells in lymph and intestine were analyzed using immunofluorescence method. The results of nasal and oral administration in experimental animals showed that L.lactis carrying the HCR gene could induce a humoral immune response, as indicated by increased levels of IgG and IgA against SARS-CoV-2 (IgG/IgA-SARS-CoV-2). The plasma cell population after nasal and oral vaccination in mice were significantly different with control group (p < 0.05). The CD4 + and CD8 + cells in intestine were significantly higher in orally immunized group mice than control group. The CD8 + cells in lymph were significantly higher in intranasal immunized group mice than control group. Our data demonstrate L.lactis expressing spike protein can be developed into a less invasive alternative to nasal and oral vaccination.",
        "# Title: Expanding strain coverage of a group A Streptococcus pilus-expressing Lactococcus lactis mucosal vaccine.\n# Abstract: Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a human pathogenic bacterium that can trigger a wide range of diseases, including the autoimmune diseases acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, causing major morbidity and mortality in many low- and middle-income countries. Primary intervention programs have had limited success thus far, and a licensed vaccine has yet to be developed. The pilus of GAS is known to be involved in host cell adhesion, biofilm formation and immune evasion. We have a mucosal vaccine in development that expresses the pilus of GAS on the surface of the nonpathogenic bacterium Lactococcus lactis. To expand strain coverage, we combined seven L. lactis constructs, each expressing a different GAS pilus variant, and investigated the systemic and mucosal immune responses following immunization. Mice immunized with this combination showed specific immunoglobin G and immunoglobin A responses to the GAS pilus proteins of vaccine strains, at levels comparable to mice immunized with a single construct. Cross-reactivity to pilus proteins of nonvaccine strains was also evident. Furthermore, protective efficacy against a homologous strain of GAS in a murine nasopharyngeal colonization model was observed. Overall, this study provides further evidence for using pilus-expressing lactic acid bacteria as a vaccine to prevent upper respiratory tract GAS infections."

        "# Title: Accuracy of real-time shear wave elastography for assessing liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C: a pilot study.\n# Abstract: Real-time shear wave elastography (SWE) is a novel, noninvasive method to assess liver fibrosis by measuring liver stiffness. This single-center study was conducted to assess the accuracy of SWE in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), in comparison with transient elastography (TE), by using liver biopsy (LB) as the reference standard. Consecutive patients with CHC scheduled for LB by referring physicians were studied. One hundred and twenty-one patients met inclusion criteria. On the same day, real-time SWE using the ultrasound (US) system, Aixplorer (SuperSonic Imagine S.A., Aix-en-Provence, France), TE using FibroScan (Echosens, Paris, France), and US-assisted LB were consecutively performed. Fibrosis was staged according to the METAVIR scoring system. Analyses of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were performed to calculate optimal area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for F0-F1 versus F2-F4, F0- F2 versus F3-F4, and F0-F3 versus F4 for both real-time SWE and TE. Liver stiffness values increased in parallel with degree of liver fibrosis, both with SWE and TE. AUROCs were 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-0.96) for SWE and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.76-0.90) for TE (P = 0.002), 0.98 (95% CI: 0.94-1.00) for SWE and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.90-0.99) for TE (P = 0.14), and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.93-1.00) for SWE and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.91-0.99) for TE (P = 0.48), when comparing F0-F1 versus F2- F4, F0- F2 versus F3-F4, and F0 -F3 versus F4, respectively.",

Intra- and inter-operator reliability and repeatability were quantified in three different liver segments in a sample of 15 subjects, scanned during four independent sessions (two scans on day 1, two scans 1 wk later) by two operators. A total of 1440 measurements were made. Reproducibility was assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and a repeated measures analysis of variance. The shear wave speed was measured and used to estimate Young's modulus using the Supersonics Imagine Aixplorer. The median Young's modulus measured through the inter-costal space was 5.55 ± 0.74 kPa. The intra-operator reliability was better for same-day evaluations (ICC = 0.91) than the inter-operator reliability (ICC = 0.78). Intra-observer agreement decreased when scans were repeated on a different day. Inter-session repeatability was between 3.3% and 9.9% for intra-day repeated scans, compared with to 6.5%-12% for inter-day repeated scans. No significant difference was observed in subjects with a body mass index greater or less than 25 kg/m(2).",

With this index, the intra-observer acquisition variability assessed by comparing consecutive scans of the same patient was 17% and 32% for HG and LG clips, respectively. The measurement quantification variability assessed by comparing the measurements of a radiologist with those of a trained operator and of two automatic measurements on a same clip averaged 13% and 22% for HG and LG exams, respectively. It was found that SWE measurements depend greatly on the quality of the acquired data.

The rate of reliable liver stiffness measurements was significantly higher with 2-D SWE than with TE: 99.2% versus 74.8%, p < 0.0001 (different reliability criteria used, according to current recommendations). In univariate analysis, liver stiffness measured with 2-D SWE correlated best with fibrosis stage estimated with TE (r = 0.699, p < 0.0001), followed by Forns score (r = 0.534, p < 0.0001) and King's score (r = 0.512, p < 0.0001). However, in multivariate analysis, only 2-D SWE-measured values remained correlated with fibrosis stage (p < 0.0001). The optimal 2-D SWE cutoff values for predicting significant fibrosis were 8.03 kPa for fibrosis stage ≥2 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.832) and 13.1 kPa for fibrosis stage 4 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.915), respectively.

        "# Title: Assessment of liver fibrosis with 2-D shear wave elastography in comparison to transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse imaging in patients with chronic liver disease.\n# Abstract: Two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2-D SWE) is an ultrasound-based elastography method integrated into a conventional ultrasound machine. It can evaluate larger regions of interest and, therefore, might be better at determining the overall fibrosis distribution. The aim of this prospective study was to compare 2-D SWE with the two best evaluated liver elastography methods, transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse (point SWE using acoustic radiation force impulse) imaging, in the same population group. The study included 132 patients with chronic hepatopathies, in which liver stiffness was evaluated using transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging and 2-D SWE. The reference methods were liver biopsy for the assessment of liver fibrosis (n = 101) and magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography for the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis (n = 31). No significant difference in diagnostic accuracy, assessed as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), was found between the three elastography methods (2-D SWE, transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging) for the diagnosis of significant and advanced fibrosis and liver cirrhosis in the \"per protocol\" (AUROCs for fibrosis stages ≥2: 0.90, 0.95 and 0.91; for fibrosis stage [F] ≥3: 0.93, 0.95 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.92, 0.96 and 0.92) and \"intention to diagnose\" cohort (AUROCs for F ≥2: 0.87, 0.92 and 0.91; for F ≥3: 0.91, 0.93 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.88, 0.90 and 0.89).

The goal of this study was to assess the clinical use of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) evaluated by supersonic shear imaging (SSI), FibroScan, and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) in a cohort of NAFLD patients who underwent liver biopsy. A total of 291 NAFLD patients were prospectively enrolled from November 2011 to February 2015 at 2 French university hospitals. LSM was assessed by SSI, FibroScan (M probe), and ARFI within two weeks prior to liver biopsy. Calculations of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) were performed and compared for the staging of liver fibrosis. AUROC for SSI, FibroScan, and ARFI were 0.86, 0.82, and 0.77 for diagnoses of ≥F2; 0.89, 0.86, and 0.84 for ≥F3; and 0.88, 0.87, and 0.84 for F4, respectively. SSI had a higher accuracy than ARFI for diagnoses of significant fibrosis (≥F2) (P = 0.004). Clinical factors related to obesity such as body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2) , waist circumference ≥102 cm or increased parietal wall thickness were associated with LSM failures when using SSI or FibroScan and with unreliable results when using ARFI. In univariate analysis, FibroScan values were slightly correlated with NAFLD activity score and steatosis (R = 0.28 and 0.22, respectively), whereas SSI and ARFI were not; however, these components of NAFLD did not affect LSM results in multivariate analysis. The cutoff values for SSI and FibroScan for staging fibrosis with a sensitivity ≥90% were very close: 6.3/6.2 kPa for ≥F2, 8.3/8.2 kPa for ≥F3, and 10.5/9.5 kPa for F4.",

Results indicated that intra-modality repeatability was excellent for both techniques (GE 2-D-SWE: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.89 [0.84-0.93]; VTTQ: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.90 [0.86-0.93]). Intra-modality classification agreement for fibrosis grading was good to excellent (GE 2-D-SWE: κ = 0.65, VTTQ: κ = 0.82). However, inter-modality agreement for fibrosis grading was only fair (κ = 0.31) using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values of fibrosis. In conclusion, although both GE 2-D-SWE and Siemens VTTQ exhibit good to excellent intra-modality repeatability, inter-modality agreement is only fair, suggesting that these should not be used interchangeably.",

        "# Title: Long non-coding RNA NKILA inhibits migration and invasion of tongue squamous cell carcinoma cells via suppressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition.\n# Abstract: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged recently as key regulators of tumor development and progression. Our previous study identified an NF-KappaB interacting lncRNA (NKILA) which was negatively correlated with breast cancer metastasis and patient prognosis. However, its clinical significance and potential role in Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) remain unclear. Here we show that NKILA is down-regulated in TSCC cancer tissues than that in matched adjacent noncancerous tissues. And low NKILA expression in TSCC is significantly correlated with tumor metastasis and poor patient prognosis. In vitro, overexpression of NKILA decreases TSCC cells migration and invasion. Mechanistic study shows that NKILA inhibits the phosphorylation of IκBα and NF-κB activation as well as the induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Ectopic expression of NKILA in Tscca cells inhibits NF-κB activator TNF-α-promoted cell migration and invasion, while applying NF-κB inhibitor Bay-117082 or JSH-23 in NKILA silenced CAL27 cells reverses cell migration capacity to lower level. In vivo experimental metastasis model also demonstrates NKILA inhibits lung metastasis of NOD/SCID mice with TSCC tumors. These results suggested that NKILA is a vital determinant of TSCC migration and invasion and NF-κB signaling pathway mediates this effect. Given the above mentioned function of NKILA, it could act as a potential predictor for overall survival in patients with TSCC and a potential therapeutic target for TSCC intervention.",

However, the clinical significance and biological roles of NKILA in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remain unknown. In this study, we showed that NKILA was downregulated in ESCC tissues and cancer cells compared with their normal counterparts. Low NKILA expression correlated with large tumor size and advanced TNM stage, and predicted poor overall and disease-free survival of ESCC patients. Further loss- and gain-of-function assays indicated that NKILA inhibited proliferation and migration of ESCC cells in vitro, suppressed tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, NKILA could inhibit phosphorylation of IκBα, suppress p65 nuclear translocation and downregulate the expression of NF-κB target genes in ESCC cells. These results suggest NKILA could suppress malignant development of ESCC via abrogation of the NF-κB signaling and may potentially serve as a prognostic marker for ESCC.",
        "# Title: Long noncoding RNA NKILA enhances the anti-cancer effects of baicalein in hepatocellular carcinoma via the regulation of NF-κB signaling.\n# Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancer and leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Baicalein, a principle flavonoid, has shown attractive anti-cancer effects on HCC. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and influencing factors contributing to the anti-cancer effects of baicalein on HCC are still largely unknown. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been revealed to be fascinating therapeutic targets for cancers. The roles of NF-κB Interacting LncRNA (NKILA) are recently explored in several cancers. However, the expressions, clinical significances, roles and action mechanisms of NKILA in the anti-cancer effects of baicalein on HCC are unknown. In this study, we found that NKILA is down-regulated in HCC and reduced expression of NKILA indicts poor survival of HCC patients. Functional assays showed that overexpression of NKILA enhances the roles of baicalein on HCC cell proliferation inhibition, apoptosis induction, and migration inhibition in vitro and tumor growth suppression in vivo. Conversely, knockdown of NKILA suppresses the effects of baicalein. Mechanistically, we found that NKILA inhibits IκBα phosphorylation, NF-κB nuclear translocation, and NF-κB activity. NKILA also enhances the inhibitory effects of baicalein on NF-κB signaling. Furthermore, the effects of NKILA on baicalein-induced NF-κB activity inhibition, cell growth inhibition, apoptosis induction, and migration inhibition are reversed by NF-κB nuclear translocation inhibitor JSH-23. Collectively, our data demonstrated that NKILA enhances the anti-cancer effects of baicalein on HCC in vitro and in vivo via the regulation of NF-κB signaling, and implied that the combination of NKILA and baicalein would be potential therapeutic strategies for HCC.",
        "# Title: lncRNA-NKILA/NF-κB feedback loop modulates laryngeal cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and radioresistance.\n# Abstract: Laryngeal cancer is one of the most common head and neck malignant tumors and is commonly resistant to X-ray-based radiotherapy. NF-κB interacting lncRNA (NKILA) has been reported to serve as a tumor suppressor in several cancers through combining with NF-κB: IκB complex thereby inhibiting NF-κB activation. Herein, we demonstrated a low NKILA expression in laryngeal cancer and its correlation with shorter overall survival in patients with laryngeal cancer. NKILA serves as a tumor suppressor in laryngeal cancer by suppressing laryngeal cancer cell viability and migration, whereas promoting cell apoptosis; NKILA knockdown reverses the cytotoxicity of X-ray radiation on laryngeal cancer cells through combining with NF-κB: IκB complex to inhibit IκB phosphorylation, inhibit p65 nuclear translocation, and finally inhibit NF-κB activation. NF-κB binds to the promoter region of NKILA to activate its transcriptional activity, upregulated NKILA then inhibits IκB phosphorylation and NF-κB activation, thus forming a negative feedback loop to sensitize laryngeal cancer cell to X-ray radiation. In conclusion, NKILA can serve as a promising agent of enhancing the cytotoxicity of X-ray radiation on laryngeal cancer and addressing the radioresistance of laryngeal cancer.",

The association between NKILA expression and clinical variables including prognosis was estimated in rectal cancer patients. The gain-of-function study of NKILA in rectal cancer cell was conducted to evaluate the effect of NKILA on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and NF-κB signaling pathway. The results suggested NKILA expression was decreased in rectal cancer tissues and cells, and correlated with clinical stage, T classification, N classification and M classification. NKILA low-expression was an independent poor prognostic factor in rectal cancer patients. NKILA-inhibited rectal cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via suppressing NF-κB signaling.

        "# Title: Long non-coding RNA NKILA serves as a biomarker in the early diagnosis and prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer.\n# Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. The prognosis of patients with CRC at an advanced stage is poor. Biomarkers currently used in clinical practice, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen (CA) 19-9, lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity for early diagnosis and prediction, therefore there remains a requirement to improve the prognosis of patients with CRC. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been revealed to serve fundamental roles in various pathophysiological processes, including cancer initiation and progression. The present study investigated the expression and clinical significance of the lncRNA nuclear factor-κB interacting long non-coding RNA (NKILA) in CRC. It was identified that NKILA was downregulated in six CRC cell lines and tissues (n=173). Low NKILA expression was significantly associated with a poor differentiation grade, larger tumor size and advanced Tumor-Node-Metastases stages. Further statistical analyses revealed that low NKILA expression predicted poor overall survival (OS) rate and progression-free survival (PFS) rate. In addition, low NKILA expression was determined as an independent risk factor for poor OS and PFS. Furthermore, NKILA exhibited a relatively high sensitivity and specificity compared with CEA and CA19-9 in the early diagnosis of CRC. The serum level of NKILA was positively correlated with the level in tissues. In addition, a decreased NKILA level in serum was revealed to be partially restored post-operatively. In conclusion, low NKILA expression has been demonstrated to accelerate CRC progression and NKILA may be a potential novel biomarker in early diagnosis and prognosis of patients with CRC.",
        "# Title: NKILA, a prognostic indicator, inhibits tumor metastasis by suppressing NF-κB/Slug mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition in hepatocellular carcinoma.\n# Abstract: The metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the major obstacles hindering its therapeutic efficacy, leading to low surgical resection rate, high mortality and poor prognosis. Accumulating evidence has shown that both long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and NF-κB play vital roles in the regulation of cancer metastasis. However, the clinical significance and biological function of NKILA (NF-κB interacting lncRNA) and its interaction with NF-κB in HCC remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that NKILA was down-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines, and decreased NKILA expression was significantly associated with larger tumor size and positive vascular invasion in HCC patients. NKILA reduction was an independent risk factor of HCC patients' poor prognosis, and the 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of patients with low and high NKILA expression were 15.6% and 60.0%, respectively. Moreover, NKILA inhibits migration and invasion of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, NKILA prevents Slug/epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway via suppressing phosphorylation of IκBα, p65 nuclear translocation and NF-κB activation. In conclusion, these results indicate that NKILA might serve as an effective prognostic biomarker and a promising therapeutic target against HCC metastasis."

This study presents a summary of current understanding regarding the clonal relatedness of mutated genes in primary cutaneous melanoma and matched tumors. We draw attention to the knowledge gap regarding the genetic heterogeneity of melanoma-specific genes, which could serve as a valuable tool in identifying suitable patients for trials testing possible new targeted therapies. Furthermore, we found that CM presents a significant concordance in BRAF status between primary and metastatic tumors than in previous meta-analyses, probably due to technical advances, although a minority of patients showed inconsistencies. Therefore, we propose that molecular testing in metastatic tissue is a more appropriate method for determining BRAF status to tailor the treatment decision, although it is still reasonable to use the primary tumor in cases of difficulty. Further research should investigate the factors causing these discrepancies and the feasibility of using other molecular markers with BRAF status to better stratify patients for melanoma treatment.",

        "# Title: Intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity of BRAF(V600E))mutations in primary and metastatic melanoma.\n# Abstract: The rationale for using small molecule inhibitors of oncogenic proteins as cancer therapies depends, at least in part, on the assumption that metastatic tumors are primarily clonal with respect to mutant oncogene. With the emergence of BRAF(V600E) as a therapeutic target, we investigated intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity in melanoma using detection of the BRAF(V600E) mutation as a marker of clonality. BRAF mutant-specific PCR (MS-PCR) and conventional sequencing were performed on 112 tumors from 73 patients, including patients with matched primary and metastatic specimens (n = 18). Nineteen patients had tissues available from multiple metastatic sites. Mutations were detected in 36/112 (32%) melanomas using conventional sequencing, and 85/112 (76%) using MS-PCR. The better sensitivity of the MS-PCR to detect the mutant BRAF(V600E) allele was not due to the presence of contaminating normal tissue, suggesting that the tumor was comprised of subclones of differing BRAF genotypes. To determine if tumor subclones were present in individual primary melanomas, we performed laser microdissection and mutation detection via sequencing and BRAF(V600E)-specific SNaPshot analysis in 9 cases. Six of these cases demonstrated differing proportions of BRAF(V600E)and BRAF(wild-type) cells in distinct microdissected regions within individual tumors. Additional analyses of multiple metastatic samples from individual patients using the highly sensitive MS-PCR without microdissection revealed that 5/19 (26%) patients had metastases that were discordant for the BRAF(V600E) mutation. In conclusion, we used highly sensitive BRAF mutation detection methods and observed substantial evidence for heterogeneity of the BRAF(V600E) mutation within individual melanoma tumor specimens, and among multiple specimens from individual patients. Given the varied clinical responses of patients to BRAF inhibitor therapy, these data suggest that additional studies to determine possible associations between clinical outcomes and intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity could prove fruitful.",

        "# Title: Discordancy in BRAF mutations among primary and metastatic melanoma lesions: clinical implications for targeted therapy.\n# Abstract: Systemic targeted molecular therapy, in the form of a selective BRAF inhibitor with or without a MEK inhibitor, is a standard treatment for patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma with unresectable stage III and IV disease. Patients with BRAF mutation-negative primary tumors may manifest BRAF mutation-positive metastatic disease. It is unclear whether all metastatic lesions carry the same BRAF mutation status found in the primary tumor and if discordancy exists, in what frequency it occurs. Primary and matched metastatic lesions in 25 melanoma patients were tested for the BRAF V600E/Ec, V600K, V600D, and V600R mutations using a BRAF RGQ PCR kit (Qiagen). Four patients (16%) had discrepancies between their primary and metastatic melanoma BRAF status. Of these patients, 2 (8%) had BRAF mutation-positive primary melanomas with BRAF mutation-negative metastatic lesions and 2 (8%) patient had BRAF mutation-negative melanoma with a BRAF mutation-positive metastatic lesion. In summary, discordancy of BRAF mutation status is not an infrequent finding between primary and metastatic melanoma. It may be prudent in previously negative patients to determine BRAF mutation status of new metastatic tumors for proper allocation of BRAF inhibitor therapy. Discordant BRAF status may have a role in the varying patterns of response and inevitable resistance seen with BRAF inhibitor therapies.",

Nevertheless, BRAF oncogene mutation status between different samples from the same patient has been studied with conflicting results. This study investigated the intrapatient homogeneity of BRAF mutation status using pyrosequencing in primary tumors and different metastatic sites of melanoma patients. Paired samples of lymphatic, visceral, and subcutaneous metastases and primary melanoma from 45 metastatic melanoma patients were tested for BRAF mutations using a pyrosequencing assay and by Sanger sequencing. Overall, sequencing for BRAF mutation status was performed in 114 paired samples from 45 patients. Eighteen patients (40%) carried a BRAF mutation, including BRAF V600E (12/18), BRAF V600K (5/18), and BRAF V600R (1/18) mutations. Multiple BRAF mutations (V600E and V600K) were found in one patient. Among the patients with BRAF mutations, a good agreement in BRAF mutation status was found between the first and second tumor samples genotyped (91%; Cohen's κ coefficient: 0.81). Discordance in BRAF mutation status was found only in four patients, involving all three patients in whom sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases were sampled. These SLNs exhibited a wild-type genotype and were discordant with the other BRAF-mutated samples found in the same patient. The intrapatient BRAF status was predominantly homogeneous. However, SLN genotyping using pyrosequencing might be inaccurate in determining the actual mutation status of melanoma. Further studies are required to confirm the lack of reliability of SLN.",

Treatment with BRAFV600 inhibitors has improved overall and disease-free survival in metastatic melanoma patients whose tumors harbor BRAFV600 mutations. Although the BRAFV600E mutation appears to have a critical role in tumor initiation, its expression during tumor progression remains controversial. In fact, various authors claim that BRAFV600E heterogeneity is evident in melanoma tumors. Herein, we investigated the pattern of BRAFV600E expression in matched primary and metastatic samples from 140 patients. Using a combination of real-time PCR and immunohistochemical analyses, we demonstrated that BRAFV600E expression is homogeneous in melanoma tumors and hypothesized that the heterogeneity described by others might be attributable to technical issues when molecular methods are used. We also demonstrated the high efficiency of the anti-BRAFV600E VE1 antibody for the detection of BRAFV600E mutations in melanoma tumors.",

BRAF mutation frequency ranges from 40 to 60% depending on melanoma clinical characteristics and detection technique used.Intertumoral heterogeneity could lead to misinterpretation of BRAF mutational status; this is especially important if testing is performed on primary specimens, when metastatic lesions are unavailable.Aim of this study was to identify the best combination of methods for detecting BRAF mutations (among peptide nucleic acid - PNA-clamping real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and capillary sequencing) and investigate BRAF mutation heterogeneity in a series of 100 primary melanomas and a subset of 25 matched metastatic samples.Overall, we obtained a BRAF mutation frequency of 62%, based on the combination of at least two techniques. Concordance between mutation status in primary and metastatic tumor was good but not complete (67%), when agreement of at least two techniques were considered. Next generation sequencing was used to quantify the threshold of detected mutant alleles in discordant samples. Combining different methods excludes that the observed heterogeneity is technique-based. We propose an algorithm for BRAF mutation testing based on agreement between immunohistochemistry and PNA; a third molecular method could be added in case of discordance of the results. Testing the primary tumor when the metastatic sample is unavailable is a good option if at least two methods of detection are used, however the presence of intertumoral heterogeneity or the occurrence of additional primaries should be carefully considered.",

Between 40% and 60% of melanomas demonstrate BRAF mutations, BRAF V600E being most common. Selective BRAF inhibitor therapy has shown improvement in outcome in patients with melanoma. It has been demonstrated that not all metastatic lesions carry the same BRAF mutation status as the primary, but the frequency in which discordance occurs remains unclear. Establishing this may have implications in the use of BRAF inhibitors in patients with melanoma brain metastases.Patients who underwent metastectomy for melanoma brain metastases were identified using our local histopathology database. A review of histology of the primary lesion and the metastasis was performed for each patient, assessing for BRAF mutation status discordance.Fourty-two patients who underwent a brain metastectomy following excision of a melanoma primary were identified over a 7-year period. Median survival was 9 months. The median Breslow thickness for the primary lesion was 3.4 mm. Six patients (14%) had discrepancy between the BRAF status of a melanoma primary and metastatic lesion. Of these 6 patients, 3 had a BRAF mutation positive primary with a BRAF mutation negative metastatic lesion, while the other 3 had a BRAF mutation negative primary with BRAF mutation positive metastasis.There is an important discordance rate in the BRAF mutation status of melanoma primaries versus brain metastases.",

Given this, the objective of the current study was to ascertain concordance of somatic mutations in BRAF/NRAS/TERT and immunohistochemical PD-L1 and CD8 in matched primary cutaneous and metastatic melanoma. A total of 43 archival paired samples with sufficient material for genetic and immunohistochemical analyses met the criteria for inclusion in the study. Immunohistochemistry was performed for PD-L1 and CD8 and direct-DNA Sanger sequencing for BRAF/NRAS/TERT promoter mutational analyses. Agreement between paired samples was assessed using Cohen κ.

Melanoma with extreme histomorphologic heterogeneity can pose a diagnostic challenge in which the diagnosis may predominantly rely on its immunophenotypic profile. However, tumor survival and response to therapy are linked to tumor genetic heterogeneity rather than tumor morphology. Therefore, understating the molecular characteristics of such melanomas become indispensable. In this study, DNA was extracted from 11 morphologically distinct regions in eight formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded melanomas. In each region, mutations in 50 cancer-related genes were tested using next-generation sequencing (NGS). A tumor was considered genetically heterogeneous if at least one non-overlapping mutation was identified either between the histologically distinct regions of the same tumor (intratumor heterogeneity) or among the histologically distinct regions of the paired primary and metastatic tumors within the same patient (intertumor heterogeneity). Our results revealed that genetic heterogeneity existed in all tumors as non-overlapping mutations were detected in every tested tumor (n = 5, 100%; intratumor: n = 2, 40%; intertumor: n = 3, 60%). Conversely, overlapping mutations were also detected in all the tested regions (n = 11, 100%).

      "referenceConclusion": "The complete explanation of the genomic background behind melanoma pathogenesis remains elusive. This study presents a summary of current understanding regarding the clonal relatedness of mutated genes in primary cutaneous melanoma and matched tumors. We draw attention to the knowledge gap regarding the genetic heterogeneity of melanoma-specific genes, which could serve as a valuable tool in identifying suitable patients for trials testing possible new targeted therapies. Furthermore, we found that CM presents a significant concordance in BRAF status between primary and metastatic tumors than in previous meta-analyses, probably due to technical advances, although a minority of patients showed inconsistencies. Therefore, we propose that molecular testing in metastatic tissue is a more appropriate method for determining BRAF status to tailor the treatment decision, although it is still reasonable to use the primary tumor in cases of difficulty. Further research should investigate the factors causing these discrepancies and the feasibility of using other molecular markers with BRAF status to better stratify patients for melanoma treatment.",

        "# Title: Intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity of BRAF(V600E))mutations in primary and metastatic melanoma.\n# Abstract: The rationale for using small molecule inhibitors of oncogenic proteins as cancer therapies depends, at least in part, on the assumption that metastatic tumors are primarily clonal with respect to mutant oncogene. With the emergence of BRAF(V600E) as a therapeutic target, we investigated intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity in melanoma using detection of the BRAF(V600E) mutation as a marker of clonality. BRAF mutant-specific PCR (MS-PCR) and conventional sequencing were performed on 112 tumors from 73 patients, including patients with matched primary and metastatic specimens (n = 18). Nineteen patients had tissues available from multiple metastatic sites. Mutations were detected in 36/112 (32%) melanomas using conventional sequencing, and 85/112 (76%) using MS-PCR. The better sensitivity of the MS-PCR to detect the mutant BRAF(V600E) allele was not due to the presence of contaminating normal tissue, suggesting that the tumor was comprised of subclones of differing BRAF genotypes. To determine if tumor subclones were present in individual primary melanomas, we performed laser microdissection and mutation detection via sequencing and BRAF(V600E)-specific SNaPshot analysis in 9 cases. Six of these cases demonstrated differing proportions of BRAF(V600E)and BRAF(wild-type) cells in distinct microdissected regions within individual tumors. Additional analyses of multiple metastatic samples from individual patients using the highly sensitive MS-PCR without microdissection revealed that 5/19 (26%) patients had metastases that were discordant for the BRAF(V600E) mutation. In conclusion, we used highly sensitive BRAF mutation detection methods and observed substantial evidence for heterogeneity of the BRAF(V600E) mutation within individual melanoma tumor specimens, and among multiple specimens from individual patients. Given the varied clinical responses of patients to BRAF inhibitor therapy, these data suggest that additional studies to determine possible associations between clinical outcomes and intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity could prove fruitful.",

        "# Title: Discordancy in BRAF mutations among primary and metastatic melanoma lesions: clinical implications for targeted therapy.\n# Abstract: Systemic targeted molecular therapy, in the form of a selective BRAF inhibitor with or without a MEK inhibitor, is a standard treatment for patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma with unresectable stage III and IV disease. Patients with BRAF mutation-negative primary tumors may manifest BRAF mutation-positive metastatic disease. It is unclear whether all metastatic lesions carry the same BRAF mutation status found in the primary tumor and if discordancy exists, in what frequency it occurs. Primary and matched metastatic lesions in 25 melanoma patients were tested for the BRAF V600E/Ec, V600K, V600D, and V600R mutations using a BRAF RGQ PCR kit (Qiagen). Four patients (16%) had discrepancies between their primary and metastatic melanoma BRAF status. Of these patients, 2 (8%) had BRAF mutation-positive primary melanomas with BRAF mutation-negative metastatic lesions and 2 (8%) patient had BRAF mutation-negative melanoma with a BRAF mutation-positive metastatic lesion. In summary, discordancy of BRAF mutation status is not an infrequent finding between primary and metastatic melanoma. It may be prudent in previously negative patients to determine BRAF mutation status of new metastatic tumors for proper allocation of BRAF inhibitor therapy. Discordant BRAF status may have a role in the varying patterns of response and inevitable resistance seen with BRAF inhibitor therapies.",

Nevertheless, BRAF oncogene mutation status between different samples from the same patient has been studied with conflicting results. This study investigated the intrapatient homogeneity of BRAF mutation status using pyrosequencing in primary tumors and different metastatic sites of melanoma patients. Paired samples of lymphatic, visceral, and subcutaneous metastases and primary melanoma from 45 metastatic melanoma patients were tested for BRAF mutations using a pyrosequencing assay and by Sanger sequencing. Overall, sequencing for BRAF mutation status was performed in 114 paired samples from 45 patients. Eighteen patients (40%) carried a BRAF mutation, including BRAF V600E (12/18), BRAF V600K (5/18), and BRAF V600R (1/18) mutations. Multiple BRAF mutations (V600E and V600K) were found in one patient. Among the patients with BRAF mutations, a good agreement in BRAF mutation status was found between the first and second tumor samples genotyped (91%; Cohen's κ coefficient: 0.81). Discordance in BRAF mutation status was found only in four patients, involving all three patients in whom sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases were sampled. These SLNs exhibited a wild-type genotype and were discordant with the other BRAF-mutated samples found in the same patient. The intrapatient BRAF status was predominantly homogeneous. However, SLN genotyping using pyrosequencing might be inaccurate in determining the actual mutation status of melanoma. Further studies are required to confirm the lack of reliability of SLN.",

Treatment with BRAFV600 inhibitors has improved overall and disease-free survival in metastatic melanoma patients whose tumors harbor BRAFV600 mutations. Although the BRAFV600E mutation appears to have a critical role in tumor initiation, its expression during tumor progression remains controversial. In fact, various authors claim that BRAFV600E heterogeneity is evident in melanoma tumors. Herein, we investigated the pattern of BRAFV600E expression in matched primary and metastatic samples from 140 patients. Using a combination of real-time PCR and immunohistochemical analyses, we demonstrated that BRAFV600E expression is homogeneous in melanoma tumors and hypothesized that the heterogeneity described by others might be attributable to technical issues when molecular methods are used.

BRAF mutation frequency ranges from 40 to 60% depending on melanoma clinical characteristics and detection technique used.Intertumoral heterogeneity could lead to misinterpretation of BRAF mutational status; this is especially important if testing is performed on primary specimens, when metastatic lesions are unavailable.Aim of this study was to identify the best combination of methods for detecting BRAF mutations (among peptide nucleic acid - PNA-clamping real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and capillary sequencing) and investigate BRAF mutation heterogeneity in a series of 100 primary melanomas and a subset of 25 matched metastatic samples.Overall, we obtained a BRAF mutation frequency of 62%, based on the combination of at least two techniques. Concordance between mutation status in primary and metastatic tumor was good but not complete (67%), when agreement of at least two techniques were considered. Next generation sequencing was used to quantify the threshold of detected mutant alleles in discordant samples. Combining different methods excludes that the observed heterogeneity is technique-based. We propose an algorithm for BRAF mutation testing based on agreement between immunohistochemistry and PNA; a third molecular method could be added in case of discordance of the results.

Between 40% and 60% of melanomas demonstrate BRAF mutations, BRAF V600E being most common. Selective BRAF inhibitor therapy has shown improvement in outcome in patients with melanoma. It has been demonstrated that not all metastatic lesions carry the same BRAF mutation status as the primary, but the frequency in which discordance occurs remains unclear. Establishing this may have implications in the use of BRAF inhibitors in patients with melanoma brain metastases.Patients who underwent metastectomy for melanoma brain metastases were identified using our local histopathology database. A review of histology of the primary lesion and the metastasis was performed for each patient, assessing for BRAF mutation status discordance.Fourty-two patients who underwent a brain metastectomy following excision of a melanoma primary were identified over a 7-year period. Median survival was 9 months. The median Breslow thickness for the primary lesion was 3.4 mm. Six patients (14%) had discrepancy between the BRAF status of a melanoma primary and metastatic lesion. Of these 6 patients, 3 had a BRAF mutation positive primary with a BRAF mutation negative metastatic lesion, while the other 3 had a BRAF mutation negative primary with BRAF mutation positive metastasis.There is an important discordance rate in the BRAF mutation status of melanoma primaries versus brain metastases.",

Given this, the objective of the current study was to ascertain concordance of somatic mutations in BRAF/NRAS/TERT and immunohistochemical PD-L1 and CD8 in matched primary cutaneous and metastatic melanoma.

While generally observed as homogeneous, evidence of intra-tumor heterogeneity within individual primary or metastatic lesions has also been documented, suggesting the presence of subclones with differing BRAF genotypes."

        "# Title: Long non-coding RNA NKILA inhibits migration and invasion of tongue squamous cell carcinoma cells via suppressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition.\n# Abstract: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged recently as key regulators of tumor development and progression. Our previous study identified an NF-KappaB interacting lncRNA (NKILA) which was negatively correlated with breast cancer metastasis and patient prognosis. However, its clinical significance and potential role in Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) remain unclear. Here we show that NKILA is down-regulated in TSCC cancer tissues than that in matched adjacent noncancerous tissues. And low NKILA expression in TSCC is significantly correlated with tumor metastasis and poor patient prognosis. In vitro, overexpression of NKILA decreases TSCC cells migration and invasion. Mechanistic study shows that NKILA inhibits the phosphorylation of IκBα and NF-κB activation as well as the induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Ectopic expression of NKILA in Tscca cells inhibits NF-κB activator TNF-α-promoted cell migration and invasion, while applying NF-κB inhibitor Bay-117082 or JSH-23 in NKILA silenced CAL27 cells reverses cell migration capacity to lower level. In vivo experimental metastasis model also demonstrates NKILA inhibits lung metastasis of NOD/SCID mice with TSCC tumors. These results suggested that NKILA is a vital determinant of TSCC migration and invasion and NF-κB signaling pathway mediates this effect. Given the above mentioned function of NKILA, it could act as a potential predictor for overall survival in patients with TSCC and a potential therapeutic target for TSCC intervention.",

        "# Title: NKILA inhibits NF-κB signaling and suppresses tumor metastasis.\n# Abstract: The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) NKILA (nuclear transcription factor NF-κB interacting lncRNA) functions as a suppressor in human breast cancer and tongue cancer. However, the clinical significance and biological roles of NKILA in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remain unknown. In this study, we showed that NKILA was downregulated in ESCC tissues and cancer cells compared with their normal counterparts. Low NKILA expression correlated with large tumor size and advanced TNM stage, and predicted poor overall and disease-free survival of ESCC patients. Further loss- and gain-of-function assays indicated that NKILA inhibited proliferation and migration of ESCC cells in vitro, suppressed tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, NKILA could inhibit phosphorylation of IκBα, suppress p65 nuclear translocation and downregulate the expression of NF-κB target genes in ESCC cells. These results suggest NKILA could suppress malignant development of ESCC via abrogation of the NF-κB signaling and may potentially serve as a prognostic marker for ESCC.",
        "# Title: Long noncoding RNA NKILA enhances the anti-cancer effects of baicalein in hepatocellular carcinoma via the regulation of NF-κB signaling.\n# Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancer and leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Baicalein, a principle flavonoid, has shown attractive anti-cancer effects on HCC. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and influencing factors contributing to the anti-cancer effects of baicalein on HCC are still largely unknown. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been revealed to be fascinating therapeutic targets for cancers. The roles of NF-κB Interacting LncRNA (NKILA) are recently explored in several cancers. However, the expressions, clinical significances, roles and action mechanisms of NKILA in the anti-cancer effects of baicalein on HCC are unknown. In this study, we found that NKILA is down-regulated in HCC and reduced expression of NKILA indicts poor survival of HCC patients. Functional assays showed that overexpression of NKILA enhances the roles of baicalein on HCC cell proliferation inhibition, apoptosis induction, and migration inhibition in vitro and tumor growth suppression in vivo. Conversely, knockdown of NKILA suppresses the effects of baicalein. Mechanistically, we found that NKILA inhibits IκBα phosphorylation, NF-κB nuclear translocation, and NF-κB activity. NKILA also enhances the inhibitory effects of baicalein on NF-κB signaling. Furthermore, the effects of NKILA on baicalein-induced NF-κB activity inhibition, cell growth inhibition, apoptosis induction, and migration inhibition are reversed by NF-κB nuclear translocation inhibitor JSH-23. Collectively, our data demonstrated that NKILA enhances the anti-cancer effects of baicalein on HCC in vitro and in vivo via the regulation of NF-κB signaling, and implied that the combination of NKILA and baicalein would be potential therapeutic strategies for HCC.",
        "# Title: lncRNA-NKILA/NF-κB feedback loop modulates laryngeal cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and radioresistance.\n# Abstract: Laryngeal cancer is one of the most common head and neck malignant tumors and is commonly resistant to X-ray-based radiotherapy. NF-κB interacting lncRNA (NKILA) has been reported to serve as a tumor suppressor in several cancers through combining with NF-κB: IκB complex thereby inhibiting NF-κB activation. Herein, we demonstrated a low NKILA expression in laryngeal cancer and its correlation with shorter overall survival in patients with laryngeal cancer. NKILA serves as a tumor suppressor in laryngeal cancer by suppressing laryngeal cancer cell viability and migration, whereas promoting cell apoptosis; NKILA knockdown reverses the cytotoxicity of X-ray radiation on laryngeal cancer cells through combining with NF-κB: IκB complex to inhibit IκB phosphorylation, inhibit p65 nuclear translocation, and finally inhibit NF-κB activation. NF-κB binds to the promoter region of NKILA to activate its transcriptional activity, upregulated NKILA then inhibits IκB phosphorylation and NF-κB activation, thus forming a negative feedback loop to sensitize laryngeal cancer cell to X-ray radiation. In conclusion, NKILA can serve as a promising agent of enhancing the cytotoxicity of X-ray radiation on laryngeal cancer and addressing the radioresistance of laryngeal cancer.",

However, the role of NKILA in rectal cancer is still unknown. The objective of this study is to investigate the clinical value and biological function of NKILA in rectal cancer. The association between NKILA expression and clinical variables including prognosis was estimated in rectal cancer patients. The gain-of-function study of NKILA in rectal cancer cell was conducted to evaluate the effect of NKILA on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and NF-κB signaling pathway. The results suggested NKILA expression was decreased in rectal cancer tissues and cells, and correlated with clinical stage, T classification, N classification and M classification. NKILA low-expression was an independent poor prognostic factor in rectal cancer patients. NKILA-inhibited rectal cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via suppressing NF-κB signaling. In conclusion, NKILA serves as an antioncogenic lncRNA in rectal cancer.",

        "# Title: Long non-coding RNA NKILA serves as a biomarker in the early diagnosis and prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer.\n# Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. The prognosis of patients with CRC at an advanced stage is poor. Biomarkers currently used in clinical practice, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen (CA) 19-9, lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity for early diagnosis and prediction, therefore there remains a requirement to improve the prognosis of patients with CRC. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been revealed to serve fundamental roles in various pathophysiological processes, including cancer initiation and progression. The present study investigated the expression and clinical significance of the lncRNA nuclear factor-κB interacting long non-coding RNA (NKILA) in CRC. It was identified that NKILA was downregulated in six CRC cell lines and tissues (n=173). Low NKILA expression was significantly associated with a poor differentiation grade, larger tumor size and advanced Tumor-Node-Metastases stages. Further statistical analyses revealed that low NKILA expression predicted poor overall survival (OS) rate and progression-free survival (PFS) rate. In addition, low NKILA expression was determined as an independent risk factor for poor OS and PFS. Furthermore, NKILA exhibited a relatively high sensitivity and specificity compared with CEA and CA19-9 in the early diagnosis of CRC. The serum level of NKILA was positively correlated with the level in tissues. In addition, a decreased NKILA level in serum was revealed to be partially restored post-operatively. In conclusion, low NKILA expression has been demonstrated to accelerate CRC progression and NKILA may be a potential novel biomarker in early diagnosis and prognosis of patients with CRC.",
        "# Title: NKILA, a prognostic indicator, inhibits tumor metastasis by suppressing NF-κB/Slug mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition in hepatocellular carcinoma.\n# Abstract: The metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the major obstacles hindering its therapeutic efficacy, leading to low surgical resection rate, high mortality and poor prognosis. Accumulating evidence has shown that both long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and NF-κB play vital roles in the regulation of cancer metastasis. However, the clinical significance and biological function of NKILA (NF-κB interacting lncRNA) and its interaction with NF-κB in HCC remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that NKILA was down-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines, and decreased NKILA expression was significantly associated with larger tumor size and positive vascular invasion in HCC patients. NKILA reduction was an independent risk factor of HCC patients' poor prognosis, and the 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of patients with low and high NKILA expression were 15.6% and 60.0%, respectively. Moreover, NKILA inhibits migration and invasion of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, NKILA prevents Slug/epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway via suppressing phosphorylation of IκBα, p65 nuclear translocation and NF-κB activation. In conclusion, these results indicate that NKILA might serve as an effective prognostic biomarker and a promising therapeutic target against HCC metastasis."

      "referenceConclusion": "The complete explanation of the genomic background behind melanoma pathogenesis remains elusive. This study presents a summary of current understanding regarding the clonal relatedness of mutated genes in primary cutaneous melanoma and matched tumors. We draw attention to the knowledge gap regarding the genetic heterogeneity of melanoma-specific genes, which could serve as a valuable tool in identifying suitable patients for trials testing possible new targeted therapies. Furthermore, we found that CM presents a significant concordance in BRAF status between primary and metastatic tumors than in previous meta-analyses, probably due to technical advances, although a minority of patients showed inconsistencies. Therefore, we propose that molecular testing in metastatic tissue is a more appropriate method for determining BRAF status to tailor the treatment decision, although it is still reasonable to use the primary tumor in cases of difficulty. Further research should investigate the factors causing these discrepancies and the feasibility of using other molecular markers with BRAF status to better stratify patients for melanoma treatment.",

        "# Title: Intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity of BRAF(V600E))mutations in primary and metastatic melanoma.\n# Abstract: The rationale for using small molecule inhibitors of oncogenic proteins as cancer therapies depends, at least in part, on the assumption that metastatic tumors are primarily clonal with respect to mutant oncogene. With the emergence of BRAF(V600E) as a therapeutic target, we investigated intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity in melanoma using detection of the BRAF(V600E) mutation as a marker of clonality. BRAF mutant-specific PCR (MS-PCR) and conventional sequencing were performed on 112 tumors from 73 patients, including patients with matched primary and metastatic specimens (n = 18). Nineteen patients had tissues available from multiple metastatic sites. Mutations were detected in 36/112 (32%) melanomas using conventional sequencing, and 85/112 (76%) using MS-PCR. The better sensitivity of the MS-PCR to detect the mutant BRAF(V600E) allele was not due to the presence of contaminating normal tissue, suggesting that the tumor was comprised of subclones of differing BRAF genotypes. To determine if tumor subclones were present in individual primary melanomas, we performed laser microdissection and mutation detection via sequencing and BRAF(V600E)-specific SNaPshot analysis in 9 cases. Six of these cases demonstrated differing proportions of BRAF(V600E)and BRAF(wild-type) cells in distinct microdissected regions within individual tumors. Additional analyses of multiple metastatic samples from individual patients using the highly sensitive MS-PCR without microdissection revealed that 5/19 (26%) patients had metastases that were discordant for the BRAF(V600E) mutation. In conclusion, we used highly sensitive BRAF mutation detection methods and observed substantial evidence for heterogeneity of the BRAF(V600E) mutation within individual melanoma tumor specimens, and among multiple specimens from individual patients. Given the varied clinical responses of patients to BRAF inhibitor therapy, these data suggest that additional studies to determine possible associations between clinical outcomes and intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity could prove fruitful.",

        "# Title: Discordancy in BRAF mutations among primary and metastatic melanoma lesions: clinical implications for targeted therapy.\n# Abstract: Systemic targeted molecular therapy, in the form of a selective BRAF inhibitor with or without a MEK inhibitor, is a standard treatment for patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma with unresectable stage III and IV disease. Patients with BRAF mutation-negative primary tumors may manifest BRAF mutation-positive metastatic disease. It is unclear whether all metastatic lesions carry the same BRAF mutation status found in the primary tumor and if discordancy exists, in what frequency it occurs. Primary and matched metastatic lesions in 25 melanoma patients were tested for the BRAF V600E/Ec, V600K, V600D, and V600R mutations using a BRAF RGQ PCR kit (Qiagen). Four patients (16%) had discrepancies between their primary and metastatic melanoma BRAF status. Of these patients, 2 (8%) had BRAF mutation-positive primary melanomas with BRAF mutation-negative metastatic lesions and 2 (8%) patient had BRAF mutation-negative melanoma with a BRAF mutation-positive metastatic lesion. In summary, discordancy of BRAF mutation status is not an infrequent finding between primary and metastatic melanoma. It may be prudent in previously negative patients to determine BRAF mutation status of new metastatic tumors for proper allocation of BRAF inhibitor therapy. Discordant BRAF status may have a role in the varying patterns of response and inevitable resistance seen with BRAF inhibitor therapies.",

Nevertheless, BRAF oncogene mutation status between different samples from the same patient has been studied with conflicting results. This study investigated the intrapatient homogeneity of BRAF mutation status using pyrosequencing in primary tumors and different metastatic sites of melanoma patients. Paired samples of lymphatic, visceral, and subcutaneous metastases and primary melanoma from 45 metastatic melanoma patients were tested for BRAF mutations using a pyrosequencing assay and by Sanger sequencing. Overall, sequencing for BRAF mutation status was performed in 114 paired samples from 45 patients. Eighteen patients (40%) carried a BRAF mutation, including BRAF V600E (12/18), BRAF V600K (5/18), and BRAF V600R (1/18) mutations. Multiple BRAF mutations (V600E and V600K) were found in one patient. Among the patients with BRAF mutations, a good agreement in BRAF mutation status was found between the first and second tumor samples genotyped (91%; Cohen's κ coefficient: 0.81). Discordance in BRAF mutation status was found only in four patients, involving all three patients in whom sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases were sampled. These SLNs exhibited a wild-type genotype and were discordant with the other BRAF-mutated samples found in the same patient. The intrapatient BRAF status was predominantly homogeneous. However, SLN genotyping using pyrosequencing might be inaccurate in determining the actual mutation status of melanoma. Further studies are required to confirm the lack of reliability of SLN.",

Treatment with BRAFV600 inhibitors has improved overall and disease-free survival in metastatic melanoma patients whose tumors harbor BRAFV600 mutations. Although the BRAFV600E mutation appears to have a critical role in tumor initiation, its expression during tumor progression remains controversial. In fact, various authors claim that BRAFV600E heterogeneity is evident in melanoma tumors. Herein, we investigated the pattern of BRAFV600E expression in matched primary and metastatic samples from 140 patients. Using a combination of real-time PCR and immunohistochemical analyses, we demonstrated that BRAFV600E expression is homogeneous in melanoma tumors and hypothesized that the heterogeneity described by others might be attributable to technical issues when molecular methods are used. We also demonstrated the high efficiency of the anti-BRAFV600E VE1 antibody for the detection of BRAFV600E mutations in melanoma tumors.",

BRAF mutation frequency ranges from 40 to 60% depending on melanoma clinical characteristics and detection technique used.Intertumoral heterogeneity could lead to misinterpretation of BRAF mutational status; this is especially important if testing is performed on primary specimens, when metastatic lesions are unavailable.Aim of this study was to identify the best combination of methods for detecting BRAF mutations (among peptide nucleic acid - PNA-clamping real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and capillary sequencing) and investigate BRAF mutation heterogeneity in a series of 100 primary melanomas and a subset of 25 matched metastatic samples.Overall, we obtained a BRAF mutation frequency of 62%, based on the combination of at least two techniques. Concordance between mutation status in primary and metastatic tumor was good but not complete (67%), when agreement of at least two techniques were considered. Next generation sequencing was used to quantify the threshold of detected mutant alleles in discordant samples. Combining different methods excludes that the observed heterogeneity is technique-based. We propose an algorithm for BRAF mutation testing based on agreement between immunohistochemistry and PNA; a third molecular method could be added in case of discordance of the results. Testing the primary tumor when the metastatic sample is unavailable is a good option if at least two methods of detection are used, however the presence of intertumoral heterogeneity or the occurrence of additional primaries should be carefully considered.",

Between 40% and 60% of melanomas demonstrate BRAF mutations, BRAF V600E being most common. Selective BRAF inhibitor therapy has shown improvement in outcome in patients with melanoma. It has been demonstrated that not all metastatic lesions carry the same BRAF mutation status as the primary, but the frequency in which discordance occurs remains unclear. Establishing this may have implications in the use of BRAF inhibitors in patients with melanoma brain metastases.Patients who underwent metastectomy for melanoma brain metastases were identified using our local histopathology database. A review of histology of the primary lesion and the metastasis was performed for each patient, assessing for BRAF mutation status discordance.Fourty-two patients who underwent a brain metastectomy following excision of a melanoma primary were identified over a 7-year period. Median survival was 9 months. The median Breslow thickness for the primary lesion was 3.4 mm. Six patients (14%) had discrepancy between the BRAF status of a melanoma primary and metastatic lesion. Of these 6 patients, 3 had a BRAF mutation positive primary with a BRAF mutation negative metastatic lesion, while the other 3 had a BRAF mutation negative primary with BRAF mutation positive metastasis.There is an important discordance rate in the BRAF mutation status of melanoma primaries versus brain metastases.",

Given this, the objective of the current study was to ascertain concordance of somatic mutations in BRAF/NRAS/TERT and immunohistochemical PD-L1 and CD8 in matched primary cutaneous and metastatic melanoma. A total of 43 archival paired samples with sufficient material for genetic and immunohistochemical analyses met the criteria for inclusion in the study. Immunohistochemistry was performed for PD-L1 and CD8 and direct-DNA Sanger sequencing for BRAF/NRAS/TERT promoter mutational analyses. Agreement between paired samples was assessed using Cohen κ. Poor concordance among primary and corresponding metastases was noted in BRAF (9/42 cases discordant, κ = 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.77; P = .0013), TERT promoter mutations (13/41 cases discordant, κ = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.04-0.62; P = .033), tumoral PD-L1 immunoexpression (9/43 cases discordant, κ = 0.39; 95% CI, 0.07-0.72; P = .0099), and immunoexpression of CD8+ T lymphocytes (12/43 cases discordant, κ = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.19-0.69; P = .002). Although NRAS1 and NRAS2 were highly concordant (42/43 and 39/43 cases, respectively), discordant NRAS2 mutational status was associated with a median time to metastasis of 90 versus 455 days for pairs with concordant status (P = .07). Although limited by sample size, our findings suggest that consideration be given to mutational analysis of metastatic tissue rather than the primary to guide BRAF-targeted therapy and question the roles of TERT promoter mutations and PD-L1 as predictive biomarkers in malignant melanoma.",

Melanoma with extreme histomorphologic heterogeneity can pose a diagnostic challenge in which the diagnosis may predominantly rely on its immunophenotypic profile. However, tumor survival and response to therapy are linked to tumor genetic heterogeneity rather than tumor morphology. Therefore, understating the molecular characteristics of such melanomas become indispensable. In this study, DNA was extracted from 11 morphologically distinct regions in eight formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded melanomas. In each region, mutations in 50 cancer-related genes were tested using next-generation sequencing (NGS). A tumor was considered genetically heterogeneous if at least one non-overlapping mutation was identified either between the histologically distinct regions of the same tumor (intratumor heterogeneity) or among the histologically distinct regions of the paired primary and metastatic tumors within the same patient (intertumor heterogeneity). Our results revealed that genetic heterogeneity existed in all tumors as non-overlapping mutations were detected in every tested tumor (n = 5, 100%; intratumor: n = 2, 40%; intertumor: n = 3, 60%). Conversely, overlapping mutations were also detected in all the tested regions (n = 11, 100%). Melanomas exhibiting histomorphologic heterogeneity are often associated with genetic heterogeneity, which might contribute to tumor survival and poor response to therapy.",
        "# Title: Intra-patient Heterogeneity of BRAF and NRAS Molecular Alterations in Primary Melanoma and Metastases.\n# Abstract: Mutations in MAPK signalling genes are driver events in melanoma, and have therapeutic relevance in the metastatic and adjuvant setting. This study evaluated the intra-patient heterogeneity of BRAF, NRAS and c-KIT mutational status between 30 primary melanomas and 39 related metastases, using molecular analysis and immunohistochemistry. BRAF mutations were identified in 46.7% of primary melanomas and 48.7% of metastases and NRAS mutations in 20% and 25.6%, respectively. Intra-patient heterogeneity was detected in 13.3% of patients for both BRAF and NRAS genes and was not associated with clinico-pathological characteristics of melanomas or metastases. High consistency was observed between immunostaining and molecular methods for BRAFV600E (k = 0.90; p < 0.001) and NRASQ61R (k = 0.87; p < 0.001). These findings demonstrate a relevant intra-patient heterogeneity between primary and metastatic lesions that is independent of clinical variables and methodological approach.",
        "# Title: Intra- and Inter-Tumor BRAF Heterogeneity in Acral Melanoma: An Immunohistochemical Analysis.\n# Abstract: The current development of BRAF inhibitors has revolutionized the treatment of unresectable melanoma. As the potential heterogeneity of BRAF mutations in melanoma has been reported, accurate detection of BRAF mutations are important. However, the genetic heterogeneity of acral melanoma-a distinct type of melanoma with a unique genetic background-has not fully been investigated. We conducted a retrospective review of our acral melanoma patients. Of the 196 patients with acral melanoma, we retrieved 31 pairs of primary and matched metastatic melanomas. We immunostained the 31 pairs with VE1, a BRAFV600E-mutation-specific monoclonal antibody. Immunohistochemistry with VE1 showed a high degree of sensitivity and specificity for detecting BRAFV600E mutations compared with the real-time polymerase chain reaction method. A total of nine primary (29.0%) and eight metastatic (25.8%) acral melanomas were positive for VE1. In three patients (9.7%), we observed a discordance of VE1 staining between the primary and metastatic lesions. Of note, VE1 immunohistochemical staining revealed a remarkable degree of intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity in acral melanoma. Our study reveals that VE1 immunostaining is a useful ancillary method for detecting BRAFV600E mutations in acral melanoma and allows for a clear visualization of intra- and inter-tumor BRAF heterogeneity.",
        "# Title: TERT, BRAF, and NRAS Mutational Heterogeneity between Paired Primary and Metastatic Melanoma Tumors.\n# Abstract: Mutational heterogeneity can contribute to therapeutic resistance in solid cancers. In melanoma, the frequencies of intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity are controversial. We examined mutational heterogeneity within individual patients with melanoma using multiplatform analysis of commonly mutated driver and nonpassenger genes. We analyzed paired primary and metastatic tumors from 60 patients and multiple metastatic tumors from 39 patients whose primary tumors were unavailable (n = 271 tumors). We used a combination of multiplex SNaPshot assays, Sanger sequencing, mutation-specific PCR, or droplet digital PCR to determine the presence of BRAFV600, NRASQ61, TERT-124C>T, and TERT-146C>T mutations. Mutations were detected in BRAF (39%), NRAS (21%), and/or TERT (78%). Thirteen patients had TERTmutant discordant tumors; seven of these had a single tumor with both TERT-124C>T and TERT-146C>T mutations present at different allele frequencies. Two patients had both BRAF and NRAS mutations; one had different tumors and the other had a single tumor with both mutations. One patient with a BRAFmutant primary lacked mutant BRAF in at least one of their metastases. Overall, we identified mutational heterogeneity in 18 of 99 patients (18%). These results suggest that some primary melanomas may be composed of subclones with differing mutational profiles. Such heterogeneity may be relevant to treatment responses and survival outcomes."

While generally observed as homogeneous, evidence of intra-tumor heterogeneity within individual primary or metastatic lesions has also been documented, suggesting the presence of subclones with differing BRAF genotypes.",

This genetic discordance, particularly concerning alterations like *CDKN2A* and *TP53*, is associated with clinically significant implications, including treatment resistance and potentially poorer outcomes, underscoring the necessity of considering the genetic profile of metastatic disease for optimal patient management."

        "# Title: Prospective and randomized evaluation of ACL reconstruction with three techniques: a clinical and radiographic evaluation at 5 years follow-up.\n# Abstract: A variety of graft sources have been used for ACL reconstruction to improve functions and kinematics in ACL deficient knees. The two most commonly used autogenous grafts are the central third of the patellar tendon and the hamstring tendon constructs. The choice of different grafts and different construct influence the final clinical outcome of ACL reconstruction. The 3 groups, of 25 patients each, were generated by choosing the technique (PT tendon, 4 strand hamstring, and single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty) to utilize and followed for 5 years, with an alternate systematic sampling. Our comparison has shown significant kneeling pain in the patellar tendon with respect to the groups with hamstrings techniques. Single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty achieved subjective score significantly higher with respect to the other two groups as well as for the time to resume sport. The study confirms that patellar tendon and hamstring can be equivalent options for ACL reconstruction. This study demonstrated that a superior outcome as far as subjective clinical findings were concerned, was obtained in group III. Patients in the latter group were also able to return to sports sooner than those in the bone-patellar tendon graft group and the four-strand hamstring group.",

The purpose of this prospective randomized study was to compare the clinical, instrumental and X-ray outcome of two ACL reconstruction techniques with hamstring tendons: one with a single intra-articular bundle associated to an extra-articular sling, the second with a more anatomic double-bundle technique that reproduces better the native ACL function. From an initial group of 100 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction, 72 patients (35 single bundle plus lateral plasty and 37 double bundle) were evaluated with IKDC, Tegner score, KT2000 arthrometer, Activity Rating Scale, Psychovitality Questionnaire and Ahlback radiographic score at a mean 3 years follow-up. Double-bundle group showed significantly better results regarding IKDC, ROM, Activity Rating Scale and time to return to sport. Also KT 2000 showed significant differences in objective stability.

We prospectively evaluated a series of 100 consecutive patients who underwent ACL reconstruction between 2001 and 2002. A clinical and radiological follow-up was performed at a minimum of 6 years. After 6 years, the International Knee Documentation Committee score demonstrated good-to-excellent results (A and B) in 98% of patients. However, arthrometric results using the KT-1000 demonstrated that 6/80 patients (7.5%) had >5 mm manual maximum side-to-side difference. The median Tegner activity score was 5 (range 1-9); the median Lysholm score was 96 (range 81-100); and the median subjective IKDC score was 94 (range 66-100).

Four hundred twenty-nine patients had migraine, of which 16.5% reported that headaches could be precipitated by cheese or chocolate, and nearly always both. Of the migraine patients, 18.4% reported sensitivity to all alcoholic drinks, while another 11.8% were sensitive to red wine but not to white wine; 28% of the migrainous patients reported that beer would precipitate headaches. There was a definite statistical association between sensitivity to cheese/chocolate and to red wine (P < 0.001) and also to beer (P < 0.001), but none between diet sensitivity and sensitivity to alcoholic drinks in general. None of 40 patients with tension headache (diagnosed by International Headache Society criteria) reported sensitivity to foods, and only one was sensitive to alcoholic drinks. The prevalence of sensitivity among 46 patients with some migrainous features was intermediate between the migraine and tension headache categories. It is concluded that cheese/chocolate and red wine sensitivity, in particular, have closely related mechanisms, in some way related more to migraine than to more chronic tension-type headache, while quite separate mechanisms play a major role in sensitivity to alcoholic drinks in general.",

Questionnaire-based information on smoking was available in 95% and on alcohol in 89% of the individuals. Associations were assessed in multivariate analyses, estimating prevalence odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Prevalence rates for headache were higher amongst smokers compared with never smokers, most evident for those under 40 years smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.6). Passive smoking was also associated with higher headache prevalence. For alcohol use, there was a tendency of decreasing prevalence of migraine with increasing amounts of alcohol consumption compared with alcohol abstinence. Only with regard to symptoms indicating alcohol overuse, a positive association with frequent headache was found. The association between headache and smoking found in the present study raises questions about a causal relationship, e.g. that smoking causes headache or that it allays stress induced by headache.

Sequence-influenced methylations were described in T2DM-associated genomic regions, but evidence for direct, sequence-independent association with disease risk is missing. Here, we explore disease-contributing DNA methylation through a stepwise study design: first, a pool-based, genome-scale screen among 1169 case and control individuals revealed an excess of differentially methylated sites in genomic regions that were previously associated with T2DM through genetic studies. Next, in-depth analyses were performed at selected top-ranking regions. A CpG site in the first intron of the FTO gene showed small (3.35%) but significant (P = 0.000021) hypomethylation of cases relative to controls. The effect was independent of the sequence polymorphism in the region and persists among individuals carrying the sequence-risk alleles. The odds of belonging to the T2DM group increased by 6.1% for every 1% decrease in methylation (OR = 1.061, 95% CI: 1.032-1.090), the odds ratio for decrease of 1 standard deviation of methylation (adjusted to gender) was 1.5856 (95% CI: 1.2824-1.9606) and the sensitivity (area under the curve = 0.638, 95% CI: 0.586-0.690; males = 0.675, females = 0.609) was better than that of the strongest known sequence variant. Furthermore, a prospective study in an independent population cohort revealed significant hypomethylation of young individuals that later progressed to T2DM, relative to the individuals who stayed healthy. Further genomic analysis revealed co-localization with gene enhancers and with binding sites for methylation-sensitive transcriptional regulators. The data showed that low methylation level at the analyzed sites is an early marker of T2DM and suggests a novel mechanism by which early-onset, inter-individual methylation variation at isolated non-promoter genomic sites predisposes to T2DM.",
        "# Title: DNA methylation profiling identifies epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetic patients.\n# Abstract: In addition to genetic predisposition, environmental and lifestyle factors contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Epigenetic changes may provide the link for translating environmental exposures into pathological mechanisms. In this study, we performed the first comprehensive DNA methylation profiling in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We uncovered 276 CpG loci affiliated to promoters of 254 genes displaying significant differential DNA methylation in diabetic islets. These methylation changes were not present in blood cells from T2D individuals nor were they experimentally induced in non-diabetic islets by exposure to high glucose. For a subgroup of the differentially methylated genes, concordant transcriptional changes were present. Functional annotation of the aberrantly methylated genes and RNAi experiments highlighted pathways implicated in β-cell survival and function; some are implicated in cellular dysfunction while others facilitate adaptation to stressors. Together, our findings offer new insights into the intricate mechanisms of T2D pathogenesis, underscore the important involvement of epigenetic dysregulation in diabetic islets and may advance our understanding of T2D aetiology.",

        "# Title: Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of human pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic donors identifies candidate genes that influence insulin secretion.\n# Abstract: Impaired insulin secretion is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Epigenetics may affect disease susceptibility. To describe the human methylome in pancreatic islets and determine the epigenetic basis of T2D, we analyzed DNA methylation of 479,927 CpG sites and the transcriptome in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We provide a detailed map of the global DNA methylation pattern in human islets, β- and α-cells. Genomic regions close to the transcription start site showed low degrees of methylation and regions further away from the transcription start site such as the gene body, 3'UTR and intergenic regions showed a higher degree of methylation. While CpG islands were hypomethylated, the surrounding 2 kb shores showed an intermediate degree of methylation, whereas regions further away (shelves and open sea) were hypermethylated in human islets, β- and α-cells. We identified 1,649 CpG sites and 853 genes, including TCF7L2, FTO and KCNQ1, with differential DNA methylation in T2D islets after correction for multiple testing. The majority of the differentially methylated CpG sites had an intermediate degree of methylation and were underrepresented in CpG islands (∼ 7%) and overrepresented in the open sea (∼ 60%). 102 of the differentially methylated genes, including CDKN1A, PDE7B, SEPT9 and EXOC3L2, were differentially expressed in T2D islets. Methylation of CDKN1A and PDE7B promoters in vitro suppressed their transcriptional activity. Functional analyses demonstrated that identified candidate genes affect pancreatic β- and α-cells as Exoc3l silencing reduced exocytosis and overexpression of Cdkn1a, Pde7b and Sept9 perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion in clonal β- and α-cells, respectively. Together, our data can serve as a reference methylome in human islets. We provide new target genes with altered DNA methylation and expression in human T2D islets that contribute to perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion. These results highlight the importance of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of T2D.",
        "# Title: Altered DNA methylation and differential expression of genes influencing metabolism and inflammation in adipose tissue from subjects with type 2 diabetes.\n# Abstract: Genetics, epigenetics, and environment may together affect the susceptibility for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our aim was to dissect molecular mechanisms underlying T2D using genome-wide expression and DNA methylation data in adipose tissue from monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D and independent case-control cohorts. In adipose tissue from diabetic twins, we found decreased expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation; carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism; and increased expression of genes involved in inflammation and glycan degradation. The most differentially expressed genes included ELOVL6, GYS2, FADS1, SPP1 (OPN), CCL18, and IL1RN. We replicated these results in adipose tissue from an independent case-control cohort. Several candidate genes for obesity and T2D (e.g., IRS1 and VEGFA) were differentially expressed in discordant twins. We found a heritable contribution to the genome-wide DNA methylation variability in twins. Differences in methylation between monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D were subsequently modest. However, 15,627 sites, representing 7,046 genes including PPARG, KCNQ1, TCF7L2, and IRS1, showed differential DNA methylation in adipose tissue from unrelated subjects with T2D compared with control subjects. A total of 1,410 of these sites also showed differential DNA methylation in the twins discordant for T2D. For the differentially methylated sites, the heritability estimate was 0.28. We also identified copy number variants (CNVs) in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D. Taken together, subjects with T2D exhibit multiple transcriptional and epigenetic changes in adipose tissue relevant to the development of the disease.",
        "# Title: An integrated epigenomic analysis for type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci in monozygotic twins.\n# Abstract: DNA methylation has a great potential for understanding the aetiology of common complex traits such as Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here we perform genome-wide methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) in whole-blood-derived DNA from 27 monozygotic twin pairs and follow up results with replication and integrated omics analyses. We identify predominately hypermethylated T2D-related differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and replicate the top signals in 42 unrelated T2D cases and 221 controls. The strongest signal is in the promoter of the MALT1 gene, involved in insulin and glycaemic pathways, and related to taurocholate levels in blood. Integrating the DNA methylome findings with T2D GWAS meta-analysis results reveals a strong enrichment for DMRs in T2D-susceptibility loci. We also detect signals specific to T2D-discordant twins in the GPR61 and PRKCB genes. These replicated T2D associations reflect both likely causal and consequential pathways of the disease. The analysis indicates how an integrated genomics and epigenomics approach, utilizing an MZ twin design, can provide pathogenic insights as well as potential drug targets and biomarkers for T2D and other complex traits.",

In the setting of large, extended families representing a minority, high-risk population of the USA, we aimed to characterize the role of epigenome-wide DNA methylation in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Using Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays, we tested for association of DNA methylation at 446 356 sites with age, sex and phenotypic traits related to T2D in 850 pedigreed Mexican-American individuals. Robust statistical analyses showed that (i) 15% of the methylome is significantly heritable, with a median heritability of 0.14; (ii) DNA methylation at 14% of CpG sites is associated with nearby sequence variants; (iii) 22% and 3% of the autosomal CpG sites are associated with age and sex, respectively; (iv) 53 CpG sites were significantly associated with liability to T2D, fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance; (v) DNA methylation levels at five CpG sites, mapping to three well-characterized genes (TXNIP, ABCG1 and SAMD12) independently explained 7.8% of the heritability of T2D (vi) methylation at these five sites was unlikely to be influenced by neighboring DNA sequence variation. Our study has identified novel epigenetic indicators of T2D risk in Mexican Americans who have increased risk for this disease. These results provide new insights into potential treatment targets of T2D.",

        "# Title: Epigenome-wide association study identifies TXNIP gene associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and sustained hyperglycemia.\n# Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is an established risk factor for a wide range of vascular diseases, including ischemic stroke (IS). Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a marker for average blood glucose levels over the previous 12 weeks, is used as a measure of glycemic control and also as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes (HbA1c levels ≥ 6.5%). Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, may be associated with aging processes and with modulation of the risk of various pathologies, such as DM. Specifically, DNA methylation could be one of the mechanisms mediating the relation between DM and environmental exposures. Our goal was to identify new CpG methylation sites associated with DM. We performed a genome-wide methylation study in whole-blood DNA from an IS patient cohorts. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array was used to measure DNA methylation in CpG sites. All statistical analyses were adjusted for sex, age, hyperlipidemia, body mass index (BMI), smoking habit and cell count. Findings were replicated in two independent cohorts, an IS cohort and a population-based cohort, using the same array. In the discovery phase (N = 355), we identified a CpG site, cg19693031 (located in the TXNIP gene) that was associated with DM (P = 1.17 × 10(-12)); this CpG was replicated in two independent cohorts (N = 167 and N = 645). Methylation of TXNIP was inversely and intensely associated with HbA1c levels (P = 7.3 × 10(-16)), specifically related to diabetic patients with poor control of glucose levels. We identified an association between the TXNIP gene and DM through epigenetic mechanisms, related to sustained hyperglycemia levels (HbA1c ≥ 7%).",

Here we examine whether age-related epigenetic changes affect human islet function and if blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect these changes and associate with future T2D. We analyse DNA methylation genome-wide in islets from 87 non-diabetic donors, aged 26-74 years. Aging associates with increased DNA methylation of 241 sites. These sites cover loci previously associated with T2D, for example, KLF14. Blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related methylation changes in 83 genes identified in human islets (for example, KLF14, FHL2, ZNF518B and FAM123C) and some associate with insulin secretion and T2D. DNA methylation correlates with islet expression of multiple genes, including FHL2, ZNF518B, GNPNAT1 and HLTF. Silencing these genes in β-cells alter insulin secretion. Together, we demonstrate that blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related DNA methylation changes in human islets, and associate with insulin secretion in vivo and T2D.",

To conduct a genome-wide DNA methylation in individuals with type 2 diabetes, individuals with prediabetes, and control mixed ancestry individuals from South Africa. Methods. We used peripheral blood to perform genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in 3 individuals with screen detected diabetes, 3 individuals with prediabetes, and 3 individuals with normoglycaemia from the Bellville South Community, Cape Town, South Africa, who were age-, gender-, body mass index-, and duration of residency-matched. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) was performed by Arraystar Inc. (Rockville, MD, USA). Results. Hypermethylated DMRs were 1160 (81.97%) and 124 (43.20%), respectively, in individuals with diabetes and prediabetes when both were compared to subjects with normoglycaemia. Our data shows that genes related to the immune system, signal transduction, glucose transport, and pancreas development have altered DNA methylation in subjects with prediabetes and diabetes. Pathway analysis based on the functional analysis mapping of genes to KEGG pathways suggested that the linoleic acid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism pathways are hypomethylated in prediabetes and diabetes. Conclusions. Our study suggests that epigenetic changes are likely to be an early process that occurs before the onset of overt diabetes. Detailed analysis of DMRs that shows gradual methylation differences from control versus prediabetes to prediabetes versus diabetes in a larger sample size is required to confirm these findings.",
        "# Title: Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing of Human Pancreatic Islets Reveals Novel Differentially Methylated Regions in Type 2 Diabetes Pathogenesis.\n# Abstract: Current knowledge about the role of epigenetics in type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains limited. Only a few studies have investigated DNA methylation of selected candidate genes or a very small fraction of genomic CpG sites in human pancreatic islets, the tissue of primary pathogenic importance for diabetes. Our aim was to characterize the whole-genome DNA methylation landscape in human pancreatic islets, to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in diabetic islets, and to investigate the function of DMRs in islet biology. Here, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, which is a comprehensive and unbiased method to study DNA methylation throughout the genome at a single nucleotide resolution, in pancreatic islets from donors with T2D and control subjects without diabetes. We identified 25,820 DMRs in islets from individuals with T2D. These DMRs cover loci with known islet function, e.g., PDX1, TCF7L2, and ADCY5 Importantly, binding sites previously identified by ChIP-seq for islet-specific transcription factors, enhancer regions, and different histone marks were enriched in the T2D-associated DMRs. We also identified 457 genes, including NR4A3, PARK2, PID1, SLC2A2, and SOCS2, that had both DMRs and significant expression changes in T2D islets. To mimic the situation in T2D islets, candidate genes were overexpressed or silenced in cultured β-cells. This resulted in impaired insulin secretion, thereby connecting differential methylation to islet dysfunction. We further explored the islet methylome and found a strong link between methylation levels and histone marks. Additionally, DNA methylation in different genomic regions and of different transcript types (i.e., protein coding, noncoding, and pseudogenes) was associated with islet expression levels. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the islet DNA methylome in individuals with and without diabetes and highlights the importance of epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets and T2D pathogenesis."

We sought to evaluate the predictive role of frailty in an observational cohort study of inpatients with decompensated cirrhosis between 2010 and 2013. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included discharge to a rehabilitation hospital, 30-day readmission, and length of stay. Frailty was assessed with three metrics: activities of daily living (ADL), the Braden Scale, and the Morse fall risk score. A predictive model was validated by randomly dividing the population into training and validation cohorts: 734 patients were admitted 1358 times in the study period. The overall 90-day mortality was 18.3%. The 30-day readmission rate was 26.6%, and the rate of discharge to a rehabilitation facility was 14.3%. Adjusting for sex, age, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, sodium, and Charlson index, the odds ratio for the effect of an ADL score of less than 12 of 15 on mortality is 1.83 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-3.20). A predictive model for 90-day mortality including ADL and Braden Scale yielded C statistics of 0.83 (95% CI 0.80-0.86) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.71-0.83) in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively.

        "# Title: Frailty, Psychoactive Medications, and Cognitive Dysfunction Are Associated With Poor Patient-Reported Outcomes in Cirrhosis.\n# Abstract: Cirrhosis is associated with disabling symptoms and diminished health-related quality of life (HRQOL). However, for patients with compensated disease, data are limited regarding associations with poor patient-reported outcomes (PROs). We prospectively enrolled 300 patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension without a history of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and reviewed medical and pharmacy records. We characterized determinants of PROs using the 8-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-8) scale (0-100) and sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; poor sleep >5). Disability and frailty measures were assessed using activities of daily living (ADLs), falls, hand-grip, and chair-stands. Cognitive function was measured using weighted-lures from the Inhibitory Control Test (ICT). The median age of our cohort was 60 (interquartile range [IQR], 52-66) years, 56.3% were male, and 70% Child class A. All patients had portal hypertension, 76% had varices, and 41% had a history of ascites (predominantly well controlled). The median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease with Sodium (MELD-Na) score was 9 (IQR, 7-13). The overall median SF-8 was 70 (IQR, 54-86). Multivariate analysis showed that after adjusting for age, sex, education, and MELD-Na, performance on chair-stands (9.28 HRQOL points [95% confidence interval {CI}, 4.76-13.8] per 10-stands), ADL dependence (-6.06 [-10.8 to -1.36]), opiate use (-5.01 [-7.84 to -2.19]), benzodiazepine use (-3.50 [-6.58 to -0.42]), and ICT performance (-0.10 [-0.20 to 0.001] per weighted-lure) were significantly associated with HRQOL. Among patients completing the ICT, poor HRQOL (score <50) was significantly associated with chair-stands (odds ratio [OR] per 10-stands, 0.24; 95% CI [0.11-0.56]) and weighted lures (OR per weighted-lure, 1.01 [1.00-1.03]). Poor sleep quality was associated with opiate use (OR, 2.85 [1.11-7.29]) and lures (OR per-lure, 1.03 [1.00-1.05]). Conclusion: Disability, chair-stand performance, cognitive dysfunction, as well as psychoactive medication use are significantly associated with PROs in patients with clinically stable cirrhosis.",

        "# Title: Frailty Is a Risk Factor for Postoperative Mortality in Patients With Cirrhosis Undergoing Diverse Major Surgeries.\n# Abstract: With a rising burden of cirrhosis surgeries, understanding risk factors for postoperative mortality is more salient than ever. The role of baseline frailty has not been assessed in this context. We evaluated the association between patient frailty and postoperative risk among diverse patients with cirrhosis and determined if frailty improves prognostication of cirrhosis surgical risk scores. This was a retrospective cohort study of U.S. veterans with cirrhosis identified between 2008 and 2016 who underwent nontransplant major surgery. Frailty was ascertained using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS). Cox regression analysis was used to investigate the impact of patient frailty on postoperative mortality. Logistic regression was used to identify incremental changes in discrimination for postoperative mortality when frailty was added to the risk prediction models, including the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), MELD-sodium (MELD-Na), Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP), Mayo Risk Score (MRS), and Veterans Outcomes and Costs Associated With Liver Disease (VOCAL)-Penn. A total of 804 cirrhosis surgeries were identified. The majority of patients (48.5%) had high-risk frailty at baseline (HFRS >15). In adjusted Cox regression models, categories of increasing frailty scores were associated with poorer postoperative survival. For example, intermediate-risk frailty (HFRS 5-15) conferred a 1.77-fold increased hazard relative to low-risk frailty (HFRS, <5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-2.95; P = 0.03). High-risk frailty demonstrated a similarly increased hazard (hazard ratio, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.05-2.88; P = 0.03), suggesting a threshold effect of frailty on postoperative mortality. The incorporation of frailty improved discrimination of MELD, MELD-Na, and CTP for postoperative mortality, but did not do so for the MRS or VOCAL-Penn score. Patient frailty was an additional important predictor of cirrhosis surgical risk. The incorporation of preoperative frailty assessments may help to risk stratify patients, especially in settings where the MELD-Na and CTP are commonly applied.",

        "# Title: Inpatient Frailty Assessment Is Feasible and Predicts Nonhome Discharge and Mortality in Decompensated Cirrhosis.\n# Abstract: Objective inpatient frailty assessments in decompensated cirrhosis are understudied. We examined the feasibility of inpatient frailty measurements and associations with nonhome discharge, readmission, and all-cause mortality among patients admitted for cirrhosis complications. We conducted a prospective study at 3 liver transplantation (LT) centers. Frailty was assessed using the liver frailty index (LFI). Multivariable logistic and competing risk models evaluated associations between frailty and clinical outcomes. We included 211 patients with median MELD-Na score 21 (interquartile range [IQR],15-27); 96 (45%) were women, and 102 (48%) were on the LT waiting list. At a median follow-up of 8.3 months, 29 patients (14%) were nonhome discharged, 144 (68%) were readmitted, 70 (33%) underwent LT, and 44 (21%) died. A total of 124 patients (59%) were frail, with a median LFI of 4.71 (IQR, 4.07-5.54). Frail patients were older (mean, 59 versus 54 years) and more likely to have chronic kidney disease (40% versus 20%; P = 0.002) and coronary artery disease (17% versus 7%; P = 0.03). Frailty was associated with hospital-acquired infections (8% versus 1%; P = 0.02). In multivariable models, LFI was associated with nonhome discharge (odds ratio, 1.81 per 1-point increase; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-2.86). Frailty (LFI≥4.5) was associated with all-cause mortality in models accounting for LT as competing risk (subhazard ratio [sHR], 2.4; 95% CI, 1.13-5.11); results were similar with LFI as a continuous variable (sHR, 1.62 per 1-point increase; 95% CI, 1.15-2.28). A brief, objective inpatient frailty assessment was feasible and predicted nonhome discharge and mortality in decompensated cirrhosis. Inpatient point-of-care frailty assessment prior to hospital discharge can be useful for risk stratification and targeted interventions to improve physical fitness and reduce adverse outcomes.",

        "# Title: Health-Related Quality of Life and Its Contributors According to a Preference-Based Generic Instrument in Cirrhosis.\n# Abstract: It is essential to determine contributors around impairment in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with cirrhosis aiming at improving health care and therapeutic strategy. Studies simultaneously incorporating disease severity based on biochemical parameters and other physical/psychological effects (i.e., sleep disturbance and frailty) are heterogeneous and the subject of the present study. We analyzed and compared HRQoL, using the EuroQol Group 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire and the utility index retrieved, in patients with cirrhosis and across groups stratified by sleep disturbance or frailty phenotype. Sleep disturbance and frailty were determined by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Frailty Index, respectively. Multiple linear regression was implemented to clarify contributors of poor HRQoL. In this cohort of 227 patients with mean age of 61.7 years and 47.2% male, more than half of the study population represented impairment in HRQoL in at least one domain, according to EQ-5D. Furthermore, sleep disturbance and frailty have proved to be independently associated with poor HRQoL in two separate regression models, whereas conventional scoring systems such as Child-Pugh classification and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease are not closely relevant. Intriguingly, not all health domains within EQ-5D correlated well with PSQI and Frailty Index, with the exception of usual activities. Pain and anxiety/depression were the most frequently affected HRQoL domains even in patients without sleep disturbance or frailty. Conclusion: Impaired HRQoL is prevalent in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Sleep disturbance and frailty are independently associated with poor HRQoL. It is imperative to timely intervene with these symptoms and deliver tailored health care.",

        "# Title: Liver Frailty Index for Prediction of Short-Term Rehospitalization in Patients with Liver Cirrhosis.\n# Abstract: Background: Stratifying patients with liver cirrhosis for risk of rehospitalization is challenging with established scoring systems for chronic liver disease. Frailty captures the physical characteristics of patients with cirrhosis. Its value for predicting short-term rehospitalizations in hospitalized patients remains to be defined. Methods: Eighty-three non-electively hospitalized patients with liver cirrhosis were analyzed in this study. Frailty was assessed during the last 48 h of hospital stay with the liver frailty index (LFI). Patients were followed for 30-day rehospitalization. Results: In total, 26 (31%) patients were rehospitalized within 30 days. The median LFI was 4.5, and 43 (52%) patients were identified as frail. Rehospitalized patients had a significant higher LFI compared to patients without a rehospitalization within 30 days. In multivariable analysis, LFI as a metric variable (OR 2.36, p = 0.02) and lower platelet count (OR 0.98, p < 0.01) were independently associated with rehospitalization. LFI and its subtest chair stands had the best discriminative ability to predict rehospitalization, with AUROCs of 0.66 and 0.67, respectively. An LFI cut-off of >4.62 discriminated best between patients with and without elevated risk for rehospitalization within 30 days. Conclusions: Measures of frailty could be useful to identify patients at higher risk for short-term rehospitalization.",

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a cross-sectional study involving individuals aged 32 to 69 years, all diagnosed with liver cirrhosis. The chronic liver disease questionnaire (CLDQ) was used to assess HR-QoL, the CLDQ score was used as an outcome to measure the factors related to HR-QoL, and the liver frailty index (LFI) was used to assess the frailty status. The association between the frailty status and the CLDQ summary scales was investigated using the correlation coefficient and multiple regression analyses. A total of 138 patients in the frail (n = 62) and non-frail (n = 76) groups with (alcohol: 97; viral: 24; autoimmune: 17; and cryptogenic: 12) were included in the study.

This single-center study was conducted to assess the accuracy of SWE in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), in comparison with transient elastography (TE), by using liver biopsy (LB) as the reference standard. Consecutive patients with CHC scheduled for LB by referring physicians were studied. One hundred and twenty-one patients met inclusion criteria. On the same day, real-time SWE using the ultrasound (US) system, Aixplorer (SuperSonic Imagine S.A., Aix-en-Provence, France), TE using FibroScan (Echosens, Paris, France), and US-assisted LB were consecutively performed. Fibrosis was staged according to the METAVIR scoring system.

The rate of reliable liver stiffness measurements was significantly higher with 2-D SWE than with TE: 99.2% versus 74.8%, p < 0.0001 (different reliability criteria used, according to current recommendations). In univariate analysis, liver stiffness measured with 2-D SWE correlated best with fibrosis stage estimated with TE (r = 0.699, p < 0.0001), followed by Forns score (r = 0.534, p < 0.0001) and King's score (r = 0.512, p < 0.0001). However, in multivariate analysis, only 2-D SWE-measured values remained correlated with fibrosis stage (p < 0.0001).

The study included 132 patients with chronic hepatopathies, in which liver stiffness was evaluated using transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging and 2-D SWE. The reference methods were liver biopsy for the assessment of liver fibrosis (n = 101) and magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography for the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis (n = 31). No significant difference in diagnostic accuracy, assessed as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), was found between the three elastography methods (2-D SWE, transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging) for the diagnosis of significant and advanced fibrosis and liver cirrhosis in the \"per protocol\" (AUROCs for fibrosis stages ≥2: 0.90, 0.95 and 0.91; for fibrosis stage [F] ≥3: 0.93, 0.95 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.92, 0.96 and 0.92) and \"intention to diagnose\" cohort (AUROCs for F ≥2: 0.87, 0.92 and 0.91; for F ≥3: 0.91, 0.93 and 0.94; for F = 4: 0.88, 0.90 and 0.89). Therefore, 2-D SWE, ARFI imaging and transient elastography seem to be comparably good methods for non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis.",

The goal of this study was to assess the clinical use of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) evaluated by supersonic shear imaging (SSI), FibroScan, and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) in a cohort of NAFLD patients who underwent liver biopsy. A total of 291 NAFLD patients were prospectively enrolled from November 2011 to February 2015 at 2 French university hospitals. LSM was assessed by SSI, FibroScan (M probe), and ARFI within two weeks prior to liver biopsy. Calculations of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) were performed and compared for the staging of liver fibrosis. AUROC for SSI, FibroScan, and ARFI were 0.86, 0.82, and 0.77 for diagnoses of ≥F2; 0.89, 0.86, and 0.84 for ≥F3; and 0.88, 0.87, and 0.84 for F4, respectively. SSI had a higher accuracy than ARFI for diagnoses of significant fibrosis (≥F2) (P = 0.004). Clinical factors related to obesity such as body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2) , waist circumference ≥102 cm or increased parietal wall thickness were associated with LSM failures when using SSI or FibroScan and with unreliable results when using ARFI. In univariate analysis, FibroScan values were slightly correlated with NAFLD activity score and steatosis (R = 0.28 and 0.22, respectively), whereas SSI and ARFI were not; however, these components of NAFLD did not affect LSM results in multivariate analysis. The cutoff values for SSI and FibroScan for staging fibrosis with a sensitivity ≥90% were very close: 6.3/6.2 kPa for ≥F2, 8.3/8.2 kPa for ≥F3, and 10.5/9.5 kPa for F4.",

Patients with CHB infection who underwent liver biopsy were consecutively included. After exclusions, 257 patients were analyzed. Two-dimensional SWE resulted in a significantly higher rate of reliable measurements (98.1%, 252/257) than TE (93.0%, 239/257) (p = 0.011).

The purpose of this study was to perform an intra-individual comparison between 2-D shear wave elastography (2-D-SWE with a GE system) and Virtual Touch Tissue Quantification (VTTQ with a Siemens system) to assess whether these can be used interchangeably to grade fibrosis. Ninety-three patients (51 men, 42 women; mean age, 54 y) with liver disease of various etiologies (hepatitis B virus = 47, hepatitis C virus = 22; alcohol = 6, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis = 5, other = 13) were included. Using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values, liver fibrosis was classified into clinically non-significant (F0/F1) and significant (≥F2) fibrosis. Results indicated that intra-modality repeatability was excellent for both techniques (GE 2-D-SWE: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.89 [0.84-0.93]; VTTQ: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.90 [0.86-0.93]). Intra-modality classification agreement for fibrosis grading was good to excellent (GE 2-D-SWE: κ = 0.65, VTTQ: κ = 0.82). However, inter-modality agreement for fibrosis grading was only fair (κ = 0.31) using published system-specific shear wave speed cutoff values of fibrosis. In conclusion, although both GE 2-D-SWE and Siemens VTTQ exhibit good to excellent intra-modality repeatability, inter-modality agreement is only fair, suggesting that these should not be used interchangeably.",

Four hundred twenty-nine patients had migraine, of which 16.5% reported that headaches could be precipitated by cheese or chocolate, and nearly always both. Of the migraine patients, 18.4% reported sensitivity to all alcoholic drinks, while another 11.8% were sensitive to red wine but not to white wine; 28% of the migrainous patients reported that beer would precipitate headaches. There was a definite statistical association between sensitivity to cheese/chocolate and to red wine (P < 0.001) and also to beer (P < 0.001), but none between diet sensitivity and sensitivity to alcoholic drinks in general. None of 40 patients with tension headache (diagnosed by International Headache Society criteria) reported sensitivity to foods, and only one was sensitive to alcoholic drinks. The prevalence of sensitivity among 46 patients with some migrainous features was intermediate between the migraine and tension headache categories. It is concluded that cheese/chocolate and red wine sensitivity, in particular, have closely related mechanisms, in some way related more to migraine than to more chronic tension-type headache, while quite separate mechanisms play a major role in sensitivity to alcoholic drinks in general.",

A total of 51,383 subjects completed a headache questionnaire and constituted the 'Head-HUNT' Study. Questionnaire-based information on smoking was available in 95% and on alcohol in 89% of the individuals. Associations were assessed in multivariate analyses, estimating prevalence odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Prevalence rates for headache were higher amongst smokers compared with never smokers, most evident for those under 40 years smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.6). Passive smoking was also associated with higher headache prevalence. For alcohol use, there was a tendency of decreasing prevalence of migraine with increasing amounts of alcohol consumption compared with alcohol abstinence. Only with regard to symptoms indicating alcohol overuse, a positive association with frequent headache was found. The association between headache and smoking found in the present study raises questions about a causal relationship, e.g. that smoking causes headache or that it allays stress induced by headache. The observed negative association between migraine and alcohol consumption is probably explained by the headache precipitating properties of alcohol.",

Here, we present data from a retrospective analysis using PET/CT and PET/MRI examinations to investigate the efficacy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET for primary N-staging of patients with prostate cancer (PC) compared with morphologic imaging (CT or MRI) and validated by histopathology. Methods: Data from 58 patients with high-risk PC (according to the D'Amico criteria) who were staged with 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET/CT or PET/MRI at our institution between July 2017 and June 2018 were reviewed. The patients had a median prescan prostate-specific antigen value of 12.2 ng/mL (range, 1.2-81.6 ng/mL). The median injected activity of 18F-rhPSMA-7 was 327 MBq (range, 132-410 MBq), with a median uptake time of 79.5 min (range, 60-153 min). All patients underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection. The presence of lymph node metastases was determined by an experienced reader independently for both the PET and the morphologic datasets using a template-based analysis on a 5-point scale. Patient-level and template-based results were both compared with histopathologic findings. Results: Lymph node metastases were present in 18 patients (31.0%) and were located in 52 of 375 templates (13.9%). Receiver-operating-characteristic analyses showed 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET to perform significantly better than morphologic imaging on both patient-based and template-based analyses (areas under curve, 0.858 vs. 0.649 [P = 0.012] and 0.765 vs. 0.589 [P < 0.001], respectively). On patient-based analyses, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET were 72.2%, 92.5%, and 86.2%, respectively, and those of morphologic imaging were 50.0%, 72.5%, and 65.5%, respectively. On template-based analyses, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET were 53.8%, 96.9%, and 90.9%, respectively, and those of morphologic imaging were 9.6%, 95.0%, and 83.2%, respectively.

On the basis of clinical results, 18F-PSMA-1007 is a promising PSMA PET tracer, but detailed histologic confirmation has been lacking. Methods: Ninety-six patients with prostate cancer underwent 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT followed by either radical prostatectomy with lymphadenectomy or salvage lymphadenectomy. The histologic findings of PSMA PET-positive nodes were analyzed retrospectively. A lesion-based and patient-based analysis was performed comparing all positive lesions and only lesions larger than 3 mm on histopathology. Results: Of the patients, 90.6% received 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT for staging before the primary treatment, whereas 9.4% underwent imaging for biochemical recurrence. In 34.4% of the cohort, positive lymph nodes were present on imaging.

The two most commonly used autogenous grafts are the central third of the patellar tendon and the hamstring tendon constructs. The choice of different grafts and different construct influence the final clinical outcome of ACL reconstruction. The 3 groups, of 25 patients each, were generated by choosing the technique (PT tendon, 4 strand hamstring, and single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty) to utilize and followed for 5 years, with an alternate systematic sampling. Our comparison has shown significant kneeling pain in the patellar tendon with respect to the groups with hamstrings techniques. Single hamstring plus extraarticular plasty achieved subjective score significantly higher with respect to the other two groups as well as for the time to resume sport. The study confirms that patellar tendon and hamstring can be equivalent options for ACL reconstruction.

From an initial group of 100 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction, 72 patients (35 single bundle plus lateral plasty and 37 double bundle) were evaluated with IKDC, Tegner score, KT2000 arthrometer, Activity Rating Scale, Psychovitality Questionnaire and Ahlback radiographic score at a mean 3 years follow-up. Double-bundle group showed significantly better results regarding IKDC, ROM, Activity Rating Scale and time to return to sport. Also KT 2000 showed significant differences in objective stability. The double-bundle technique for ACL reconstruction described in this paper has demonstrated significantly better subjective, objective and functional results compared with a double-stranded hamstrings plus extra-articular sling at a minimum 3-year follow-up.",

We prospectively evaluated a series of 100 consecutive patients who underwent ACL reconstruction between 2001 and 2002. A clinical and radiological follow-up was performed at a minimum of 6 years. After 6 years, the International Knee Documentation Committee score demonstrated good-to-excellent results (A and B) in 98% of patients. However, arthrometric results using the KT-1000 demonstrated that 6/80 patients (7.5%) had >5 mm manual maximum side-to-side difference. The median Tegner activity score was 5 (range 1-9); the median Lysholm score was 96 (range 81-100); and the median subjective IKDC score was 94 (range 66-100). We reported 6/80 failures as revealed by a 2+ or 3+ pivot-shift test result and/or KT-1000 side-to-side difference of more than 5 mm. The IKDC score revealed excellent results in all women who underwent extra-articular tenodesis. Radiographic evaluation demonstrated early signs of osteoarthritis in 9% of patients.",

Fifty patients who underwent ACLR with versus without ALLR were analyzed at four different time points (preoperatively and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively). For the functional outcomes, muscle strength and acceleration time (AT) were measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. Proprioception was evaluated using joint position sense and dynamic postural stability. Patient-reported outcomes were measured using the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK-11) scores. Functional performance was assessed using single-leg hop distance (SLHD) and Limb Symmetry Index. In the operated knees, quadriceps (at 6 months postoperatively, p = 0.003) and hamstring (at 6 and 12 months postoperatively, p < 0.001) strength were significantly higher in the combined ACLR and ALLR group than the isolated ACLR group. The TSK-11 (at 6 and 12 months postoperatively, p < 0.001) was significantly lower in the combined ACLR and ALLR group than the isolated ACLR group. SLHD was significantly higher in the combined ACLR and ALLR group than the isolated ACLR group (at 6 months, p = 0.022 and at 12 months, p = 0.024).

Loss of LKB1 promotes cancer progression and influences therapeutic responses in preclinical studies; however, specific targeted therapies for lung cancer with LKB1 inactivation are currently unavailable. Here, we have identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) signature that is associated with the loss of LKB1 function. We discovered that LINC00473 is consistently the most highly induced gene in LKB1-inactivated human primary NSCLC samples and derived cell lines. Elevated LINC00473 expression correlated with poor prognosis, and sustained LINC00473 expression was required for the growth and survival of LKB1-inactivated NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, LINC00473 was induced by LKB1 inactivation and subsequent cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)/CREB-regulated transcription coactivator (CRTC) activation. We determined that LINC00473 is a nuclear lncRNA and interacts with NONO, a component of the cAMP signaling pathway, thereby facilitating CRTC/CREB-mediated transcription. Collectively, our study demonstrates that LINC00473 expression potentially serves as a robust biomarker for tumor LKB1 functional status that can be integrated into clinical trials for patient selection and treatment evaluation, and implicates LINC00473 as a therapeutic target for LKB1-inactivated NSCLC.",

The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00473 is increased in some human cancer tissues and it plays important roles in tumorigenesis. However, neither the expression pattern nor the biological functions of LINC00473 have been elucidated in cervical cancer so far. In the present study, gain- and loss-of-function assays showed that LINC00473 promoted cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis in cervical cancer cells in vitro. Moreover, we found that LINC00473 enhanced the growth of cervical cancer cells in vivo. Mechanistic investigation showed that LINC00473 directly interacted with ILF2 and suppressed its degradation. Finally, we demonstrated that miR-34a reduced the stability of LINC00473. These findings may have important implications for developing novel therapeutic strategies for cervical cancer.",
        "# Title: Long noncoding RNA LNC473 inhibits the ubiquitination of survivin via association with USP9X and enhances cell proliferation and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.\n# Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Recent studies reported that lncRNA LINC00473 (LNC473) was involved in cancer progression. However, the clinical significance and functional role of LNC473 in HCC progression is still unknown. In the present study, we found that the LNC473 expression was markedly elevated in HCC tissues and correlated with bigger tumor size, higher BCLC stage, vascular invasion and poor prognosis. Gain- and loss-of-function assay showed that LNC473 enhanced HCC cell proliferation and invasion and induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Mechanistically, LNC473 associated with oncoprotein survivin and regulates its stability. Moreover, LNC473 could recruit deubiquitinase USP9X to inhibit the ubiquitination level of survivin and then increase survivin expression. Therefore, our results suggest that LNC473 exerts its functions as an oncogene in HCC progression and may be a therapeutic target for HCC treatment.",
        "# Title: LINC00473 predicts poor prognosis and regulates cell migration and invasion in gastric cancer.\n# Abstract: LINC00473 is an intergenic long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and has been suggested to be dysregulated in several human cancers. However, the clinical value and biological function of LINC00473 in gastric cancer (GC) was still unknown. In our results, LINC00473 expression was increased in GC tissue samples and GC cell lines compared with paired adjacent normal stomach tissue samples and normal gastric epithelial cell line, respectively. High-expression of LINC00473 was correlated with poor histological type, advanced clinical stage, more lymph node metastasis and present distant metastasis. The results of Kaplan-Meier analysis and TCGA database similarly suggested that GC patients with LINC00473 high-expression had poorer prognosis than GC patients with LINC00473 low-expression. Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that LINC00473 high-expression served as independent unfavorable prognostic factor for overall survival in GC patients. The study in vitro indicated that silencing of LINC00473 had no effect on GC cell viability, but inhibited GC cell migration and invasion through modulating MMP2 and MMP9 expression. In conclusion, LINC00473 is associated with the malignant status and prognosis in GC cases, and functions as an oncogenic lncRNA to regulate GC cell migration and invasion.",

        "# Title: Long noncoding RNA LINC00473 functions as a competing endogenous RNA to regulate MAPK1 expression by sponging miR-198 in breast cancer.\n# Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) is one of the primary tumors with high incidence in women. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of LINC00473 and underlying mechanisms in BC. Expression pattern of LINC00473 was analyzed using qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) assays in BC tissues and cells. Overexpression or knockdown of LINC00473 in vitro and functional experiments were performed to study its effects on BC cells. Target prediction, luciferase assays, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and RNA immunoprecipitation were used to verify the role of LINC00473 as a competing endogenous RNA. The impact of LINC00473 on tumor growth was also evaluated using a xenograft model. In our study, we found that LINC00473 was highly expressed in BC tissues and cells, and the elevated expression was correlated with shorter overall survival in patients with BC. Furthermore, knockdown of LINC00473 significantly inhibited the capacity of proliferation, invasion and migration of BC cells. Animal experiment suggested that silencing LINC00473 could significantly inhibit the tumor growth. Following experiments revealed that LINC00473 may function as a competing endogenous RNA to regulate the expression of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1 (MAPK1) through competition for miR-198. Thus, increased expression of LINC00473 in breast cancer tissues is linked to poor prognosis. LINC00473 may function as an endogenous completive RNA by sponging miR-198 to regulate MAPK1 expression. Findings of our study contributed to the basis for further exploring the application of LINC00473 as a prognostic and diagnostic biomarker.",
        "# Title: Long non‑coding RNA LINC00473/miR‑195‑5p promotes glioma progression via YAP1‑TEAD1‑Hippo signaling.\n# Abstract: There is an urgent need to identify novel potential therapeutic targets for diagnosis and treatment of glioma, a common primary tumor in brain, due to its high‑level invasiveness. Long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00473 has been reported as potentially critical regulators in various types of cancer tumorigenesis. However, the effects of LINC00473 on glioma cells is unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the clinical significance, effects and mechanism of LINC00437 on glioma tumorigenesis. In the present study, LINC00473 was significantly increased in glioma tissues and in cell models, and predicted a poor prognosis in patients with glioma. Notably, LINC00473 knockdown not only suppressed cell proliferation, invasion and migration of glioma cells, but also blocked cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis. Subcutaneous xenotransplanted tumor model experiments revealed that reduced LINC00473 expression was able to suppress in vivo glioma growth. Mechanistically, LINC00473 functioned as a competing endogenous (ce)RNA to decrease microRNA (miR)‑195‑5p expression. Moreover, Yes‑associated protein 1 (YAP1) and TEA domain family member 1 (TEAD1) were identified as downstream targets of miR‑195‑5p, whose expression levels were inhibited by miR‑195‑5p. LINC00473 knockdown suppressed glioma progression through the decrease of miR‑195‑5p and subsequent increase of YAP1 and TEAD1 expression levels. These results indicated LINC00473 might act as a ceRNA to sponge miR‑195‑5p, thus promoting YAP1 and TEAD1 expressions, and shedding light on the underlying mechanisms of LINC00473‑induced glioma progression.",
        "# Title: LINC00473 contributes to the radioresistance of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by regulating microRNA‑497‑5p and cell division cycle 25A.\n# Abstract: Long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00473 plays a carcinogenic role in a variety of different tumor types. Nevertheless, the mechanisms through which LINC00473 regulates the radiosensitivity of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells remains elusive. In the present study, reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR was used to quantify the expression of LINC00473, microRNA (miRNA/miR)‑497‑5p and cell division cycle 25A (CDC25A) in ESCC tissues. The association between LINC00473 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with ESCC was also assessed. Furthermore, Cell Counting kit‑8 and colony formation assays were carried out to monitor the proliferation of ESCC cells exposed to X‑ray radiation. A dual‑luciferase reporter assay was also conducted to analyze the interaction between LINC00473 and miR‑497‑5p, as well as the interaction between CDC25A and miR‑497‑5p. The findings of the present study demonstrated that in ESCC tissues and cells, the expression levels of LINC00473 and CDC25A were significantly upregulated, while the expression of miR‑497‑5p was downregulated. The high expression level of LINC00473 was associated with a higher T stage, lymph node metastasis stage and a lower tumor differentiation grade in patients with ESCC. Following irradiation, transfection with miR‑497‑5p mimics reduced the promoting effect of LINC00473 overexpression on ESCC cell proliferation, and partially impeded the resistance of ESCC cells to X‑ray radiation induced by LINC00473 overexpression. Moreover, transfection with miR‑497‑5p inhibitors partially alleviated the inhibitory effects of LINC00473 knockdown on cellular proliferation, and partly reversed the sensitivity of cells to X‑ray irradiation induced by LINC00473 knockdown. Furthermore, it was confirmed that miR‑497‑5p was able to bind LINC00473 and the 3'‑untranslated region of CDC25A. On the whole, the findings of the present study demonstrate that LINC00473 reduces the radiosensitivity of ESCC cells by modulating the miR‑497‑5p/CDC25A axis.",

        "# Title: LNC473 Regulating APAF1 IRES-Dependent Translation via Competitive Sponging miR574 and miR15b: Implications in Colorectal Cancer.\n# Abstract: A growing number of studies have focused on the involvement of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in the internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated translation in tumorigenesis; however, the underlying mechanisms in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain elusive. In this study, we show that LINC00473 (LNC473) exerted its functions as a tumor suppressor in promoting apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF1) IRES activity through competitively sponging miR574-5p and miR15b-5p in CRC initiation and pathogenesis. Specifically, LNC473 and its downstream target APAF1 were significantly downregulated accompanied by upregulated miR574-5p and miR15b-5p in CRC cells and tissues, which had a significant prognostic impact on clinical outcomes in our CRC cohort (n = 157). Furthermore, ectopic LNC473 significantly sponged endogenous miR574-5p or miR15b-5p and thereby inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation capacity, and it accelerated cell apoptosis through activating the APAF1-CASP9-CASP3 pathway. Notably, LNC473 overexpression resulted in dramatic promotion of APAF1 IRES activity and translation, whereas rescue experiments confirmed the recovery by the existence of LNC473 and miR574/15b-5p. Mechanistically, LNC473 overexpression promoted IRES binding domain exposure and removed the constraints controlling from miR574-5p and miR15b-5p, and subsequently enhanced IRES-mediated APAF1 expression in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, our results uncover a novel LNC473-miR574/miR15b-APAF1 signaling axis, which provides new targets and crosstalk regulation mechanism for CRC prevention and treatment.",
        "# Title: Knockdown of LINC00473 promotes radiosensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer cells via sponging miR-513a-3p.\n# Abstract: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung cancer. Radioresistance is a significant obstacle in NSCLC radiotherapy. Long non-coding RNA LINC00473 has been found to impact the radiotherapy in several malignant tumours. This study aimed to investigate the underlying role and mechanism of LINC00473 in regulating radiosensitivity of NSCLC cells. The levels of LINC00473 and miR-513a-3p were measured by quantitative Real-Time PCR. The relationship of LINC00473 with overall survival was tested by the Kaplan-Meier method. The effects of LINC00473 on cell viability and cell survival were assessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony survival assay in NSCLC cells exposed to different doses of radiation. A luciferase reporter assay was used to investigate the correlation between LINC00473 and miR-513a-3p. The present study showed that the relative LINC00473 expression was upregulated and miR-513a-3p expression was downregulated in radioresistant NSCLC patients compared with radiosensitive patients. And upregulated LINC00473 expression was associated with poor prognosis of NSCLC patients after radiotherapy. Radiation led to an increase in LINC00473 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The knockdown of LINC00473 markedly promoted radiosensitivity in NSCLC cells under different doses of radiation. LINC00473 was a sponge of miR-513a-3p and negatively regulated the miR-513a-3p expression. In conclusion, the inhibition of miR-513a-3p markedly reversed the promoted effect of LINC00473 knockdown on cell radiosensitivity. LINC00473 inhibition enhances radiosensitivity of NSCLC by sponging miR-513a-3p, providing a promising therapeutic target to increase the sensitivity of radiotherapy in NSCLC patients.",
        "# Title: lncRNA LINC00473 promotes proliferation, migration, invasion and inhibition of apoptosis of non-small cell lung cancer cells by acting as a sponge of miR-497-5p.\n# Abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-associated death worldwide and exhibits a poor prognosis. The present study aimed to determine the effect of long non-coding (lnc)RNA-LINC00473 on the development of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells by regulating the expression of microRNA (miR)-497-5p. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was conducted to detect the level of LINC00473 and miR-497-5p. An MTT assay, flow cytometry and Transwell tests were performed to evaluate the proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells. Western blotting was performed to detect the expression of apoptosis- and migration-related proteins. RNA immunoprecipitation and a luciferase reporter assay were performed to verify the regulatory relationship between lncRNA-LINC00473 and miR-497-5p. LINC00473 expression was upregulated in lung cancer tissues and NSCLC cells (A549 and H1299) when compared with adjacent tissues or human bronchial epithelial cell lines and the 5-year survival rate was lower in patients with high LINC00473 expression compared with in patients with low LINC00473 expression. A negative correlation between LINC00473 and miR-497-5p was observed in lung cancer tissues. Proliferation, migration and invasion as well as the related protein levels were increased in A549 and H1299 transfected with pcDNA3.1-LINC00473, while the opposite results were obtained in A549 and H1299 transfected with small interfering (si)-LINC00473. Notably, it was demonstrated that LINC00473 could bind directly with miR-497-5p and inhibit its expression. miR-497-5p inhibitors reversed the effect of si-LINC00473. Furthermore, the present study demonstrated that LINC00473 promoted the malignant behaviour of NSCLC cells via regulating the ERK/p38 and MAPK signalling pathways and the expression of miR-497-5p.",
        "# Title: Long intergenic non-coding RNA 00473 promotes proliferation and migration of gastric cancer via the miR-16-5p/CCND2 axis and by regulating AQP3.\n# Abstract: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, but its molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Increasing evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) play a pivotal role in various cancers recently. Our present study focused on exploring the function of long intergenic non-coding RNA 00473 (LINC00473) in GC. In this study, we found that LINC00473 expression was aberrantly increased in tumor tissues compared with the paired para-cancerous tissues. The expression of high LINC00473 in GC was notably correlated with a higher risk of lymphatic metastasis, a higher incidence of vascular cancer embolus, and advanced TNM stage. Further experiments showed that the overexpression of LINC00473 could promote the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells both in vitro and in vivo. The apoptosis of GC cells increased significantly by the decrease of LINC00473. Mechanistically, LINC00473 could sponge miR-16-5p in the cytoplasm and relieve its suppression of CCND2. Moreover, AQP3 was found to be a significant downstream target gene for LINC00473 through RNA transcriptome sequencing, as demonstrated by qRT-PCR and western blot. Overexpression of LINC00473 can partially reverse the effects of AQP3 decrease on GC proliferation and metastasis. LINC00473 regulated AQP3 expression through CREB was confirmed by western blot. Our research indicates that LINC00473/miR-16-5p/CCND2 axis plays a role in the proliferation of GC and modulates AQP3 to influence GC cell metastasis, making it a potential therapeutic target for GC."

Our approach in vaccine development uses recombinant expression of the highly immunogenic HAV antigen VP1-P2a in food-grade lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis and in Escherichia coli. We used genetic constructs that enable nisin-controlled expression of the antigen in L. lactis in three different forms: (a) intracellularly, (b) on the bacterial surface and (c) on the bacterial surface fused with the fragment of the E. coli flagellin molecule that can act as a molecular adjuvant. Expression of the two surface forms of the antigen was achieved in L. lactis, and the resulting antigen-displaying bacteria were administered orally to mice. Half the animals in each of the two groups developed specific IgGs, with titers increasing over time and reaching 1:422 without flagellin and 1:320 with flagellin. A much higher titer 1:25,803 was observed with the parenterally administered antigen, which was purified from E. coli. With the latter, a significant mucosal IgA response was also observed. Despite significant titers, the IgGs elicited with oral or parenteral administration could not prevent HAV from infecting cells in a virus neutralization assay, suggesting that the antibodies cannot recognize viral surface epitopes. Nevertheless, orally administered HAV antigen expressed in L. lactis elicited significant systemic humoral immune response showing the feasibility for development of effective HAV vaccine for mucosal delivery.",
        "# Title: Oral immunization with recombinant Lactococcus lactis delivering a multi-epitope antigen CTB-UE attenuates Helicobacter pylori infection in mice.\n# Abstract: Urease is an essential virulence factor and colonization factor for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and is considered as an excellent vaccine candidate antigen. However, conventional technologies for preparing an injectable vaccine require purification of the antigenic protein and preparation of an adjuvant. Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 (L. lactis) could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of edible vaccine. In previous study, we constructed a multi-epitope vaccine, designated CTB-UE, which is composed of the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), three Th cell epitopes and two B-cell epitopes from urease subunits. To develop a novel type of oral vaccine against H. pylori, genetically modified L. lactis strains were established to secrete this epitope vaccine extracellularly in this study. Oral prophylactic immunization with recombinant L. lactis significantly elicited humoral anti-urease antibody responses (P < 0.001) and reduced the gastric colonization of H. pylori from 7.14 ± 0.95 to 4.68 ± 0.98 log10 CFU g(-1) stomach. This L. lactis oral vaccine offers a promising vaccine candidate for the control of H. pylori infection.",
        "# Title: Development of a new DNA vaccine based on mycobacterial ESAT-6 antigen delivered by recombinant invasive Lactococcus lactis FnBPA+.\n# Abstract: The use of the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis as a vehicle for the oral delivery of DNA vaccine plasmids constitutes a promising strategy for vaccination. The delivery of DNA plasmids into eukaryotic cells is of critical importance for subsequent DNA expression and effectiveness of the vaccine. In this context, the use of the recombinant invasive L. lactis FnBPA+ (fibronectin-binding protein A) strain for the oral delivery of the eukaryotic expression vector vaccination using lactic acid bacteria (pValac), coding for the 6-kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6) gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, could represent a new DNA vaccine strategy against tuberculosis. To this end, the ESAT-6 sequence was cloned into the pValac vector; the L. lactis fibronectin-binding protein A (FnBPA)+ (pValac:ESAT-6) strain was obtained, and its immunological profile was checked in BALB/c mice. This strain was able to significantly increase interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production in spleen cells, showing a systemic T helper 1 (Th1) cell response. The mice also showed a significant increase in specific secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) production in colon tissue and fecal extracts. Thus, this is the first time that L. lactis has been used to deliver a plasmid DNA harboring a gene that encodes an antigen against tuberculosis through mucous membranes.",
        "# Title: Lactococcus lactis displayed neuraminidase confers cross protective immunity against influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Influenza A viruses pose a serious threat to public health. Current influenza A vaccines predominantly focus on hemagglutinin (HA) and show strain-specific protection. Neuraminidase (NA) is much less studied in the context of humoral immunity against influenza A viruses. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cross protective immunity of NA presented on Lactococcus lactis (L.lactis) surface against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in the mouse model. L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA was constructed in which pgsA was used as an anchor protein. Mice vaccinated orally with L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA could elicit significant NA-specific serum IgG and mucosa IgA antibodies, as well as neuraminidase inhibition (NI) titers. Importantly, L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA provided 80% protection against H5N1, 60% protection against H3N2 and H1N1, respectively. These findings suggest that recombinant L.lactis/pNZ110-pgsA-NA in the absence of adjuvant via oral administration can be served as an effective vaccine candidate against diverse strains of influenza A viruses.",
        "# Title: Broadly protective immunity against divergent influenza viruses by oral co-administration of Lactococcus lactis expressing nucleoprotein adjuvanted with cholera toxin B subunit in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines need to be annually reformulated to well match the predicated circulating strains. Thus, it is critical for developing a novel universal influenza vaccine that would be able to confer cross-protection against constantly emerging divergent influenza virus strains. Influenza virus A is a genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses. Influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) is a structural protein which encapsidates the negative strand viral RNA, and anti-NP antibodies play role in cross-protective immunity. Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) is an ideal vaccine delivery vehicle via oral administration route. However, L. lactis vectored vaccine exhibits poor immunogenicity without the use of mucosal adjuvant. To enhance the immunogenicity of L. lactis vectored vaccine, cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit, one of mucosal adjuvants, is a safe adjuvant for oral route, when combined with L. lactis vectored vaccine. In this study, we hypothesized that pNZ8008, a L. lactis expression plasmid, encoding NP antigen, would be able to elicit cross-protection with the use of CTB via oral administration route.",
        "# Title: Cross-protection of Lactococcus lactis-displayed HA2 subunit against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines provide strain-specific protection against homologous subtypes and need to be updated annually. Therefore, it is essential to develop a universal vaccine that would induce broadly cross-protective immunity against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses. The highly conserved HA2 subunit is a promising candidate for developing a universal influenza vaccine. Here, we hypothesized that the HA2 subunit could be displayed on the surface of Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis), using Spax as an anchor protein (L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2) and that L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 would have immunogenicity by oral administration without the use of adjuvant in the mouse model. To address this hypothesis, we show that oral vaccination of mice with L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 elicited significant humoral and mucosal immune responses. Importantly, L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 provided 100% protection against homologous H5N1 or heterologous H1N1 virus challenge. These results suggest that an HA2 subunit presented on the surface of L. lactis is an effective universal vaccine candidate against influenza A viruses in the poultry industry and in humans.",
        "# Title: Oral Immunization with a Recombinant Lactococcus lactis-Expressing HIV-1 Antigen on Group A Streptococcus Pilus Induces Strong Mucosal Immunity in the Gut.\n# Abstract: The induction of a potent humoral and cellular immune response in mucosal tissue is important for the development of an effective HIV vaccine. Most of the current HIV vaccines under development use the i.m. route for immunization, which is relatively poor in generating potent and long-lived mucosal immune responses. In this article, we explore the ability of an oral vaccination with a probiotic organism, Lactococcus lactis, to elicit HIV-specific immune responses in the mucosal and systemic compartments of BALB/c mice. We expressed the HIV-1 Gag-p24 on the tip of the T3 pilus of Streptococcus pyogenes as a fusion to the Cpa protein (LL-Gag). After four monthly LL-Gag oral immunizations, we observed strong Gag-specific IgG and IgA responses in serum, feces, and vaginal secretions. However, the Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses in the blood were at or below our detection limit. After an i.m. modified vaccinia Ankara/Gag boost, we observed robust Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses both in systemic and in mucosal tissues, including intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes of the small intestine, Peyer's patches, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Consistent with strong immunogenicity, the LL-Gag induced activation of CD11c(+) CD11b(+) dendritic cells in the Peyer's patches after oral immunization. Our results demonstrate that oral immunization with L. lactis expressing an Ag on the tip of the group A Streptococcus pilus serves as an excellent vaccine platform to induce strong mucosal humoral and cellular immunity against HIV.",

        "# Title: Production and delivery of Helicobacter pylori NapA in Lactococcus lactis and its protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity.\n# Abstract: Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein A subunit (NapA) has been identified as a virulence factor, a protective antigen and a potent immunomodulator. NapA shows unique application potentials for anti-H. pylori vaccines and treatment strategies of certain allergic diseases and carcinomas. However, appropriate production and utilization modes of NapA still remain uncertain to date. This work has established a novel efficient production and utilization mode of NapA by using L. lactis as an expression host and delivery vector, and demonstrated immune protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity of the engineered L. lactis by oral vaccination of mice. It was observed for the first time that H. pylori NapA promotes both polarized Th17 and Th1 responses, which may greatly affect the clinical application of NapA. This report offers a promising anti-H. pylori oral vaccine candidate and a potent mucosal immune modulatory agent. Meanwhile, it uncovers a way to produce and deliver the oral vaccine and immunomodulator by fermentation of food like milk, which might have striking effects on control of H. pylori infection, gastrointestinal cancers, and Th2 bias allergic diseases, including many food allergies.",
        "# Title: Protective immunity induced by an intranasal multivalent vaccine comprising 10 Lactococcus lactis strains expressing highly prevalent M-protein antigens derived from Group A Streptococcus.\n# Abstract: Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) causes diseases ranging from mild pharyngitis to severe invasive infections. The N-terminal fragment of streptococcal M protein elicits protective antibodies and is an attractive vaccine target. However, this N- terminal fragment is hypervariable: there are more than 200 different M types. In this study, an intranasal live bacterial vaccine comprising 10 strains of Lactococcus lactis, each expressing one N-terminal fragment of M protein, has been developed. Live bacterial-vectored vaccines cost less to manufacture because the processes involved are less complex than those required for production of protein subunit vaccines. Moreover, intranasal administration does not require syringes or specialized personnel. Evaluation of individual vaccine types (M1, M2, M3, M4, M6, M9, M12, M22, M28 and M77) showed that most of them protected mice against challenge with virulent S. pyogenes. All 10 strains combined in a 10-valent vaccine (M×10) induced serum and bronchoalveolar lavage IgG titers that ranged from three- to 10-fold those of unimmunized mice. After intranasal challenge with M28 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice was significantly higher than that of unimmunized mice. In contrast, when mice were challenged with M75 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice did not differ significantly from that of unimmunized mice. Mx-10 immunized mice had significantly less S. pyogenes in oropharyngeal washes and developed less severe disease symptoms after challenge than did unimmunized mice. Our L. lactis-based vaccine may provide an alternative solution to development of broadly protective group A streptococcal vaccines.",
        "# Title: Mucosal and systemic immune responses elicited by recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a fusion protein composed of pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin from Bordetella pertussis.\n# Abstract: We constructed a food-grade expression system harboring a F1S1 fusion protein of Bordetella pertussis to be produced in Lactococcus lactis NZ3900 as a new oral vaccine model against whooping cough, caused by B. pertussis. F1S1 was composed of N-terminally truncated S1 subunit of pertussis toxin and type I immunodominant domain of filamentous hemagglutinin which are both known as protective immunogens against pertussis. The recombinant L. lactis was administered via oral or intranasal routes to BALB/c mice and the related specific systemic and mucosal immune responses were then evaluated. The results indicated significantly higher levels of specific IgA in the lung extracts and IgG in sera of mucosally-immunized mice, compared to their controls. It was revealed that higher levels of IgG2a, compared to IgG1, were produced in all mucosally-immunized mice. Moreover, immunized mice developed Th1 responses with high levels of IFN-γ production by the spleen cells. These findings provide evidence for L. lactis to be used as a suitable vehicle for expression and delivery of F1S1 fusion protein to mucosa and induction of appropriate systemic and mucosal immune responses against pertussis.",
        "# Title: Rotavirus VP6 protein mucosally delivered by cell wall-derived particles from Lactococcus lactis induces protection against infection in a murine model.\n# Abstract: Rotaviruses are the primary cause of acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide. Although the implementation of live attenuated vaccines has reduced the number of rotavirus-associated deaths, variance in their effectiveness has been reported in different countries. This fact, among other concerns, leads to continuous efforts for the development of new generation of vaccines against rotavirus.In this work, we describe the obtention of cell wall-derived particles from a recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a cell wall-anchored version of the rotavirus VP6 protein. After confirming by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, flow cytometry and electronic immunomicroscopy that these particles were carrying the VP6 protein, their immunogenic potential was evaluated in adult BALB/c mice. For that, mucosal immunizations (oral or intranasal), with or without the dmLT [(double mutant Escherichia coli heat labile toxin LT(R192G/L211A)] adjuvant were performed. The results showed that these cell wall-derived particles were able to generate anti-rotavirus IgG and IgA antibodies only when administered intranasally, whether the adjuvant was present or not. However, the presence of dmLT was necessary to confer protection against rotavirus infection, which was evidenced by a 79.5 percent viral shedding reduction.In summary, this work describes the production of cell wall-derived particles which were able to induce a protective immune response after intranasal immunization. Further studies are needed to characterize the immune response elicited by these particles as well as to determine their potential as an alternative to the use of live L. lactis for mucosal antigen delivery.",

Thereafter, in order to assess the immunogenicity of recombinant L. lactis cells, C57BL/6 mice were immunized by oral gavage.",
        "# Title: A Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB)-Based Vaccine Candidate for Human Norovirus.\n# Abstract: Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are responsible for more than 95% of the non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis epidemics in the world. The CDC estimates that every year 21 million individuals suffer from HuNoV-induced gastroenteritis in the United States. Currently, there is no FDA-approved vaccine for HuNoVs. Development of an effective vaccine has been hampered by the lack of an efficient cell culture system for HuNoVs and a suitable small animal model for pathogenesis study. In this study, we developed lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as a vector to deliver HuNoV antigen. A LAB strain (Lactococcus lactis) carrying VP1 gene of a HuNoV GII.4 virus (LAB-VP1) was constructed. It was found that HuNoV VP1 protein was highly expressed by LAB vector and was secreted into media supernatants. To test whether LAB-based HuNoV vaccine candidate is immunogenic, 4-day-old gnotobiotic piglets were orally inoculated with various doses of LAB-VP1. It was found that LABs were persistent in the small intestine of piglets and shed in pig feces for at least 25 days post inoculation. LAB DNA and VP1 were detected in mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen tissue in LAB-VP1 inoculated groups. HuNoV-specific IgG and IgA were detectable in serum and feces respectively at day 13 post-inoculation, and further increased at later time points. After being challenged with HuNoV GII.4 strain, a large amount of HuNoV antigens were observed in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum sections of the intestine in the LAB control group. In contrast, significantly less, or no, HuNoV antigens were detected in the LAB-VP1 immunized groups. Collectively, these results demonstrate that a LAB-based HuNoV vaccine induces protective immunity in gnotobiotic piglets.",

        "# Title: Mucosal Vaccination with Lactococcus lactis-Secreting Surface Immunological Protein Induces Humoral and Cellular Immune Protection against Group B Streptococcus in a Murine Model.\n# Abstract: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the primary etiological agent of sepsis and meningitis in newborns and is associated with premature birth and stillbirth. The development of a licensed vaccine is one of the pending challenges for the World Health Organization. Previously, we showed that oral immunization with surface immune protein (SIP) decreases vaginal colonization of GBS and generates functional opsonizing antibodies, which was determined by opsonophagocytic assays (OPA) in vitro. We also showed that the protein has an adjuvant vaccine profile. Therefore, an oral vaccine based on SIP may be an attractive alternative to employ in the development of new vaccines against GBS. Lactococcus lactis is a highlighted oral vaccine probiotic inducer of the mucosal immune response. This bacterium could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of an edible vaccine and has been used in clinical trials. In this study, we showed that an oral vaccine with a recombinant L. lactis strain secreting SIP from GBS (rL. lactis-SIP) can induce protective humoral and cellular immunity in an experimental model of GBS vaginal colonization in C57BL/6 mice. Mice immunized with rL. lactis-SIP were protected against clinical symptoms and bacterial colonization after GBS vaginal colonization. Our rL. lactis-SIP vaccine also induces an increase of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) specifically against SIP. The adoptive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice to naïve mice generated protection against GBS vaginal colonization. Moreover, the rL. lactis-SIP strain induces the activation of SIP-specific T cells, which could decrease GBS vaginal colonization and generate protective antibodies when transferred to other mice. Our experimental observations strongly support the notion that rL. lactis-SIP induces protective humoral and cellular immunity and could be considered as a novel alternative in the development of vaccines for GBS.",
        "# Title: Recombinant Lactococcus Lactis Displaying Omp31 Antigen of Brucella melitensis Can Induce an Immunogenic Response in BALB/c Mice.\n# Abstract: Since Brucella infection mostly occurs through the mucosal surfaces, immune response induced by vaccine that is delivered by a way of mucosal route can be drastically enhanced to control the brucellosis. Omp31is the major outer membrane protein of Brucella, and is considered as a protective antigen against Brucella infection. Accordingly, Lactococcus lactis has been used as an antigen-delivering vector to develop a vaccine-induced mucosal response for having a safer vaccination against brucellosis. A designed omp31 gene fused to the usp45 signal peptide and M6 cell wall anchor was sub cloned in the pNZ7021 expression vector, and a recombinant L. lactis displaying Omp31 was constructed. Omp31 protein expression was confirmed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. Animals were orally and intraperitoneally immunized with live or killed L. lactis expressing Omp31, respectively. The humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated by measuring the specific cytokines and antibodies. sIgA, serum IgA, IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in the mice immunized with live recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31 and also serum IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in mice immunized with killed recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31. Among IgG subtypes, IgG2a response was significantly higher in both groups compared to IgG1. In mice groups immunized with recombinant L. lactis, the IFN-γ and IL-10 level elevated; however, there was no change in the level of IL-4. These results indicated that recombinants L. lactis induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, and also vaccines based on L. lactis-derived live carriers are promising interventions against Brucella melitensis infections.",
        "# Title: Lactococcus lactis FNBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) Induces Cellular and Humoral Immune Responses After Oral Immunization of Mice.\n# Abstract: The development of a new vaccine strategy against tuberculosis is urgently needed and has been greatly encouraged by the scientific community worldwide. In this work, we constructed a lactococcal DNA vaccine based on the fusion of two Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens, ESAT-6 and Ag85A, and examined its immunogenicity. The coding sequences of the ESAT-6 and Ag85A genes were fused and cloned into the eukaryotic expression pValac vector, and the functionality of the vector was confirmed in vitro. Then, L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) was obtained and used for oral immunization of mice. This strain induced significant increases in IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-17 cytokines in stimulated splenocyte cultures, and significant production of antigen-specific sIgA was observed in the colonic tissues of immunized mice. We demonstrated that L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) generated a cellular and humoral immune response after oral immunization of mice. The strategy developed in this work may represent an interesting DNA mucosal vaccine candidate against tuberculosis, using the fusion of two highly immunogenic antigens delivered by safe lactic acid bacteria.",
        "# Title: Protective Immunity Against Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli by Oral Vaccination of Engineered Lactococcus lactis.\n# Abstract: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the leading causes of diarrhea in children globally, and thus suitable vaccines are desired. Antigen display on lactic acid bacteria is a reliable approach for efficient oral vaccination and preventing bowel diseases. To develop an oral vaccine against ETEC, the gene of the binding domain from heat-labile toxin (LTB), a key ETEC virulence factor, was codon-optimized and cloned into a construct containing a signal peptide and an anchor for display on L. lactis. Bioinformatics analysis showed a codon adaptation index of 0.95 for the codon-optimized gene. Cell surface expression of LTB was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and blotting. White New Zealand rabbits were immunized per os (PO) with the recombinant L. lactis, and the antibody titers were assayed with ELISA. In vitro neutralization assay was performed using mouse adrenal tumor cells and rabbit ileal loop test was performed as the in vivo assay. ELISA results indicated that oral administration of the engineered L. lactis elicited a significant production of IgA in the intestine. In vitro neutralization assay showed that the effect of the toxin could be neutralized with 500 µg/ml of IgG isolated from the oral vaccine group. Furthermore, the dose of ETEC causing fluid accumulation in the ileal loop test showed a tenfold increase in rabbits immunized with either recombinant L. lactis or LTB protein compared to other groups. Our results imply that recombinant L. lactis could potentially be an effective live oral vaccine against ETEC toxicity.",
        "# Title: Oral Immunization of Mice with Cell Extracts from Recombinant Lactococcus lactis Expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein.\n# Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all over the world and became a pandemic that named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). At present, several intramuscular vaccines have been successfully developed and mass vaccination has progressed in many countries. The aim of the study is to develop and examine an oral vaccine against COVID-19 with recombinant Lactococcus lactis IL1403, a strain of lactic acid bacteria, expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) S1 subunit as an immunizing antigen. PBS or cell extracts from recombinant L. lactis were orally administered into mice (control VS treatment), and formation of antigen-specific antibodies and changes in the gut microbiome were analyzed. Intracellular antigen was detected, but its secretion was not successful. After immunization, antigen-specific serum IgG and fecal IgA levels were 1.5-fold (P = 0.002) and 1.4-fold (P = 0.016) higher in the immunized mice (treatment) than control, respectively. Gut microbiome profiles were clearly separated between the two groups when analyzed for beta diversity with overall similarity. At the genus level, while Coprococcus (P = 0.036) and unclassified genus of Ruminococcaceae (P = 0.037) in treatment were more abundant than control, rc4-4 (P = 0.013) and Stenotrophomonas (P = 0.021) were less abundant. Our results indicate that cell extract containing SARS-CoV-2 antigen can induce mice to produce antigen-specific antibodies without overall changes in the gut microbiome. This strategy may be useful for the development of other oral viral vaccines.",
        "# Title: Oral Immunization With a M Cell-Targeting Recombinant L. Lactis Vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE Stimulate Protective Immunity Against H. Pylori in Mice.\n# Abstract: There are many virulence factors of H. pylori that contribute in diverse ways to gastric disease. Therefore, designing multivalent epitope vaccines against many key virulence factors virulence factors of H. pylori is a promising strategy to control H. pylori infection. In previous studies, we constructed a multivalent epitope vaccine FVpE against four key virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), and oral immunization with the FVpE vaccine plus a polysaccharide adjuvant (PA) containing lycium barbarum polysaccharide and chitosan could provide protection against H. pylori infection in the Mongolian gerbil model. Oral vaccines have many advantages over injected vaccines, such as improved safety and compliance, and easier manufacturing and administration. However, the harsh gastrointestinal (GI) environment, such as gastric acid and proteolytic enzymes, limits the development of oral vaccines to some extent. Oral vaccines need a gastrointestinal delivery system with high safety, low price and promoting vaccine antigen to stimulate immune response in the gastrointestinal mucosa. Lactic acid bacteria are gastrointestinal probiotics that have unique advantages as a delivery system for oral vaccines. In this study, a M cell-targeting surface display system for L. lactis named plSAM was designed to help vaccine antigens to stimulate effective immune responses in the gastrointestinal tract, and a M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE was constructed by using the surface display system plSAM. recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE could secretively express the SAM-FVpE protein and display it on the bacterial surface. Moreover, experimental results confirmed that LL-plSAM-FVpE had an enhanced M cell-targeting property. In addition, LL-plSAM-FVpE had excellent M cell-targeting property to promote the phagocytosis and transport of the antigen SAM-FVpE by gastrointestinal M cells. More importantly, oral immunization of LL-plSAM-FVpE or SAM-FVpE plus PA can stimulate IgG and sIgA antibodies and CD4+ T cell immune responses against four virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), thus providing protective immunity against H. pylori infection in mice. The M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine against various key H. pylori virulence factors could be a promising vaccine candidate for controlling H. pylori infection.",
        "# Title: Oral and intranasal immunization with food-grade recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing high conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein triggers mice's immunity responses.\n# Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic began at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread throughout the world. Vaccination is still the most effective method of prevention of pathogenic infections, including viral infections. However, there is little evidence that vaccination can protect against SARS-CoV-2 virus for a long time. Thus, regular re-vaccination is necessary to control COVID-19. Vaccination by injection is invasive, and is one of the reasons people refuse to get re-vaccinated. Therefore, we developed a less invasive vaccine based on oral or nasal administration. The gene encoding the high conserved region (HCR) spike protein was inserted into pNZ8149 and expressed in L.lactis NZ3900. Mice were immunized at 3-week intervals with oral or nasal routes. Anti-SARS-CoV2 spike antibody (IgG and IgA) level were measured using ELISA method before and after treatment. Plasma cells population in lymph were analyzed using flowcytometry and the CD4 + and CD8 + cells in lymph and intestine were analyzed using immunofluorescence method. The results of nasal and oral administration in experimental animals showed that L.lactis carrying the HCR gene could induce a humoral immune response, as indicated by increased levels of IgG and IgA against SARS-CoV-2 (IgG/IgA-SARS-CoV-2). The plasma cell population after nasal and oral vaccination in mice were significantly different with control group (p < 0.05). The CD4 + and CD8 + cells in intestine were significantly higher in orally immunized group mice than control group. The CD8 + cells in lymph were significantly higher in intranasal immunized group mice than control group. Our data demonstrate L.lactis expressing spike protein can be developed into a less invasive alternative to nasal and oral vaccination.",
        "# Title: Expanding strain coverage of a group A Streptococcus pilus-expressing Lactococcus lactis mucosal vaccine.\n# Abstract: Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a human pathogenic bacterium that can trigger a wide range of diseases, including the autoimmune diseases acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, causing major morbidity and mortality in many low- and middle-income countries. Primary intervention programs have had limited success thus far, and a licensed vaccine has yet to be developed. The pilus of GAS is known to be involved in host cell adhesion, biofilm formation and immune evasion. We have a mucosal vaccine in development that expresses the pilus of GAS on the surface of the nonpathogenic bacterium Lactococcus lactis. To expand strain coverage, we combined seven L. lactis constructs, each expressing a different GAS pilus variant, and investigated the systemic and mucosal immune responses following immunization. Mice immunized with this combination showed specific immunoglobin G and immunoglobin A responses to the GAS pilus proteins of vaccine strains, at levels comparable to mice immunized with a single construct. Cross-reactivity to pilus proteins of nonvaccine strains was also evident. Furthermore, protective efficacy against a homologous strain of GAS in a murine nasopharyngeal colonization model was observed. Overall, this study provides further evidence for using pilus-expressing lactic acid bacteria as a vaccine to prevent upper respiratory tract GAS infections."

        "# Title: Long-term CD4+ T-cell response to highly active antiretroviral therapy according to baseline CD4+ T-cell count.\n# Abstract: Current treatment guidelines for HIV infection recommend a relatively late initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Nevertheless, there is still a concern that immune recovery may not be as complete once CD4+ T cells have decreased below a certain threshold. This study addressed the long-term response of CD4+ T-cell counts in patients on HAART and analyzed the influence of baseline CD4+ T-cell counts, baseline viral load, and age. An observational analysis of evolution of CD4+ T cells in 861 antiretroviral therapy-naive chronic HIV-1-infected patients who started treatment consisting of at least 3 drugs in or after 1996 was performed. Patients were classified in 4 groups according to baseline CD4+ T cells: <200 cells/mm3, 200-349 cells/mm3, 350-499 cells/mm3, and >or=500 cells/mm3. The main outcome measures were proportion of patients with CD4+ T cells <200/mm3 and >500/mm3 at last determination and rate of CD4+ T-cell recovery. Patients were followed-up for a median of 173 weeks (interquartile range [IQR], 100-234). There were no differences in follow-up between the 4 groups. CD4+ T cells increased in the whole cohort from a median of 214 cells/mm3 (IQR, 90-355) to 499 cells/mm3 (IQR, 312-733) (P<0.001). Compared with the group with a baseline CD4+ T-cell count of >or=500/mm3, the relative risk of having a last determination of CD4+ T-cell counts >200 cells/mm3 was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.75-0.83), 0.92 (95% CI, 0.89-0.96) and 1 for baseline CD4+ T cells <200 cells/mm3, 200-349 cells/mm3, and 350-499 cells/mm3, respectively. The relative risk of having a last determination of CD4+ T-cell counts >500 cells/mm3 was 0.32 (95% CI, 0.27-0.39, P<0.001), 0.69 (95% CI, 0.60-0.79, P<0.001), and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.83-1.06, P=0.38) for baseline CD4+ T-cell counts <200 cells/mm3, 200-349 cells/mm3, and 350-0499 cells/mm3, respectively, compared with a baseline CD4+ T-cell count of >or=500 cells/mm3. The increase in CD4+ T cells from baseline was statistically significant and was maintained for up to 4 years of follow-up. This increase seemed to slow down after approximately 3 years and reached a plateau after 4-5 years of follow-up even in patients who achieved and maintained viral suppression in plasma. Long-term immune recovery is possible regardless of baseline CD4+ T-cell count. However, patients who start therapy with a CD4+ T-cell count <200 cells/mm3 have poorer immunologic outcome as measured by the proportion of patients with CD4+ T cells <200/mm3 or >500/mm3 at last determination. It seems that the immune recovery slows down after approximately 3 years of HAART and reaches a plateau after 4-5 years of HAART.",

We sought to evaluate the predictive role of frailty in an observational cohort study of inpatients with decompensated cirrhosis between 2010 and 2013. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included discharge to a rehabilitation hospital, 30-day readmission, and length of stay. Frailty was assessed with three metrics: activities of daily living (ADL), the Braden Scale, and the Morse fall risk score. A predictive model was validated by randomly dividing the population into training and validation cohorts: 734 patients were admitted 1358 times in the study period. The overall 90-day mortality was 18.3%. The 30-day readmission rate was 26.6%, and the rate of discharge to a rehabilitation facility was 14.3%. Adjusting for sex, age, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, sodium, and Charlson index, the odds ratio for the effect of an ADL score of less than 12 of 15 on mortality is 1.83 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-3.20). A predictive model for 90-day mortality including ADL and Braden Scale yielded C statistics of 0.83 (95% CI 0.80-0.86) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.71-0.83) in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Discharge to a rehabilitation hospital is predicted by both the ADL (<12) and Braden Scale (<16), with respective adjusted odds ratios of 3.78 (95% CI 1.97-7.29) and 6.23 (95% CI 2.53-15.4).

However, for patients with compensated disease, data are limited regarding associations with poor patient-reported outcomes (PROs). We prospectively enrolled 300 patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension without a history of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and reviewed medical and pharmacy records. We characterized determinants of PROs using the 8-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-8) scale (0-100) and sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; poor sleep >5). Disability and frailty measures were assessed using activities of daily living (ADLs), falls, hand-grip, and chair-stands. Cognitive function was measured using weighted-lures from the Inhibitory Control Test (ICT). The median age of our cohort was 60 (interquartile range [IQR], 52-66) years, 56.3% were male, and 70% Child class A. All patients had portal hypertension, 76% had varices, and 41% had a history of ascites (predominantly well controlled). The median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease with Sodium (MELD-Na) score was 9 (IQR, 7-13). The overall median SF-8 was 70 (IQR, 54-86). Multivariate analysis showed that after adjusting for age, sex, education, and MELD-Na, performance on chair-stands (9.28 HRQOL points [95% confidence interval {CI}, 4.76-13.8] per 10-stands), ADL dependence (-6.06 [-10.8 to -1.36]), opiate use (-5.01 [-7.84 to -2.19]), benzodiazepine use (-3.50 [-6.58 to -0.42]), and ICT performance (-0.10 [-0.20 to 0.001] per weighted-lure) were significantly associated with HRQOL. Among patients completing the ICT, poor HRQOL (score <50) was significantly associated with chair-stands (odds ratio [OR] per 10-stands, 0.24; 95% CI [0.11-0.56]) and weighted lures (OR per weighted-lure, 1.01 [1.00-1.03]). Poor sleep quality was associated with opiate use (OR, 2.85 [1.11-7.29]) and lures (OR per-lure, 1.03 [1.00-1.05]).

        "# Title: Frailty Is a Risk Factor for Postoperative Mortality in Patients With Cirrhosis Undergoing Diverse Major Surgeries.\n# Abstract: With a rising burden of cirrhosis surgeries, understanding risk factors for postoperative mortality is more salient than ever. The role of baseline frailty has not been assessed in this context. We evaluated the association between patient frailty and postoperative risk among diverse patients with cirrhosis and determined if frailty improves prognostication of cirrhosis surgical risk scores. This was a retrospective cohort study of U.S. veterans with cirrhosis identified between 2008 and 2016 who underwent nontransplant major surgery. Frailty was ascertained using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS). Cox regression analysis was used to investigate the impact of patient frailty on postoperative mortality. Logistic regression was used to identify incremental changes in discrimination for postoperative mortality when frailty was added to the risk prediction models, including the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), MELD-sodium (MELD-Na), Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP), Mayo Risk Score (MRS), and Veterans Outcomes and Costs Associated With Liver Disease (VOCAL)-Penn. A total of 804 cirrhosis surgeries were identified. The majority of patients (48.5%) had high-risk frailty at baseline (HFRS >15). In adjusted Cox regression models, categories of increasing frailty scores were associated with poorer postoperative survival. For example, intermediate-risk frailty (HFRS 5-15) conferred a 1.77-fold increased hazard relative to low-risk frailty (HFRS, <5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-2.95; P = 0.03). High-risk frailty demonstrated a similarly increased hazard (hazard ratio, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.05-2.88; P = 0.03), suggesting a threshold effect of frailty on postoperative mortality. The incorporation of frailty improved discrimination of MELD, MELD-Na, and CTP for postoperative mortality, but did not do so for the MRS or VOCAL-Penn score. Patient frailty was an additional important predictor of cirrhosis surgical risk. The incorporation of preoperative frailty assessments may help to risk stratify patients, especially in settings where the MELD-Na and CTP are commonly applied.",

We examined the feasibility of inpatient frailty measurements and associations with nonhome discharge, readmission, and all-cause mortality among patients admitted for cirrhosis complications. We conducted a prospective study at 3 liver transplantation (LT) centers. Frailty was assessed using the liver frailty index (LFI). Multivariable logistic and competing risk models evaluated associations between frailty and clinical outcomes. We included 211 patients with median MELD-Na score 21 (interquartile range [IQR],15-27); 96 (45%) were women, and 102 (48%) were on the LT waiting list. At a median follow-up of 8.3 months, 29 patients (14%) were nonhome discharged, 144 (68%) were readmitted, 70 (33%) underwent LT, and 44 (21%) died. A total of 124 patients (59%) were frail, with a median LFI of 4.71 (IQR, 4.07-5.54). Frail patients were older (mean, 59 versus 54 years) and more likely to have chronic kidney disease (40% versus 20%; P = 0.002) and coronary artery disease (17% versus 7%; P = 0.03). Frailty was associated with hospital-acquired infections (8% versus 1%; P = 0.02). In multivariable models, LFI was associated with nonhome discharge (odds ratio, 1.81 per 1-point increase; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-2.86). Frailty (LFI≥4.5) was associated with all-cause mortality in models accounting for LT as competing risk (subhazard ratio [sHR], 2.4; 95% CI, 1.13-5.11); results were similar with LFI as a continuous variable (sHR, 1.62 per 1-point increase; 95% CI, 1.15-2.28). A brief, objective inpatient frailty assessment was feasible and predicted nonhome discharge and mortality in decompensated cirrhosis. Inpatient point-of-care frailty assessment prior to hospital discharge can be useful for risk stratification and targeted interventions to improve physical fitness and reduce adverse outcomes.",

        "# Title: Health-Related Quality of Life and Its Contributors According to a Preference-Based Generic Instrument in Cirrhosis.\n# Abstract: It is essential to determine contributors around impairment in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with cirrhosis aiming at improving health care and therapeutic strategy. Studies simultaneously incorporating disease severity based on biochemical parameters and other physical/psychological effects (i.e., sleep disturbance and frailty) are heterogeneous and the subject of the present study. We analyzed and compared HRQoL, using the EuroQol Group 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire and the utility index retrieved, in patients with cirrhosis and across groups stratified by sleep disturbance or frailty phenotype. Sleep disturbance and frailty were determined by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Frailty Index, respectively. Multiple linear regression was implemented to clarify contributors of poor HRQoL. In this cohort of 227 patients with mean age of 61.7 years and 47.2% male, more than half of the study population represented impairment in HRQoL in at least one domain, according to EQ-5D. Furthermore, sleep disturbance and frailty have proved to be independently associated with poor HRQoL in two separate regression models, whereas conventional scoring systems such as Child-Pugh classification and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease are not closely relevant. Intriguingly, not all health domains within EQ-5D correlated well with PSQI and Frailty Index, with the exception of usual activities. Pain and anxiety/depression were the most frequently affected HRQoL domains even in patients without sleep disturbance or frailty. Conclusion: Impaired HRQoL is prevalent in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Sleep disturbance and frailty are independently associated with poor HRQoL. It is imperative to timely intervene with these symptoms and deliver tailored health care.",

        "# Title: Liver Frailty Index for Prediction of Short-Term Rehospitalization in Patients with Liver Cirrhosis.\n# Abstract: Background: Stratifying patients with liver cirrhosis for risk of rehospitalization is challenging with established scoring systems for chronic liver disease. Frailty captures the physical characteristics of patients with cirrhosis. Its value for predicting short-term rehospitalizations in hospitalized patients remains to be defined. Methods: Eighty-three non-electively hospitalized patients with liver cirrhosis were analyzed in this study. Frailty was assessed during the last 48 h of hospital stay with the liver frailty index (LFI). Patients were followed for 30-day rehospitalization. Results: In total, 26 (31%) patients were rehospitalized within 30 days. The median LFI was 4.5, and 43 (52%) patients were identified as frail. Rehospitalized patients had a significant higher LFI compared to patients without a rehospitalization within 30 days. In multivariable analysis, LFI as a metric variable (OR 2.36, p = 0.02) and lower platelet count (OR 0.98, p < 0.01) were independently associated with rehospitalization. LFI and its subtest chair stands had the best discriminative ability to predict rehospitalization, with AUROCs of 0.66 and 0.67, respectively. An LFI cut-off of >4.62 discriminated best between patients with and without elevated risk for rehospitalization within 30 days. Conclusions: Measures of frailty could be useful to identify patients at higher risk for short-term rehospitalization.",

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a cross-sectional study involving individuals aged 32 to 69 years, all diagnosed with liver cirrhosis. The chronic liver disease questionnaire (CLDQ) was used to assess HR-QoL, the CLDQ score was used as an outcome to measure the factors related to HR-QoL, and the liver frailty index (LFI) was used to assess the frailty status. The association between the frailty status and the CLDQ summary scales was investigated using the correlation coefficient and multiple regression analyses. A total of 138 patients in the frail (n = 62) and non-frail (n = 76) groups with (alcohol: 97; viral: 24; autoimmune: 17; and cryptogenic: 12) were included in the study. Age, CTP score, and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) sodium were significantly higher in the frail group. In the CLDQ domains, there was a significant difference between the frail and non-frail groups (p value = 0.001). In health-related quality-of-life summary measures, there was a strong negative correlation between frailty and the scores for activities, emotional function, and fatigue (p value = 0.001). When comparing frail to non-frail patients, these characteristics demonstrated significantly increased odds as indicated by their adjusted odds ratios: OR 3.339 (p value = 0.013), OR 3.998 (p value = 0.006), and OR 4.626 (p value = 0.002), respectively."

        "# Title: Long-term CD4+ T-cell response to highly active antiretroviral therapy according to baseline CD4+ T-cell count.\n# Abstract: Current treatment guidelines for HIV infection recommend a relatively late initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Nevertheless, there is still a concern that immune recovery may not be as complete once CD4+ T cells have decreased below a certain threshold. This study addressed the long-term response of CD4+ T-cell counts in patients on HAART and analyzed the influence of baseline CD4+ T-cell counts, baseline viral load, and age. An observational analysis of evolution of CD4+ T cells in 861 antiretroviral therapy-naive chronic HIV-1-infected patients who started treatment consisting of at least 3 drugs in or after 1996 was performed. Patients were classified in 4 groups according to baseline CD4+ T cells: <200 cells/mm3, 200-349 cells/mm3, 350-499 cells/mm3, and >or=500 cells/mm3. The main outcome measures were proportion of patients with CD4+ T cells <200/mm3 and >500/mm3 at last determination and rate of CD4+ T-cell recovery. Patients were followed-up for a median of 173 weeks (interquartile range [IQR], 100-234). There were no differences in follow-up between the 4 groups. CD4+ T cells increased in the whole cohort from a median of 214 cells/mm3 (IQR, 90-355) to 499 cells/mm3 (IQR, 312-733) (P<0.001). Compared with the group with a baseline CD4+ T-cell count of >or=500/mm3, the relative risk of having a last determination of CD4+ T-cell counts >200 cells/mm3 was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.75-0.83), 0.92 (95% CI, 0.89-0.96) and 1 for baseline CD4+ T cells <200 cells/mm3, 200-349 cells/mm3, and 350-499 cells/mm3, respectively. The relative risk of having a last determination of CD4+ T-cell counts >500 cells/mm3 was 0.32 (95% CI, 0.27-0.39, P<0.001), 0.69 (95% CI, 0.60-0.79, P<0.001), and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.83-1.06, P=0.38) for baseline CD4+ T-cell counts <200 cells/mm3, 200-349 cells/mm3, and 350-0499 cells/mm3, respectively, compared with a baseline CD4+ T-cell count of >or=500 cells/mm3. The increase in CD4+ T cells from baseline was statistically significant and was maintained for up to 4 years of follow-up. This increase seemed to slow down after approximately 3 years and reached a plateau after 4-5 years of follow-up even in patients who achieved and maintained viral suppression in plasma. Long-term immune recovery is possible regardless of baseline CD4+ T-cell count. However, patients who start therapy with a CD4+ T-cell count <200 cells/mm3 have poorer immunologic outcome as measured by the proportion of patients with CD4+ T cells <200/mm3 or >500/mm3 at last determination. It seems that the immune recovery slows down after approximately 3 years of HAART and reaches a plateau after 4-5 years of HAART.",

Positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]FDDNP and the determination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of these proteins constitute a means to visualize in vivo Aβ and tau brain accumulation. Information about longitudinal changes of these CSF and PET biomarkers in PD with regard to progression to dementia is lacking. We assessed the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of CSF and PET biomarkers of tau and Aβ with PD-related cognitive dysfunction in 6 healthy-controls (HC), 16 patients with PD without dementia (PDND), and 8 PD with dementia (PDD). All subjects underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing, [18F]FDDNP PET, and CSF Aβ-tau determination. After 18 months, the PDND group was re-assessed clinically and by neuropsychological, PET, and CSF determinations. Cross-sectionally, PDD had higher [18F]FDDNP binding in lateral temporal regions and lower levels of CSF Aβ levels compared to PDND, with a congruent correlation between the [18F]FDDNP binding and CSF Aβ levels. Longitudinally, higher baseline lateral temporal [18F]FDDNP binding was associated to longitudinal worsening in cognitive performances and progression to dementia among subjects classified as PDND at baseline, who additionally disclosed at follow-up an increase in lateral-temporal FDDNP binding, as well as a reduction in CSF Aβ and an increase in CSF tau levels.

While many parkinsonian disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia, and multiple system atrophy are classified as synucleinopathies, progressive supranuclear palsy is coined a tauopathy due to the aggregation of pathological tau in the brain. [18F]AV-1451 (also known as [18F]-T807) is a positron emission tomography radiotracer that binds to paired helical filaments of tau in Alzheimer's disease. We investigated whether [18F]AV-1451 could be used as biomarker for the diagnosis and disease progression monitoring in progressive supranuclear palsy. Six progressive supranuclear palsy, six Parkinson's disease, and 10 age-matched healthy controls were recruited. An anatomical MRI and a 90-min PET scan, using [18F]AV-1451, were acquired from all participants. The standardized uptake value ratio from 60 to 90 min post-injection was calculated in each region of interest, using the cerebellar cortex as a reference region. No significant differences in standardized uptake value ratios were detected in our progressive supranuclear palsy group compared to the two control groups.

[18F]AV-1451 is a positron emission tomography radiotracer designed to bind pathological tau. A post-mortem study using [18F]AV-1451 discovered off-target binding properties to neuromelanin in the substantia nigra. A subsequent clinical study reported a 30% decrease in [18F]AV-1451 binding in the midbrain of PD patients. A total of 12 patients and 10 healthy age-matched controls were recruited. An anatomical MRI and a 90-min PET scan, using [18F]AV-1451, were acquired from all participants. The standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) from 60 to 90 min post-injection was calculated for the substantia nigra, using the cerebellar cortex as the reference region. The substantia nigra was delineated using automated region of interest software. An independent samples ANOVA and LSD post hoc testing were used to test for differences in [18F]AV-1451 SUVR between groups. Substantia nigra SUVR from 60 to 90 min was significantly greater in HC compared to both PSP and PD groups. Although the PD group had the lowest SUVR, there was no significant difference in substantia nigra uptake between PD and PSP. [18F]AV-1451 may be the first PET radiotracer capable of imaging neurodegeneration of the substantia nigra in parkinsonisms.

We therefore wanted to study the retention patterns of 18F-AV-1451 in PD, PD-dementia (PDD), and DLB. To do this 44 healthy controls, 11 non-demented patients with PD, 18 patients with PDD, and six patients with DLB underwent MRI and 18F-AV-1451 PET scanning and cognitive testing. We found that parietal 18F-AV-1451 retention was increased in patients with DLB compared to controls and PD patients, while 18F-AV-1451 uptake was reduced in the substantia nigra in PDD. Increased parietal 18F-AV-1451 PET uptake was associated with impaired performance on verbal fluency tests, and the decreased uptake in the substantia nigra correlated with worse motor function. We found no effect of the monoamine oxidase B inhibitor rasagiline on 18F-AV-1451 binding. In conclusion DLB patients have increased parietal 18F-AV-1451 uptake. Increased parietal tau is associated with executive impairment in patients with synucleinopathies, while decreased uptake in the substantia nigra is associated with parkinsonism. Further, our data indicate that 18F-AV-1451 does not significantly bind to MAO-B in vivo.",

        "# Title: PET Imaging of Astrogliosis and Tau Facilitates Diagnosis of Parkinsonian Syndromes.\n# Abstract: Neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes comprise a number of disorders that are characterized by similar clinical features but are separated on the basis of different pathologies, i.e., aggregates of α-synuclein or tau protein. Due to the overlap of signs and symptoms a precise differentiation is often difficult, especially early in the disease course. Enormous efforts have been taken to develop tau-selective PET imaging agents, but strong off-target binding to monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) has been observed across first generation ligands. Nonetheless, astrogliosis-related MAO-B elevation is a common histopathological known feature of all parkinsonian syndromes and might be itself an interesting imaging target. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the performance of [18F]-THK5351, a combined MAO-B and tau tracer for differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes. [18F]-THK5351 PET was performed in 34 patients: six with Parkinson's disease (PD), nine with multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P), six with MSA with predominant cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C), and 13 with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) Richardson's syndrome. Volume-of-interest-based quantification of standardized-uptake-values was conducted in different parkinsonian syndrome-related target regions. PET results were subjected to multinomial logistic regression to create a prediction model discriminating among groups. Furthermore, we correlated tracer uptake with clinical findings. Elevated [18F]-THK5351 uptake in midbrain and diencephalon differentiated PSP patients from PD and MSA-C. MSA-C patients were distinguishable by high tracer uptake in the pons and cerebellar deep white matter when compared to PSP and PD patients, whereas MSA-P patients tended to show higher tracer uptake in the lentiform nucleus. A multinomial logistic regression classified 33/34 patients into the correct clinical diagnosis group. Tracer uptake in the pons, cerebellar deep white matter, and striatum was closely associated with the presence of cerebellar and parkinsonian symptoms of MSA patients. The current study demonstrates that combined MAO-B and tau binding of THK5351 facilitates differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes. Furthermore, our data indicate a correlation of MSA phenotype with [18F]-THK5351 uptake in certain brain regions, illustrating their relevance for the emergence of clinical symptoms and underlining the potential of THK5351 PET as a biomarker that correlates with pathological changes as well as with disease stage.",

Results: The global cortical standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) of 18F-T807 PET was comparable between PD and control (p = 0.088). The cortical SUVR was significantly higher in AD group (p = 0.002) but was modestly increased in PSP group compared to the PD group (p = 0.044), especially in parietal and pallidal regions. Asymmetric 18F-T807 uptake at the pallidum was noted in patients with CBS and FTD. Cortical tau tracer uptake was associated with increased plasma total tau level (p = 0.016), especially in frontal and parietal regions. Regional tracer uptake was correlated with cortical thinning in patients with CBS and PSP (CBS: r = -0.092, p = 0.025; PSP: r = -0.114, p = 0.015). Conclusions: The 18F-T807 tau tracer uptake was only modestly increased in patients with PSP. Although the cortical tau tracer uptake correlated with regional cortical atrophy and plasma tau levels, a four-repeated tau-specific tracer is needed for future classifying tauopathy parkinsonism syndromes.",

The true incidence of post stroke shoulder pain has not been fully evaluated. In order to establish this, we undertook a prospective study of 123 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of acute stroke during a 6-month period. Patients were assessed by interview, full rheumatological and neurological examination, 14 days post stroke, for a history of shoulder pain according to predetermined criteria. In addition, Barthel Index, HAD score and pain scores were also recorded. Twenty-five percent of patients developed shoulder pain within 2 weeks of their stroke. There was a statistically significant association with ipsilateral sensory impairment (p < 0.005), abnormal rheumatological examination (p < 0.001) and depression score (p < 0.005). We conclude that post stroke shoulder pain is more common than previously realized and in addition to abnormal shoulder joint examination may also be associated with upper limb sensory impairment. Thorough neurological examination is required to detect sensory loss and hence establish patients at risk. This is probably best done by a structured proforma.",

Here, we present data from a retrospective analysis using PET/CT and PET/MRI examinations to investigate the efficacy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET for primary N-staging of patients with prostate cancer (PC) compared with morphologic imaging (CT or MRI) and validated by histopathology. Methods: Data from 58 patients with high-risk PC (according to the D'Amico criteria) who were staged with 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET/CT or PET/MRI at our institution between July 2017 and June 2018 were reviewed. The patients had a median prescan prostate-specific antigen value of 12.2 ng/mL (range, 1.2-81.6 ng/mL). The median injected activity of 18F-rhPSMA-7 was 327 MBq (range, 132-410 MBq), with a median uptake time of 79.5 min (range, 60-153 min). All patients underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection. The presence of lymph node metastases was determined by an experienced reader independently for both the PET and the morphologic datasets using a template-based analysis on a 5-point scale. Patient-level and template-based results were both compared with histopathologic findings. Results: Lymph node metastases were present in 18 patients (31.0%) and were located in 52 of 375 templates (13.9%). Receiver-operating-characteristic analyses showed 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET to perform significantly better than morphologic imaging on both patient-based and template-based analyses (areas under curve, 0.858 vs. 0.649 [P = 0.012] and 0.765 vs. 0.589 [P < 0.001], respectively). On patient-based analyses, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET were 72.2%, 92.5%, and 86.2%, respectively, and those of morphologic imaging were 50.0%, 72.5%, and 65.5%, respectively. On template-based analyses, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET were 53.8%, 96.9%, and 90.9%, respectively, and those of morphologic imaging were 9.6%, 95.0%, and 83.2%, respectively. Conclusion:18F-rhPSMA-7 PET is superior to morphologic imaging for N-staging of high-risk primary PC. The efficacy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 is similar to published data for 68Ga-PSMA-11.",

On the basis of clinical results, 18F-PSMA-1007 is a promising PSMA PET tracer, but detailed histologic confirmation has been lacking. Methods: Ninety-six patients with prostate cancer underwent 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT followed by either radical prostatectomy with lymphadenectomy or salvage lymphadenectomy. The histologic findings of PSMA PET-positive nodes were analyzed retrospectively. A lesion-based and patient-based analysis was performed comparing all positive lesions and only lesions larger than 3 mm on histopathology. Results: Of the patients, 90.6% received 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT for staging before the primary treatment, whereas 9.4% underwent imaging for biochemical recurrence. In 34.4% of the cohort, positive lymph nodes were present on imaging. In total, 1,746 lymph nodes were dissected in 96 patients. 18F-PSMA-1007 PET had a lesion-based sensitivity of 81.7%, a specificity of 99.6%, a positive predictive value of 92.4%, and a negative predictive value of 98.9% for detecting positive lymph nodes larger than 3 mm. In the analysis of all malignant nodes regardless of size, the overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value on lesion-based analysis were 71.2%, 99.5%, 91.3%, and 97.9%, respectively. The patient-based analysis showed a sensitivity of 85.9% and a specificity of 99.5% for lymph nodes larger than 3 mm.

Loss of LKB1 promotes cancer progression and influences therapeutic responses in preclinical studies; however, specific targeted therapies for lung cancer with LKB1 inactivation are currently unavailable. Here, we have identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) signature that is associated with the loss of LKB1 function. We discovered that LINC00473 is consistently the most highly induced gene in LKB1-inactivated human primary NSCLC samples and derived cell lines. Elevated LINC00473 expression correlated with poor prognosis, and sustained LINC00473 expression was required for the growth and survival of LKB1-inactivated NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, LINC00473 was induced by LKB1 inactivation and subsequent cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)/CREB-regulated transcription coactivator (CRTC) activation. We determined that LINC00473 is a nuclear lncRNA and interacts with NONO, a component of the cAMP signaling pathway, thereby facilitating CRTC/CREB-mediated transcription. Collectively, our study demonstrates that LINC00473 expression potentially serves as a robust biomarker for tumor LKB1 functional status that can be integrated into clinical trials for patient selection and treatment evaluation, and implicates LINC00473 as a therapeutic target for LKB1-inactivated NSCLC.",

However, neither the expression pattern nor the biological functions of LINC00473 have been elucidated in cervical cancer so far. In the present study, gain- and loss-of-function assays showed that LINC00473 promoted cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis in cervical cancer cells in vitro. Moreover, we found that LINC00473 enhanced the growth of cervical cancer cells in vivo. Mechanistic investigation showed that LINC00473 directly interacted with ILF2 and suppressed its degradation. Finally, we demonstrated that miR-34a reduced the stability of LINC00473. These findings may have important implications for developing novel therapeutic strategies for cervical cancer.",

Recent studies reported that lncRNA LINC00473 (LNC473) was involved in cancer progression. However, the clinical significance and functional role of LNC473 in HCC progression is still unknown. In the present study, we found that the LNC473 expression was markedly elevated in HCC tissues and correlated with bigger tumor size, higher BCLC stage, vascular invasion and poor prognosis. Gain- and loss-of-function assay showed that LNC473 enhanced HCC cell proliferation and invasion and induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Mechanistically, LNC473 associated with oncoprotein survivin and regulates its stability. Moreover, LNC473 could recruit deubiquitinase USP9X to inhibit the ubiquitination level of survivin and then increase survivin expression. Therefore, our results suggest that LNC473 exerts its functions as an oncogene in HCC progression and may be a therapeutic target for HCC treatment.",

However, the clinical value and biological function of LINC00473 in gastric cancer (GC) was still unknown. In our results, LINC00473 expression was increased in GC tissue samples and GC cell lines compared with paired adjacent normal stomach tissue samples and normal gastric epithelial cell line, respectively. High-expression of LINC00473 was correlated with poor histological type, advanced clinical stage, more lymph node metastasis and present distant metastasis. The results of Kaplan-Meier analysis and TCGA database similarly suggested that GC patients with LINC00473 high-expression had poorer prognosis than GC patients with LINC00473 low-expression. Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that LINC00473 high-expression served as independent unfavorable prognostic factor for overall survival in GC patients. The study in vitro indicated that silencing of LINC00473 had no effect on GC cell viability, but inhibited GC cell migration and invasion through modulating MMP2 and MMP9 expression. In conclusion, LINC00473 is associated with the malignant status and prognosis in GC cases, and functions as an oncogenic lncRNA to regulate GC cell migration and invasion.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of LINC00473 and underlying mechanisms in BC. Expression pattern of LINC00473 was analyzed using qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) assays in BC tissues and cells. Overexpression or knockdown of LINC00473 in vitro and functional experiments were performed to study its effects on BC cells. Target prediction, luciferase assays, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and RNA immunoprecipitation were used to verify the role of LINC00473 as a competing endogenous RNA. The impact of LINC00473 on tumor growth was also evaluated using a xenograft model. In our study, we found that LINC00473 was highly expressed in BC tissues and cells, and the elevated expression was correlated with shorter overall survival in patients with BC. Furthermore, knockdown of LINC00473 significantly inhibited the capacity of proliferation, invasion and migration of BC cells. Animal experiment suggested that silencing LINC00473 could significantly inhibit the tumor growth. Following experiments revealed that LINC00473 may function as a competing endogenous RNA to regulate the expression of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1 (MAPK1) through competition for miR-198. Thus, increased expression of LINC00473 in breast cancer tissues is linked to poor prognosis. LINC00473 may function as an endogenous completive RNA by sponging miR-198 to regulate MAPK1 expression. Findings of our study contributed to the basis for further exploring the application of LINC00473 as a prognostic and diagnostic biomarker.",

Long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00473 has been reported as potentially critical regulators in various types of cancer tumorigenesis. However, the effects of LINC00473 on glioma cells is unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the clinical significance, effects and mechanism of LINC00437 on glioma tumorigenesis. In the present study, LINC00473 was significantly increased in glioma tissues and in cell models, and predicted a poor prognosis in patients with glioma. Notably, LINC00473 knockdown not only suppressed cell proliferation, invasion and migration of glioma cells, but also blocked cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis. Subcutaneous xenotransplanted tumor model experiments revealed that reduced LINC00473 expression was able to suppress in vivo glioma growth. Mechanistically, LINC00473 functioned as a competing endogenous (ce)RNA to decrease microRNA (miR)‑195‑5p expression. Moreover, Yes‑associated protein 1 (YAP1) and TEA domain family member 1 (TEAD1) were identified as downstream targets of miR‑195‑5p, whose expression levels were inhibited by miR‑195‑5p. LINC00473 knockdown suppressed glioma progression through the decrease of miR‑195‑5p and subsequent increase of YAP1 and TEAD1 expression levels. These results indicated LINC00473 might act as a ceRNA to sponge miR‑195‑5p, thus promoting YAP1 and TEAD1 expressions, and shedding light on the underlying mechanisms of LINC00473‑induced glioma progression.",

Nevertheless, the mechanisms through which LINC00473 regulates the radiosensitivity of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells remains elusive. In the present study, reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR was used to quantify the expression of LINC00473, microRNA (miRNA/miR)‑497‑5p and cell division cycle 25A (CDC25A) in ESCC tissues. The association between LINC00473 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with ESCC was also assessed. Furthermore, Cell Counting kit‑8 and colony formation assays were carried out to monitor the proliferation of ESCC cells exposed to X‑ray radiation. A dual‑luciferase reporter assay was also conducted to analyze the interaction between LINC00473 and miR‑497‑5p, as well as the interaction between CDC25A and miR‑497‑5p. The findings of the present study demonstrated that in ESCC tissues and cells, the expression levels of LINC00473 and CDC25A were significantly upregulated, while the expression of miR‑497‑5p was downregulated. The high expression level of LINC00473 was associated with a higher T stage, lymph node metastasis stage and a lower tumor differentiation grade in patients with ESCC. Following irradiation, transfection with miR‑497‑5p mimics reduced the promoting effect of LINC00473 overexpression on ESCC cell proliferation, and partially impeded the resistance of ESCC cells to X‑ray radiation induced by LINC00473 overexpression. Moreover, transfection with miR‑497‑5p inhibitors partially alleviated the inhibitory effects of LINC00473 knockdown on cellular proliferation, and partly reversed the sensitivity of cells to X‑ray irradiation induced by LINC00473 knockdown. Furthermore, it was confirmed that miR‑497‑5p was able to bind LINC00473 and the 3'‑untranslated region of CDC25A. On the whole, the findings of the present study demonstrate that LINC00473 reduces the radiosensitivity of ESCC cells by modulating the miR‑497‑5p/CDC25A axis.",

        "# Title: LNC473 Regulating APAF1 IRES-Dependent Translation via Competitive Sponging miR574 and miR15b: Implications in Colorectal Cancer.\n# Abstract: A growing number of studies have focused on the involvement of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in the internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated translation in tumorigenesis; however, the underlying mechanisms in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain elusive. In this study, we show that LINC00473 (LNC473) exerted its functions as a tumor suppressor in promoting apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF1) IRES activity through competitively sponging miR574-5p and miR15b-5p in CRC initiation and pathogenesis. Specifically, LNC473 and its downstream target APAF1 were significantly downregulated accompanied by upregulated miR574-5p and miR15b-5p in CRC cells and tissues, which had a significant prognostic impact on clinical outcomes in our CRC cohort (n = 157). Furthermore, ectopic LNC473 significantly sponged endogenous miR574-5p or miR15b-5p and thereby inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation capacity, and it accelerated cell apoptosis through activating the APAF1-CASP9-CASP3 pathway. Notably, LNC473 overexpression resulted in dramatic promotion of APAF1 IRES activity and translation, whereas rescue experiments confirmed the recovery by the existence of LNC473 and miR574/15b-5p. Mechanistically, LNC473 overexpression promoted IRES binding domain exposure and removed the constraints controlling from miR574-5p and miR15b-5p, and subsequently enhanced IRES-mediated APAF1 expression in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, our results uncover a novel LNC473-miR574/miR15b-APAF1 signaling axis, which provides new targets and crosstalk regulation mechanism for CRC prevention and treatment.",
        "# Title: Knockdown of LINC00473 promotes radiosensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer cells via sponging miR-513a-3p.\n# Abstract: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung cancer. Radioresistance is a significant obstacle in NSCLC radiotherapy. Long non-coding RNA LINC00473 has been found to impact the radiotherapy in several malignant tumours. This study aimed to investigate the underlying role and mechanism of LINC00473 in regulating radiosensitivity of NSCLC cells. The levels of LINC00473 and miR-513a-3p were measured by quantitative Real-Time PCR. The relationship of LINC00473 with overall survival was tested by the Kaplan-Meier method. The effects of LINC00473 on cell viability and cell survival were assessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony survival assay in NSCLC cells exposed to different doses of radiation. A luciferase reporter assay was used to investigate the correlation between LINC00473 and miR-513a-3p. The present study showed that the relative LINC00473 expression was upregulated and miR-513a-3p expression was downregulated in radioresistant NSCLC patients compared with radiosensitive patients. And upregulated LINC00473 expression was associated with poor prognosis of NSCLC patients after radiotherapy. Radiation led to an increase in LINC00473 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The knockdown of LINC00473 markedly promoted radiosensitivity in NSCLC cells under different doses of radiation. LINC00473 was a sponge of miR-513a-3p and negatively regulated the miR-513a-3p expression. In conclusion, the inhibition of miR-513a-3p markedly reversed the promoted effect of LINC00473 knockdown on cell radiosensitivity. LINC00473 inhibition enhances radiosensitivity of NSCLC by sponging miR-513a-3p, providing a promising therapeutic target to increase the sensitivity of radiotherapy in NSCLC patients.",
        "# Title: lncRNA LINC00473 promotes proliferation, migration, invasion and inhibition of apoptosis of non-small cell lung cancer cells by acting as a sponge of miR-497-5p.\n# Abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-associated death worldwide and exhibits a poor prognosis. The present study aimed to determine the effect of long non-coding (lnc)RNA-LINC00473 on the development of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells by regulating the expression of microRNA (miR)-497-5p. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was conducted to detect the level of LINC00473 and miR-497-5p. An MTT assay, flow cytometry and Transwell tests were performed to evaluate the proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells. Western blotting was performed to detect the expression of apoptosis- and migration-related proteins. RNA immunoprecipitation and a luciferase reporter assay were performed to verify the regulatory relationship between lncRNA-LINC00473 and miR-497-5p. LINC00473 expression was upregulated in lung cancer tissues and NSCLC cells (A549 and H1299) when compared with adjacent tissues or human bronchial epithelial cell lines and the 5-year survival rate was lower in patients with high LINC00473 expression compared with in patients with low LINC00473 expression. A negative correlation between LINC00473 and miR-497-5p was observed in lung cancer tissues. Proliferation, migration and invasion as well as the related protein levels were increased in A549 and H1299 transfected with pcDNA3.1-LINC00473, while the opposite results were obtained in A549 and H1299 transfected with small interfering (si)-LINC00473. Notably, it was demonstrated that LINC00473 could bind directly with miR-497-5p and inhibit its expression. miR-497-5p inhibitors reversed the effect of si-LINC00473. Furthermore, the present study demonstrated that LINC00473 promoted the malignant behaviour of NSCLC cells via regulating the ERK/p38 and MAPK signalling pathways and the expression of miR-497-5p.",
        "# Title: Long intergenic non-coding RNA 00473 promotes proliferation and migration of gastric cancer via the miR-16-5p/CCND2 axis and by regulating AQP3.\n# Abstract: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, but its molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Increasing evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) play a pivotal role in various cancers recently. Our present study focused on exploring the function of long intergenic non-coding RNA 00473 (LINC00473) in GC. In this study, we found that LINC00473 expression was aberrantly increased in tumor tissues compared with the paired para-cancerous tissues. The expression of high LINC00473 in GC was notably correlated with a higher risk of lymphatic metastasis, a higher incidence of vascular cancer embolus, and advanced TNM stage. Further experiments showed that the overexpression of LINC00473 could promote the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells both in vitro and in vivo. The apoptosis of GC cells increased significantly by the decrease of LINC00473. Mechanistically, LINC00473 could sponge miR-16-5p in the cytoplasm and relieve its suppression of CCND2. Moreover, AQP3 was found to be a significant downstream target gene for LINC00473 through RNA transcriptome sequencing, as demonstrated by qRT-PCR and western blot. Overexpression of LINC00473 can partially reverse the effects of AQP3 decrease on GC proliferation and metastasis. LINC00473 regulated AQP3 expression through CREB was confirmed by western blot. Our research indicates that LINC00473/miR-16-5p/CCND2 axis plays a role in the proliferation of GC and modulates AQP3 to influence GC cell metastasis, making it a potential therapeutic target for GC."

        "# Title: Long-term CD4+ T-cell response to highly active antiretroviral therapy according to baseline CD4+ T-cell count.\n# Abstract: Current treatment guidelines for HIV infection recommend a relatively late initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Nevertheless, there is still a concern that immune recovery may not be as complete once CD4+ T cells have decreased below a certain threshold. This study addressed the long-term response of CD4+ T-cell counts in patients on HAART and analyzed the influence of baseline CD4+ T-cell counts, baseline viral load, and age. An observational analysis of evolution of CD4+ T cells in 861 antiretroviral therapy-naive chronic HIV-1-infected patients who started treatment consisting of at least 3 drugs in or after 1996 was performed. Patients were classified in 4 groups according to baseline CD4+ T cells: <200 cells/mm3, 200-349 cells/mm3, 350-499 cells/mm3, and >or=500 cells/mm3. The main outcome measures were proportion of patients with CD4+ T cells <200/mm3 and >500/mm3 at last determination and rate of CD4+ T-cell recovery. Patients were followed-up for a median of 173 weeks (interquartile range [IQR], 100-234). There were no differences in follow-up between the 4 groups. CD4+ T cells increased in the whole cohort from a median of 214 cells/mm3 (IQR, 90-355) to 499 cells/mm3 (IQR, 312-733) (P<0.001). Compared with the group with a baseline CD4+ T-cell count of >or=500/mm3, the relative risk of having a last determination of CD4+ T-cell counts >200 cells/mm3 was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.75-0.83), 0.92 (95% CI, 0.89-0.96) and 1 for baseline CD4+ T cells <200 cells/mm3, 200-349 cells/mm3, and 350-499 cells/mm3, respectively. The relative risk of having a last determination of CD4+ T-cell counts >500 cells/mm3 was 0.32 (95% CI, 0.27-0.39, P<0.001), 0.69 (95% CI, 0.60-0.79, P<0.001), and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.83-1.06, P=0.38) for baseline CD4+ T-cell counts <200 cells/mm3, 200-349 cells/mm3, and 350-0499 cells/mm3, respectively, compared with a baseline CD4+ T-cell count of >or=500 cells/mm3. The increase in CD4+ T cells from baseline was statistically significant and was maintained for up to 4 years of follow-up. This increase seemed to slow down after approximately 3 years and reached a plateau after 4-5 years of follow-up even in patients who achieved and maintained viral suppression in plasma. Long-term immune recovery is possible regardless of baseline CD4+ T-cell count. However, patients who start therapy with a CD4+ T-cell count <200 cells/mm3 have poorer immunologic outcome as measured by the proportion of patients with CD4+ T cells <200/mm3 or >500/mm3 at last determination. It seems that the immune recovery slows down after approximately 3 years of HAART and reaches a plateau after 4-5 years of HAART.",

In 1632 donors, kidney discard risk increased for AKI stages 1, 2 and 3 (compared to no AKI) with adjusted relative risks of 1.28 (1.08-1.52), 1.82 (1.45-2.30) and 2.74 (2.0-3.75), respectively.

Six-month eGFR, however, was similar across AKI categories but was lower for recipients with DGF (48 [interquartile range: 31-61] vs. 58 [45-75] ml/min/1.73m(2) for no DGF, p < 0.001).

To determine whether this policy is justified, we analyzed outcomes of donor kidneys with acute kidney injury (AKI) in a large UK cohort. A retrospective analysis of the UK Transplant Registry evaluated deceased donors between 2003 and 2013. Donors were classified as no AKI, or AKI stage 1-3 according to Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Relationship of AKI with delayed graft function/primary nonfunction (DGF/PNF), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and graft-survival at 90 days and 1 year was analyzed. There were 11 219 kidneys (1869 [17%] with AKI) included. Graft failure at 1 year is greater for donors with AKI than for those without (graft survival 89% vs. 91%, p = 0.02; odds ratio (OR) 1.20 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.41]). DGF rates increase with donor AKI stage (p < 0.005), and PNF rates are significantly higher for AKIN stage 3 kidneys (9% vs. 4%, p = 0.04) Analysis of association between AKI and recipient eGFR suggests a risk of inferior eGFR with AKI versus no AKI (p < 0.005; OR 1.25 [95% CI: 1.08-1.31]). We report a small reduction in 1-year graft-survival of kidneys from donors with AKI. We conclude that AKI stage 1 or 2 kidneys should be used; however, caution is advised for AKI stage 3 donors.",

We aimed to evaluate the impact of donors' AKI severity and trend on graft outcomes in DDK transplantation. This was a retrospective study of DDK transplantation performed from 2005 to 2014. Based on maximum and terminal serum creatinine values before transplantation, the AKI trends were categorized as improving or worsening. Of 413 DDKs, 275 developed AKI: 177 stage 1, 52 stage 2, and 46 stage 3. DDKs with AKI had 212 improving AKI and 63 worsening AKI. Graft outcomes were similar based on AKI stage. Worsening AKI did not affect delayed graft function development; however, it significantly elevated graft failure risk even after adjusting for AKI stage and Kidney Donor Risk Index. Graft survival of the improving group was similar to DDKs with no AKI. This study showed that AKI severity of DDKs did not affect overall graft outcomes. Notably, DDKs with improving AKI showed a similar graft survival rate to DDKs without AKI, although worsening AKI had a worse prognosis. Consideration of the AKI trend, rather than its severity, is needed when DDKs with AKI are allocated.",
        "# Title: Deceased-donor acute kidney injury is not associated with kidney allograft failure.\n# Abstract: Deceased-donor acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with organ discard and delayed graft function, but data on longer-term allograft survival are limited. We performed a multicenter study to determine associations between donor AKI (from none to severe based on AKI Network stages) and all-cause graft failure, adjusting for donor, transplant, and recipient factors. We examined whether any of the following factors modified the relationship between donor AKI and graft survival: kidney donor profile index, cold ischemia time, donation after cardiac death, expanded-criteria donation, kidney machine perfusion, donor-recipient gender combinations, or delayed graft function. We also evaluated the association between donor AKI and a 3-year composite outcome of all-cause graft failure or estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 in a subcohort of 30% of recipients. Among 2,430 kidneys transplanted from 1,298 deceased donors, 585 (24%) were from donors with AKI. Over a median follow-up of 4.0 years, there were no significant differences in graft survival by donor AKI stage. We found no evidence that pre-specified variables modified the effect of donor AKI on graft survival. In the subcohort, donor AKI was not associated with the 3-year composite outcome. Donor AKI was not associated with graft failure in this well-phenotyped cohort. Given the organ shortage, the transplant community should consider measures to increase utilization of kidneys from deceased donors with AKI.",
        "# Title: Success of kidney transplantations from deceased donors with acute kidney injury.\n# Abstract: BACKGROUND The acceptance of organs from deceased donors with acute kidney injury (AKI) varies considerably, with uncertain outcomes. The current organ shortage has led to increased use of marginal donor organs. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective, single-center study included 642 patients who underwent kidney allograft transplantation between 2005 and 2016. The recipients were categorized into 3 groups: AKI-1 (n=214), comprising donors with a peak serum creatinine (SCr) level of 1.1-2.0 mg/dl; AKI-2 (n=89), comprising donors with a peak SCr level >2 mg/dl; and non-AKI (n=339), comprising donors with normal kidney function (SCr <1.1 mg/dl). RESULTS The cumulative survival rates for patients and grafts did not significantly differ among the AKI-1, AKI-2, and non-AKI groups at the 1-year (91.6%/79.4%, 92.1%/83.1%, 95.3%/88.5%, respectively) and 5-year assessments (79.4%/67.8%, 86.8%/71.7%, 80.5%/71.1%, respectively). These findings were corroborated by mean SCr values and estimated glomerular filtration rates at the 1-year (2.08±1.7/51.16±23.45, 2.01±1.52/56.46±23.63, 1.81±1.13/55.44±23.26 mg/dl, respectively) and 5-year assessments (1.91±1.28/51.06±24.65, 1.74±0.66/57.44±31.21, 1.7±0.88/58.56±26.04 mg/dl, respectively). The incidence of delayed graft function in each group was 29.9%, 44.9%, and 28.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Kidney transplantation from donors with AKI, although associated with a higher rate of delayed graft function, results in good long-term transplant survival and reliable kidney functionality after 5 years. The inclusion of donors with AKI may widely extend the pool of available organs; however, careful donor selection is necessary.",

We investigated the effect of donor AKI on renal function and chronic changes on protocol biopsies at 1-year post-transplant. Donor AKI was defined according to Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Between 2013 and 2017, 333 kidneys were transplanted and subsequently biopsied after 1 year. Fifty-three kidneys from AKI donors (AKIN stage I n = 42, stage II n = 8, stage III n = 3) were compared to 280 kidneys from non-AKI donors. At 1-year follow-up, patient and graft survival were comparable. Donor AKI was not predictive of IFTA (Banff interstitial fibrosis plus tubular atrophy scores) at 1-year post-transplant biopsy (2.10 ± 1.28 in AKI, 2.09 ± 1.22 in non-AKI, P = .95). Donor AKI was also not associated with progression of IFTA from 3 to 12 months (P = .69), or inferior glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, P = .94). In a multivariate analysis, the odds of IFTA >2 were comparable between AKI and non-AKI groups. In conclusion, the transplantation of kidneys from donors with predominantly stage I AKI results in comparable function and degree of fibrosis on protocol biopsies 1-year post-transplant. Selected grafts from donors with AKI are a valuable tool for expanding the donor pool for kidney transplantation.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate how kidney transplantation (KT) from a donor with AKI affects long-term graft survival in various situations. All patients who underwent KT from DBD donors between June 2003 and April 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. The KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) criteria were used to classify donor AKI. The cohort included 376 donors (no AKI group, n = 117 [31.1%]; AKI group n = 259 [68.9%]). Death-censored graft survival was similar according to the presence of AKI, AKI severity, and the AKI trend (p = 0.929, p = 0.077, and p = 0.658, respectively). Patients whose donors had AKI who received using low dose (1.5 mg/kg for three days) rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (r-ATG) as the induction agent had significantly superior death-censored graft survival compared with patients in that group who received basiliximab (p = 0.039).

        "# Title: Outcomes and factors leading to graft failure in kidney transplants from deceased donors with acute kidney injury-A retrospective cohort study.\n# Abstract: Due to shortage of donor, kidney transplants (KTs) from donors with acute kidney injury (AKI) are expanding. Although previous studies comparing clinical outcomes between AKI and non-AKI donors in KTs have shown comparable results, data on high-volume analysis of KTs outcomes with AKI donors are limited. This study aimed to analyze the selection trends of AKI donors and investigate the impact of AKI on graft failure using the United states cohort data. We analyzed a total 52,757 KTs collected in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipient (SRTR) from 2010 to 2015. The sample included 4,962 (9.4%) cases of KTs with AKI donors (creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dL). Clinical characteristics of AKI and non-AKI donors were analyzed and outcomes of both groups were compared. We also analyzed risk factors for graft failure in AKI donor KTs. Although the incidence of delayed graft function was higher in recipients of AKI donors compared to non-AKI donors, graft and patient survival were not significantly different between the two groups. We found donor hypertension, cold ischemic time, the proportion of African American donors, and high KDPI were risk factors for graft failure in AKI donor KTs. KTs from deceased donor with AKI showed comparable outcomes. Thus, donors with AKI need to be considered more actively to expand donor pool. Caution is still needed when donors have additional risk factors of graft failure.",

Kidneys from ≥65-year-old donors with comorbidities are more susceptible to cold ischemia time (CIT) and DGF and it is unknown whether such elderly kidneys with AKI can also be transplanted with satisfactory outcomes. All KTs from ≥65-year-old donors performed at our center from 1999 to 2019 (n = 233) were retrospectively analyzed and short- as well as long-term outcomes were compared for KTs from donors with (n = 64) and without AKI (n = 169). There were no significant differences regarding the frequency of DGF as well as the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 1 and 3 years post-transplant between the no-AKI and the AKI group (DGF: no-AKI 30.2% vs. AKI 40.6%, P = .17; eGFR at 1-year: 31.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 vs. 35.5 ml/min/1.73 m2 , P = .32; at 3-years: 33.8 ml/min/1.73 m2 vs. 40.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 , P = .18; respectively).

Twenty children on dialysis intended to perform a 12-week graded community-based exercise program. Exercise capacity and fatigue level were studied; muscle force and health-related quality of life were secondary outcomes. All outcomes were measured at baseline (T = 0) and after intervention (T = 1). Fourteen of the 20 patients (70%) either did not start the program or did not complete the program. Of these patients, seven did not complete or even start the exercise program because of a combination of lack of time and motivational problems. Six patients were not able to continue the program or were unable to do the follow-up measurements because of medical problems. Exercise capacity and muscle strength was higher after the exercise program in the children who completed the training. In conclusion, exercise training is difficult to perform in children with ESRD and is not always feasible in real-life situations for many children with ESRD.",

We assessed lower extremity strength (Biodex; dominant extension peak torque in 60 degrees per second, Newton-meters), grip strength (dynanometer, kilogram) and 6-min walk capacity (yards) in ten children (median age 13.6 years, range 8-25 years) at baseline and after 3 months of twice weekly exercise for 1 h during HD. Baseline assessment revealed a mean (1) Biodex of 70 +/- 32 N-m/s, (2) 6-m walk test of 589 +/- 90 yards and (3) grip strength of 23.2 +/- 10 kg, which were 50% lower than the normal value for healthy controls.

This study aimed to compare the effects of Nintendo Wii-based exergaming and home-based fun video exercises on functional capacity, muscle strength, physical activity (PA), depression, fatigue, and QoL in pediatric patients with CKD. Twenty-three pediatric patients with CKD were included in the study and randomized to group I (Nintendo Wii Fit) and group II (home-based fun video exercises). Patients in both groups underwent exercise programs twice per week for 6 weeks. Functional capacity, muscle strength, PA, QoL, fatigue, and depression of the patients were evaluated before and after the treatments. Sixteen patients completed the study. After treatment, significant differences were observed in both groups on 6MWT, muscle strength, average daily steps, PedsQoL Child Self-Report PHSS, and the Visual Fatigue Scale. Left knee flexor muscle strength and average step counts were found to be superior in group I. Both exergaming and home-based fun video exercises provide positive effects on functional capacity, muscle strength, fatigue, PA, depression, and QoL in pediatric patients with CKD.

Our previous study identified an NF-KappaB interacting lncRNA (NKILA) which was negatively correlated with breast cancer metastasis and patient prognosis. However, its clinical significance and potential role in Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) remain unclear. Here we show that NKILA is down-regulated in TSCC cancer tissues than that in matched adjacent noncancerous tissues. And low NKILA expression in TSCC is significantly correlated with tumor metastasis and poor patient prognosis. In vitro, overexpression of NKILA decreases TSCC cells migration and invasion. Mechanistic study shows that NKILA inhibits the phosphorylation of IκBα and NF-κB activation as well as the induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Ectopic expression of NKILA in Tscca cells inhibits NF-κB activator TNF-α-promoted cell migration and invasion, while applying NF-κB inhibitor Bay-117082 or JSH-23 in NKILA silenced CAL27 cells reverses cell migration capacity to lower level. In vivo experimental metastasis model also demonstrates NKILA inhibits lung metastasis of NOD/SCID mice with TSCC tumors. These results suggested that NKILA is a vital determinant of TSCC migration and invasion and NF-κB signaling pathway mediates this effect. Given the above mentioned function of NKILA, it could act as a potential predictor for overall survival in patients with TSCC and a potential therapeutic target for TSCC intervention.",

However, the clinical significance and biological roles of NKILA in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remain unknown. In this study, we showed that NKILA was downregulated in ESCC tissues and cancer cells compared with their normal counterparts. Low NKILA expression correlated with large tumor size and advanced TNM stage, and predicted poor overall and disease-free survival of ESCC patients. Further loss- and gain-of-function assays indicated that NKILA inhibited proliferation and migration of ESCC cells in vitro, suppressed tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, NKILA could inhibit phosphorylation of IκBα, suppress p65 nuclear translocation and downregulate the expression of NF-κB target genes in ESCC cells. These results suggest NKILA could suppress malignant development of ESCC via abrogation of the NF-κB signaling and may potentially serve as a prognostic marker for ESCC.",

Baicalein, a principle flavonoid, has shown attractive anti-cancer effects on HCC. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and influencing factors contributing to the anti-cancer effects of baicalein on HCC are still largely unknown. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been revealed to be fascinating therapeutic targets for cancers. The roles of NF-κB Interacting LncRNA (NKILA) are recently explored in several cancers. However, the expressions, clinical significances, roles and action mechanisms of NKILA in the anti-cancer effects of baicalein on HCC are unknown. In this study, we found that NKILA is down-regulated in HCC and reduced expression of NKILA indicts poor survival of HCC patients. Functional assays showed that overexpression of NKILA enhances the roles of baicalein on HCC cell proliferation inhibition, apoptosis induction, and migration inhibition in vitro and tumor growth suppression in vivo. Conversely, knockdown of NKILA suppresses the effects of baicalein. Mechanistically, we found that NKILA inhibits IκBα phosphorylation, NF-κB nuclear translocation, and NF-κB activity. NKILA also enhances the inhibitory effects of baicalein on NF-κB signaling. Furthermore, the effects of NKILA on baicalein-induced NF-κB activity inhibition, cell growth inhibition, apoptosis induction, and migration inhibition are reversed by NF-κB nuclear translocation inhibitor JSH-23.

NF-κB interacting lncRNA (NKILA) has been reported to serve as a tumor suppressor in several cancers through combining with NF-κB: IκB complex thereby inhibiting NF-κB activation. Herein, we demonstrated a low NKILA expression in laryngeal cancer and its correlation with shorter overall survival in patients with laryngeal cancer. NKILA serves as a tumor suppressor in laryngeal cancer by suppressing laryngeal cancer cell viability and migration, whereas promoting cell apoptosis; NKILA knockdown reverses the cytotoxicity of X-ray radiation on laryngeal cancer cells through combining with NF-κB: IκB complex to inhibit IκB phosphorylation, inhibit p65 nuclear translocation, and finally inhibit NF-κB activation. NF-κB binds to the promoter region of NKILA to activate its transcriptional activity, upregulated NKILA then inhibits IκB phosphorylation and NF-κB activation, thus forming a negative feedback loop to sensitize laryngeal cancer cell to X-ray radiation. In conclusion, NKILA can serve as a promising agent of enhancing the cytotoxicity of X-ray radiation on laryngeal cancer and addressing the radioresistance of laryngeal cancer.",

The gain-of-function study of NKILA in rectal cancer cell was conducted to evaluate the effect of NKILA on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and NF-κB signaling pathway. The results suggested NKILA expression was decreased in rectal cancer tissues and cells, and correlated with clinical stage, T classification, N classification and M classification.

The prognosis of patients with CRC at an advanced stage is poor. Biomarkers currently used in clinical practice, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen (CA) 19-9, lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity for early diagnosis and prediction, therefore there remains a requirement to improve the prognosis of patients with CRC. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been revealed to serve fundamental roles in various pathophysiological processes, including cancer initiation and progression. The present study investigated the expression and clinical significance of the lncRNA nuclear factor-κB interacting long non-coding RNA (NKILA) in CRC. It was identified that NKILA was downregulated in six CRC cell lines and tissues (n=173). Low NKILA expression was significantly associated with a poor differentiation grade, larger tumor size and advanced Tumor-Node-Metastases stages. Further statistical analyses revealed that low NKILA expression predicted poor overall survival (OS) rate and progression-free survival (PFS) rate. In addition, low NKILA expression was determined as an independent risk factor for poor OS and PFS. Furthermore, NKILA exhibited a relatively high sensitivity and specificity compared with CEA and CA19-9 in the early diagnosis of CRC. The serum level of NKILA was positively correlated with the level in tissues. In addition, a decreased NKILA level in serum was revealed to be partially restored post-operatively. In conclusion, low NKILA expression has been demonstrated to accelerate CRC progression and NKILA may be a potential novel biomarker in early diagnosis and prognosis of patients with CRC.",

Accumulating evidence has shown that both long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and NF-κB play vital roles in the regulation of cancer metastasis. However, the clinical significance and biological function of NKILA (NF-κB interacting lncRNA) and its interaction with NF-κB in HCC remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that NKILA was down-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines, and decreased NKILA expression was significantly associated with larger tumor size and positive vascular invasion in HCC patients. NKILA reduction was an independent risk factor of HCC patients' poor prognosis, and the 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of patients with low and high NKILA expression were 15.6% and 60.0%, respectively. Moreover, NKILA inhibits migration and invasion of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, NKILA prevents Slug/epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway via suppressing phosphorylation of IκBα, p65 nuclear translocation and NF-κB activation. In conclusion, these results indicate that NKILA might serve as an effective prognostic biomarker and a promising therapeutic target against HCC metastasis."

However, the contributions of lncRNAs to gastric carcinoma and their functional mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that lncRNA gastric carcinoma high expressed transcript 1 (lncRNA-GHET1) was up-regulated in gastric carcinoma. The over-expression of this lncRNA correlates with tumor size, tumor invasion and poor survival. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses demonstrated that GHET1 over-expression promotes the proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of GHET1 inhibits the proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells. RNA pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that GHET1 physically associates with insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) and enhances the physical interaction between c-Myc mRNA and IGF2BP1, consequently increasing the stability of c-Myc mRNA and expression. The expression of GHET1 and c-Myc is strongly correlated in gastric carcinoma tissues. Depletion of c-Myc abolishes the effects of GHET1 on proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that GHET1 plays a pivotal role in gastric carcinoma cell proliferation via increasing c-Myc mRNA stability and expression, which suggests potential use of GHET1 for the prognosis and treatment of gastric carcinoma.",

LncRNA gastric carcinoma high expressed transcript 1 lncRNA GHET1 is found to be dysregulated in gastric cancer (GC). However, its clinical value and potential biological function in HCC remains unclear. In this study, the expression level of GHET1 was analyzed in 72 HCC tissues and matched normal tissues by using Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). GHET1 expression was significantly up-regulated in HCC tissues and the higher level of GHET1 was related to vascular invasion, cirrhosis, tumor size, edmindson grade, and poor prognosis. Moreover, knockdown of GHET1 inhibited cell proliferation of HCC, and also caused cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis in HCC cell lines. We also found that GHET1 could epigenetically repress transcription of Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) in HCC cells by recruiting PRC2 into KLF2 promoter region.

        "# Title: Long non-coding RNA gastric carcinoma highly expressed transcript 1 promotes cell proliferation and invasion in human head and neck cancer.\n# Abstract: Recent evidence indicates that the long non-coding RNA gastric carcinoma highly expressed transcript 1 (GHET1) is involved in the development and carcinogenesis of several tumor types; however, the exact roles of GHET1 and its underlying mechanisms in head and neck cancer (HNC) remain largely unknown. In the present study, the expression patterns of GHET1 in HNC were determined and its clinical significance was assessed. The expression level of GHET1 was significantly increased in HNC tissues, compared with paired adjacent normal tissues. High GHET1 expression was significantly associated with advanced Tumor-Node-Metastasis stages and poor prognosis. Furthermore, inhibition of GHET1 suppressed cell proliferation, induced cell apoptosis and caused cell cycle arrest in vitro. In addition, GHET1 silencing inhibited cell migration and invasion. Taken together, the results of the present study indicated that GHET1 acts as an oncogene in HNC and may represent a novel therapeutic target.",

        "# Title: Knockdown of long noncoding RNA GHET1 inhibits cell‑cycle progression and invasion of gastric cancer cells.\n# Abstract: GHET1 is an oncogenic long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that promotes the proliferation and invasion of many malignant cell types. However, the function and underlying mechanisms of lncRNA GHET1 in gastric cancer are not fully understood. In this study, the expression of GHET1 was investigated in gastric cancer and it was determined whether GHET1 may potentially be used as a biomarker for the disease. The gastric cancer cell lines MGC‑803 and AGS were transfected with GHET1‑directed small interfering RNA (siRNA) and the changes in phenotype and cell‑cycle‑related molecules were assessed. The downregulation of GHET1 induced G0/G1‑phase arrest in gastric cancer cells and inhibited their proliferation, migration, and invasion. DNA synthesis and the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) decreased, which was consistent with the results of the CCK‑8 assay. The levels of specific cell‑cycle regulators were determined and the expression and activities of positive cell‑cycle regulators (cyclin D, CDK4, CDK6, cyclin E, CDK2) were reduced, whereas those of a negative regulator (P21) were increased in GHET1‑knockdown cells. Taken together, the present findings show that the downregulation of GHET1 not only inhibits the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells, but also inhibits their proliferation, at least in part by upregulating P21 expression and downregulating cyclin and CDK expression to inhibit the G0/G1 to S phase transition. The present findings may provide a potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer."

Herein, we evaluated plasma chemokines in patients with active tuberculosis (ATB) and after completing treatment (TTB) and compared them to BCG-vaccinated healthy controls (HC). Levels of chemokines were measured by cytometric bead array. Levels of CXCL8, CXCL9 and CXCL10 were higher in ATB patients compared to HC, but they decreased in TTB. Levels of CCL2 and CCL5 in ATB patients were similar to those observed in HC. Thus, the high levels of CXC-chemokines detected during ATB, which can modulate the trafficking of immune cells from the periphery to the site of infection, were reversed by anti-mycobacterial treatment.",
        "# Title: Beyond the IFN-γ horizon: biomarkers for immunodiagnosis of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\n# Abstract: Latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (LTBI) is defined by the presence of M. tuberculosis-specific immunity in the absence of active tuberculosis. LTBI is detected using interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) or the tuberculin-skin-test (TST). In clinical practice, IGRAs and the TSTs have failed to distinguish between active tuberculosis and LTBI and their predictive value to identify individuals at risk for the future development of tuberculosis is limited. There is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that improve the clinical performance of current immunodiagnostic methods for tuberculosis prevention, diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Here, we review the landscape of potential alternative biomarkers useful for detection of infection with M. tuberculosis. We describe what individual markers add in terms of specificity for active/latent infection, prediction of progression to active tuberculosis and immunodiagnostic potential in high-risk groups' such as HIV-infected individuals and children.",
        "# Title: Diagnostic performance of a cytokine and IFN-γ-induced chemokine mRNA assay after Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigen stimulation in whole blood from infected individuals.\n# Abstract: Interferon (IFN)-γ release assays have limited sensitivity and cannot differentiate between active tuberculosis (TB) disease and latent TB infection (LTBI). Numerous cytokines and regulator factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis and control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Additional cytokines and chemokines associated with M. tuberculosis infection may improve the performance of IFN-γ release assays. We developed a real-time RT-PCR TaqMan assay for targeting levels of eight human targets [IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-10, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11] and evaluated the assay with three different study groups. Results showed that the sensitivity of TNF-α, IL-2R, and CXCL10 in the active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) group was 96.43%, 96.43%, and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity of IL-2R and CXCL10 in the latent tuberculosis infection group was 86.36% and 81.82%, respectively. Statistical results showed that TNF-α and CXCL9 were the best individual markers for differentiating between the PTB, LTBI, and non-TB groups. For optimal sensitivity and differentiation of M. tuberculosis infection status, the simultaneous detection of multiple targets was attempted. The combination of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2R, and the combination of TNF-α, IL-2R, CXCL9, and CXCL10 showed the best performance for detecting active PTB (both 100% positivity) and LTBI (86.36% and 81.82% positivity, respectively). These results imply that the combination of suitable markers is useful in efficiently diagnosing TB and differentiating M. tuberculosis infection status.",

        "# Title: Identification of novel host biomarkers in plasma as candidates for the immunodiagnosis of tuberculosis disease and monitoring of tuberculosis treatment response.\n# Abstract: There is an urgent need for new tools for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis disease. We evaluated the potentials of 74 host markers as biomarkers for the immunological diagnosis of tuberculosis and monitoring of treatment response. Fifty-five individuals that presented with signs and symptoms requiring investigation for tuberculosis disease were prospectively recruited prior to clinical diagnosis, at a health centre in Cape Town, South Africa. Patients were later classified as having tuberculosis disease or other respiratory diseases (ORD) using a combination of clinical, radiological and laboratory findings. Out of 74 host markers that were evaluated in plasma samples from study participants using a multiplex platform, 18 showed potential as tuberculosis diagnostic candidates with the most promising being NCAM, CRP, SAP, IP-10, ferritin, TPA, I-309, and MIG, which diagnosed tuberculosis disease individually, with area under the ROC curve ≥0.80. Six-marker biosignatures containing NCAM diagnosed tuberculosis disease with a sensitivity of 100% (95%CI, 86.3-100%) and specificity of 89.3% (95%CI, 67.6-97.3%) irrespective of HIV status, and 100% accuracy in the absence of HIV infection. Furthermore, the concentrations of 11 of these proteins changed with treatment, thereby indicating that they may be useful in monitoring of the response to tuberculosis treatment. Our findings have potential to be translated into a point-of-care screening test for tuberculosis, after future validation studies.",
        "# Title: Identification of plasma biomarkers for discrimination between tuberculosis infection/disease and pulmonary non tuberculosis disease.\n# Abstract: We used the Luminex Bead Array Multiplex Immunoassay to measure cytokines, chemokines and growth factors responses to the same antigens used for RD1-based Interferon γ Release Assay (IGRA) test. Seventy-nine individuals, 27 active TB, 32 latent infection subsets, 20 individuals derivative purified protein (PPD) negative (subjects that do not have any indurative cutaneous reaction after 72 hrs of intradermal injection of PPD) and with other pulmonary disease were retrospectively studied. Forty-eight analytes were evaluated by Luminex Assay in plasma obtained from whole blood stimulated cells. The diagnostic accuracies of the markers detected were evaluated by ROC curve analysis and by the combination of multiple biomarkers to improve the potential to discriminate between infection/disease and non infection. Among 48 cytokines, 13 analytes, namely IL-3, IL-12-p40, LIF, IFNα2, IL-2ra, IL-13, b-NGF, SCF, TNF-β, TRAIL, IL-2, IFN-γ, IP-10, and MIG, were significantly higher in the active TB and LTBI groups, compared to NON-TB patients, while MIF was significantly lower in active TB patients compared to NON-TB and LTBI groups. The diagnostic accuracies of the markers detected in the culture supernatants evaluated by ROC curve analysis revealed that 11 analytes (IL2, IP10, IFN-γ, IL13, MIG, SCF, b-NGF, IL12-p40, TRAIL, IL2 Ra, LIF) discriminated between NON-TB and LTBI groups, with AUC for all analytes ≥0.73, while 14 analytes (IL2, IP10, IFN-γ, MIG, SCF, b-NGF, IL12-p40, TRAIL, IL2Ra, MIF, TNF-β, IL3, IFN-α2, LIF) discriminated between NON-TB and active TB groups, with AUC ≥0.78, that is a moderate, value in terms of accuracy of a diagnostic test. Finally, the combinations of seven biomarkers resulted in the accurate prediction of 88.89% of active TB patients, 82.35% of subjects with latent infection and 90% of non-TB patients, respectively. Taken together, our data suggest that combinations of whole blood Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) antigen dependent cytokines production could be useful as biomarkers to determine tuberculosis disease states when compared to non TB cohort.",
