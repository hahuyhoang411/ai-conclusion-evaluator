      "referenceConclusion": "In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggested that a higher dose of rifampin could significantly increase the pharmacokinetic parameters containing plasma and CSF concentration and the plasma AUC 0−24 , without a remarkable increase of adverse reactions. This phenomenon may indicate the idea that the crucial drug in the antituberculosis regimen was used in a low dose, more studies are required to shed light on this question. However, we found that there was no improvement in the treatment outcome. In terms of efficacy, more work will need to be done, especially large sample size phase III studies to determine the effect of an intensified regimen including a higher dose of rifampin.",

        "conclusionB": "Increasing the oral dose of rifampin to 35 mg/kg in adults with tuberculous meningitis results in comparable plasma drug exposures – as measured by AUC0-24 – to intravenous administration of 20 mg/kg, supporting the feasibility of utilizing higher oral doses in future clinical trials evaluating treatment efficacy."
