      "# Title: Expression of a hepatitis A virus antigen in Lactococcus lactis and Escherichia coli and evaluation of its immunogenicity.\n# Abstract: An epidemic shift in Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection has been observed in recent years in rapidly developing countries, with increasing numbers of severe adult cases which has led to renewed interest in vaccination. Our approach in vaccine development uses recombinant expression of the highly immunogenic HAV antigen VP1-P2a in food-grade lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis and in Escherichia coli. We used genetic constructs that enable nisin-controlled expression of the antigen in L. lactis in three different forms: (a) intracellularly, (b) on the bacterial surface and (c) on the bacterial surface fused with the fragment of the E. coli flagellin molecule that can act as a molecular adjuvant. Expression of the two surface forms of the antigen was achieved in L. lactis, and the resulting antigen-displaying bacteria were administered orally to mice. Half the animals in each of the two groups developed specific IgGs, with titers increasing over time and reaching 1:422 without flagellin and 1:320 with flagellin. A much higher titer 1:25,803 was observed with the parenterally administered antigen, which was purified from E. coli. With the latter, a significant mucosal IgA response was also observed. Despite significant titers, the IgGs elicited with oral or parenteral administration could not prevent HAV from infecting cells in a virus neutralization assay, suggesting that the antibodies cannot recognize viral surface epitopes. Nevertheless, orally administered HAV antigen expressed in L. lactis elicited significant systemic humoral immune response showing the feasibility for development of effective HAV vaccine for mucosal delivery.",
      "# Title: Oral immunization with recombinant Lactococcus lactis delivering a multi-epitope antigen CTB-UE attenuates Helicobacter pylori infection in mice.\n# Abstract: Urease is an essential virulence factor and colonization factor for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and is considered as an excellent vaccine candidate antigen. However, conventional technologies for preparing an injectable vaccine require purification of the antigenic protein and preparation of an adjuvant. Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 (L. lactis) could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of edible vaccine. In previous study, we constructed a multi-epitope vaccine, designated CTB-UE, which is composed of the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), three Th cell epitopes and two B-cell epitopes from urease subunits. To develop a novel type of oral vaccine against H. pylori, genetically modified L. lactis strains were established to secrete this epitope vaccine extracellularly in this study. Oral prophylactic immunization with recombinant L. lactis significantly elicited humoral anti-urease antibody responses (P < 0.001) and reduced the gastric colonization of H. pylori from 7.14 ± 0.95 to 4.68 ± 0.98 log10 CFU g(-1) stomach. This L. lactis oral vaccine offers a promising vaccine candidate for the control of H. pylori infection.",
      "# Title: Development of a new DNA vaccine based on mycobacterial ESAT-6 antigen delivered by recombinant invasive Lactococcus lactis FnBPA+.\n# Abstract: The use of the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis as a vehicle for the oral delivery of DNA vaccine plasmids constitutes a promising strategy for vaccination. The delivery of DNA plasmids into eukaryotic cells is of critical importance for subsequent DNA expression and effectiveness of the vaccine. In this context, the use of the recombinant invasive L. lactis FnBPA+ (fibronectin-binding protein A) strain for the oral delivery of the eukaryotic expression vector vaccination using lactic acid bacteria (pValac), coding for the 6-kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6) gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, could represent a new DNA vaccine strategy against tuberculosis. To this end, the ESAT-6 sequence was cloned into the pValac vector; the L. lactis fibronectin-binding protein A (FnBPA)+ (pValac:ESAT-6) strain was obtained, and its immunological profile was checked in BALB/c mice. This strain was able to significantly increase interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production in spleen cells, showing a systemic T helper 1 (Th1) cell response. The mice also showed a significant increase in specific secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) production in colon tissue and fecal extracts. Thus, this is the first time that L. lactis has been used to deliver a plasmid DNA harboring a gene that encodes an antigen against tuberculosis through mucous membranes.",
      "# Title: Lactococcus lactis displayed neuraminidase confers cross protective immunity against influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Influenza A viruses pose a serious threat to public health. Current influenza A vaccines predominantly focus on hemagglutinin (HA) and show strain-specific protection. Neuraminidase (NA) is much less studied in the context of humoral immunity against influenza A viruses. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cross protective immunity of NA presented on Lactococcus lactis (L.lactis) surface against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in the mouse model. L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA was constructed in which pgsA was used as an anchor protein. Mice vaccinated orally with L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA could elicit significant NA-specific serum IgG and mucosa IgA antibodies, as well as neuraminidase inhibition (NI) titers. Importantly, L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA provided 80% protection against H5N1, 60% protection against H3N2 and H1N1, respectively. These findings suggest that recombinant L.lactis/pNZ110-pgsA-NA in the absence of adjuvant via oral administration can be served as an effective vaccine candidate against diverse strains of influenza A viruses.",
      "# Title: Broadly protective immunity against divergent influenza viruses by oral co-administration of Lactococcus lactis expressing nucleoprotein adjuvanted with cholera toxin B subunit in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines need to be annually reformulated to well match the predicated circulating strains. Thus, it is critical for developing a novel universal influenza vaccine that would be able to confer cross-protection against constantly emerging divergent influenza virus strains. Influenza virus A is a genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses. Influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) is a structural protein which encapsidates the negative strand viral RNA, and anti-NP antibodies play role in cross-protective immunity. Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) is an ideal vaccine delivery vehicle via oral administration route. However, L. lactis vectored vaccine exhibits poor immunogenicity without the use of mucosal adjuvant. To enhance the immunogenicity of L. lactis vectored vaccine, cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit, one of mucosal adjuvants, is a safe adjuvant for oral route, when combined with L. lactis vectored vaccine. In this study, we hypothesized that pNZ8008, a L. lactis expression plasmid, encoding NP antigen, would be able to elicit cross-protection with the use of CTB via oral administration route.",
      "# Title: Cross-protection of Lactococcus lactis-displayed HA2 subunit against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines provide strain-specific protection against homologous subtypes and need to be updated annually. Therefore, it is essential to develop a universal vaccine that would induce broadly cross-protective immunity against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses. The highly conserved HA2 subunit is a promising candidate for developing a universal influenza vaccine. Here, we hypothesized that the HA2 subunit could be displayed on the surface of Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis), using Spax as an anchor protein (L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2) and that L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 would have immunogenicity by oral administration without the use of adjuvant in the mouse model. To address this hypothesis, we show that oral vaccination of mice with L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 elicited significant humoral and mucosal immune responses. Importantly, L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 provided 100% protection against homologous H5N1 or heterologous H1N1 virus challenge. These results suggest that an HA2 subunit presented on the surface of L. lactis is an effective universal vaccine candidate against influenza A viruses in the poultry industry and in humans.",
      "# Title: Oral Immunization with a Recombinant Lactococcus lactis-Expressing HIV-1 Antigen on Group A Streptococcus Pilus Induces Strong Mucosal Immunity in the Gut.\n# Abstract: The induction of a potent humoral and cellular immune response in mucosal tissue is important for the development of an effective HIV vaccine. Most of the current HIV vaccines under development use the i.m. route for immunization, which is relatively poor in generating potent and long-lived mucosal immune responses. In this article, we explore the ability of an oral vaccination with a probiotic organism, Lactococcus lactis, to elicit HIV-specific immune responses in the mucosal and systemic compartments of BALB/c mice. We expressed the HIV-1 Gag-p24 on the tip of the T3 pilus of Streptococcus pyogenes as a fusion to the Cpa protein (LL-Gag). After four monthly LL-Gag oral immunizations, we observed strong Gag-specific IgG and IgA responses in serum, feces, and vaginal secretions. However, the Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses in the blood were at or below our detection limit. After an i.m. modified vaccinia Ankara/Gag boost, we observed robust Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses both in systemic and in mucosal tissues, including intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes of the small intestine, Peyer's patches, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Consistent with strong immunogenicity, the LL-Gag induced activation of CD11c(+) CD11b(+) dendritic cells in the Peyer's patches after oral immunization. Our results demonstrate that oral immunization with L. lactis expressing an Ag on the tip of the group A Streptococcus pilus serves as an excellent vaccine platform to induce strong mucosal humoral and cellular immunity against HIV.",

      "# Title: Production and delivery of Helicobacter pylori NapA in Lactococcus lactis and its protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity.\n# Abstract: Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein A subunit (NapA) has been identified as a virulence factor, a protective antigen and a potent immunomodulator. NapA shows unique application potentials for anti-H. pylori vaccines and treatment strategies of certain allergic diseases and carcinomas. However, appropriate production and utilization modes of NapA still remain uncertain to date. This work has established a novel efficient production and utilization mode of NapA by using L. lactis as an expression host and delivery vector, and demonstrated immune protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity of the engineered L. lactis by oral vaccination of mice. It was observed for the first time that H. pylori NapA promotes both polarized Th17 and Th1 responses, which may greatly affect the clinical application of NapA. This report offers a promising anti-H. pylori oral vaccine candidate and a potent mucosal immune modulatory agent. Meanwhile, it uncovers a way to produce and deliver the oral vaccine and immunomodulator by fermentation of food like milk, which might have striking effects on control of H. pylori infection, gastrointestinal cancers, and Th2 bias allergic diseases, including many food allergies.",
      "# Title: Protective immunity induced by an intranasal multivalent vaccine comprising 10 Lactococcus lactis strains expressing highly prevalent M-protein antigens derived from Group A Streptococcus.\n# Abstract: Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) causes diseases ranging from mild pharyngitis to severe invasive infections. The N-terminal fragment of streptococcal M protein elicits protective antibodies and is an attractive vaccine target. However, this N- terminal fragment is hypervariable: there are more than 200 different M types. In this study, an intranasal live bacterial vaccine comprising 10 strains of Lactococcus lactis, each expressing one N-terminal fragment of M protein, has been developed. Live bacterial-vectored vaccines cost less to manufacture because the processes involved are less complex than those required for production of protein subunit vaccines. Moreover, intranasal administration does not require syringes or specialized personnel. Evaluation of individual vaccine types (M1, M2, M3, M4, M6, M9, M12, M22, M28 and M77) showed that most of them protected mice against challenge with virulent S. pyogenes. All 10 strains combined in a 10-valent vaccine (M×10) induced serum and bronchoalveolar lavage IgG titers that ranged from three- to 10-fold those of unimmunized mice. After intranasal challenge with M28 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice was significantly higher than that of unimmunized mice. In contrast, when mice were challenged with M75 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice did not differ significantly from that of unimmunized mice. Mx-10 immunized mice had significantly less S. pyogenes in oropharyngeal washes and developed less severe disease symptoms after challenge than did unimmunized mice. Our L. lactis-based vaccine may provide an alternative solution to development of broadly protective group A streptococcal vaccines.",
      "# Title: Mucosal and systemic immune responses elicited by recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a fusion protein composed of pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin from Bordetella pertussis.\n# Abstract: We constructed a food-grade expression system harboring a F1S1 fusion protein of Bordetella pertussis to be produced in Lactococcus lactis NZ3900 as a new oral vaccine model against whooping cough, caused by B. pertussis. F1S1 was composed of N-terminally truncated S1 subunit of pertussis toxin and type I immunodominant domain of filamentous hemagglutinin which are both known as protective immunogens against pertussis. The recombinant L. lactis was administered via oral or intranasal routes to BALB/c mice and the related specific systemic and mucosal immune responses were then evaluated. The results indicated significantly higher levels of specific IgA in the lung extracts and IgG in sera of mucosally-immunized mice, compared to their controls. It was revealed that higher levels of IgG2a, compared to IgG1, were produced in all mucosally-immunized mice. Moreover, immunized mice developed Th1 responses with high levels of IFN-γ production by the spleen cells. These findings provide evidence for L. lactis to be used as a suitable vehicle for expression and delivery of F1S1 fusion protein to mucosa and induction of appropriate systemic and mucosal immune responses against pertussis.",
      "# Title: Rotavirus VP6 protein mucosally delivered by cell wall-derived particles from Lactococcus lactis induces protection against infection in a murine model.\n# Abstract: Rotaviruses are the primary cause of acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide. Although the implementation of live attenuated vaccines has reduced the number of rotavirus-associated deaths, variance in their effectiveness has been reported in different countries. This fact, among other concerns, leads to continuous efforts for the development of new generation of vaccines against rotavirus.In this work, we describe the obtention of cell wall-derived particles from a recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a cell wall-anchored version of the rotavirus VP6 protein. After confirming by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, flow cytometry and electronic immunomicroscopy that these particles were carrying the VP6 protein, their immunogenic potential was evaluated in adult BALB/c mice. For that, mucosal immunizations (oral or intranasal), with or without the dmLT [(double mutant Escherichia coli heat labile toxin LT(R192G/L211A)] adjuvant were performed. The results showed that these cell wall-derived particles were able to generate anti-rotavirus IgG and IgA antibodies only when administered intranasally, whether the adjuvant was present or not. However, the presence of dmLT was necessary to confer protection against rotavirus infection, which was evidenced by a 79.5 percent viral shedding reduction.In summary, this work describes the production of cell wall-derived particles which were able to induce a protective immune response after intranasal immunization. Further studies are needed to characterize the immune response elicited by these particles as well as to determine their potential as an alternative to the use of live L. lactis for mucosal antigen delivery.",
      "# Title: Extracellular overproduction of E7 oncoprotein of Iranian human papillomavirus type 16 by genetically engineered Lactococcus lactis.\n# Abstract: We aimed at constructing Lactococcus lactis strains expressing HPV-16 recombinant E7 (rE7) oncoprotein and examining its overproduction ability followed by optimizing batch and fed-batch fermentations. Thereafter, in order to assess the immunogenicity of recombinant L. lactis cells, C57BL/6 mice were immunized by oral gavage.",
      "# Title: A Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB)-Based Vaccine Candidate for Human Norovirus.\n# Abstract: Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are responsible for more than 95% of the non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis epidemics in the world. The CDC estimates that every year 21 million individuals suffer from HuNoV-induced gastroenteritis in the United States. Currently, there is no FDA-approved vaccine for HuNoVs. Development of an effective vaccine has been hampered by the lack of an efficient cell culture system for HuNoVs and a suitable small animal model for pathogenesis study. In this study, we developed lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as a vector to deliver HuNoV antigen. A LAB strain (Lactococcus lactis) carrying VP1 gene of a HuNoV GII.4 virus (LAB-VP1) was constructed. It was found that HuNoV VP1 protein was highly expressed by LAB vector and was secreted into media supernatants. To test whether LAB-based HuNoV vaccine candidate is immunogenic, 4-day-old gnotobiotic piglets were orally inoculated with various doses of LAB-VP1. It was found that LABs were persistent in the small intestine of piglets and shed in pig feces for at least 25 days post inoculation. LAB DNA and VP1 were detected in mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen tissue in LAB-VP1 inoculated groups. HuNoV-specific IgG and IgA were detectable in serum and feces respectively at day 13 post-inoculation, and further increased at later time points. After being challenged with HuNoV GII.4 strain, a large amount of HuNoV antigens were observed in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum sections of the intestine in the LAB control group. In contrast, significantly less, or no, HuNoV antigens were detected in the LAB-VP1 immunized groups. Collectively, these results demonstrate that a LAB-based HuNoV vaccine induces protective immunity in gnotobiotic piglets.",

      "# Title: Mucosal Vaccination with Lactococcus lactis-Secreting Surface Immunological Protein Induces Humoral and Cellular Immune Protection against Group B Streptococcus in a Murine Model.\n# Abstract: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the primary etiological agent of sepsis and meningitis in newborns and is associated with premature birth and stillbirth. The development of a licensed vaccine is one of the pending challenges for the World Health Organization. Previously, we showed that oral immunization with surface immune protein (SIP) decreases vaginal colonization of GBS and generates functional opsonizing antibodies, which was determined by opsonophagocytic assays (OPA) in vitro. We also showed that the protein has an adjuvant vaccine profile. Therefore, an oral vaccine based on SIP may be an attractive alternative to employ in the development of new vaccines against GBS. Lactococcus lactis is a highlighted oral vaccine probiotic inducer of the mucosal immune response. This bacterium could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of an edible vaccine and has been used in clinical trials. In this study, we showed that an oral vaccine with a recombinant L. lactis strain secreting SIP from GBS (rL. lactis-SIP) can induce protective humoral and cellular immunity in an experimental model of GBS vaginal colonization in C57BL/6 mice. Mice immunized with rL. lactis-SIP were protected against clinical symptoms and bacterial colonization after GBS vaginal colonization. Our rL. lactis-SIP vaccine also induces an increase of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) specifically against SIP. The adoptive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice to naïve mice generated protection against GBS vaginal colonization. Moreover, the rL. lactis-SIP strain induces the activation of SIP-specific T cells, which could decrease GBS vaginal colonization and generate protective antibodies when transferred to other mice. Our experimental observations strongly support the notion that rL. lactis-SIP induces protective humoral and cellular immunity and could be considered as a novel alternative in the development of vaccines for GBS.",
      "# Title: Recombinant Lactococcus Lactis Displaying Omp31 Antigen of Brucella melitensis Can Induce an Immunogenic Response in BALB/c Mice.\n# Abstract: Since Brucella infection mostly occurs through the mucosal surfaces, immune response induced by vaccine that is delivered by a way of mucosal route can be drastically enhanced to control the brucellosis. Omp31is the major outer membrane protein of Brucella, and is considered as a protective antigen against Brucella infection. Accordingly, Lactococcus lactis has been used as an antigen-delivering vector to develop a vaccine-induced mucosal response for having a safer vaccination against brucellosis. A designed omp31 gene fused to the usp45 signal peptide and M6 cell wall anchor was sub cloned in the pNZ7021 expression vector, and a recombinant L. lactis displaying Omp31 was constructed. Omp31 protein expression was confirmed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. Animals were orally and intraperitoneally immunized with live or killed L. lactis expressing Omp31, respectively. The humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated by measuring the specific cytokines and antibodies. sIgA, serum IgA, IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in the mice immunized with live recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31 and also serum IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in mice immunized with killed recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31. Among IgG subtypes, IgG2a response was significantly higher in both groups compared to IgG1. In mice groups immunized with recombinant L. lactis, the IFN-γ and IL-10 level elevated; however, there was no change in the level of IL-4. These results indicated that recombinants L. lactis induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, and also vaccines based on L. lactis-derived live carriers are promising interventions against Brucella melitensis infections.",
      "# Title: Lactococcus lactis FNBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) Induces Cellular and Humoral Immune Responses After Oral Immunization of Mice.\n# Abstract: The development of a new vaccine strategy against tuberculosis is urgently needed and has been greatly encouraged by the scientific community worldwide. In this work, we constructed a lactococcal DNA vaccine based on the fusion of two Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens, ESAT-6 and Ag85A, and examined its immunogenicity. The coding sequences of the ESAT-6 and Ag85A genes were fused and cloned into the eukaryotic expression pValac vector, and the functionality of the vector was confirmed in vitro. Then, L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) was obtained and used for oral immunization of mice. This strain induced significant increases in IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-17 cytokines in stimulated splenocyte cultures, and significant production of antigen-specific sIgA was observed in the colonic tissues of immunized mice. We demonstrated that L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) generated a cellular and humoral immune response after oral immunization of mice. The strategy developed in this work may represent an interesting DNA mucosal vaccine candidate against tuberculosis, using the fusion of two highly immunogenic antigens delivered by safe lactic acid bacteria.",
      "# Title: Protective Immunity Against Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli by Oral Vaccination of Engineered Lactococcus lactis.\n# Abstract: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the leading causes of diarrhea in children globally, and thus suitable vaccines are desired. Antigen display on lactic acid bacteria is a reliable approach for efficient oral vaccination and preventing bowel diseases. To develop an oral vaccine against ETEC, the gene of the binding domain from heat-labile toxin (LTB), a key ETEC virulence factor, was codon-optimized and cloned into a construct containing a signal peptide and an anchor for display on L. lactis. Bioinformatics analysis showed a codon adaptation index of 0.95 for the codon-optimized gene. Cell surface expression of LTB was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and blotting. White New Zealand rabbits were immunized per os (PO) with the recombinant L. lactis, and the antibody titers were assayed with ELISA. In vitro neutralization assay was performed using mouse adrenal tumor cells and rabbit ileal loop test was performed as the in vivo assay. ELISA results indicated that oral administration of the engineered L. lactis elicited a significant production of IgA in the intestine. In vitro neutralization assay showed that the effect of the toxin could be neutralized with 500 µg/ml of IgG isolated from the oral vaccine group. Furthermore, the dose of ETEC causing fluid accumulation in the ileal loop test showed a tenfold increase in rabbits immunized with either recombinant L. lactis or LTB protein compared to other groups. Our results imply that recombinant L. lactis could potentially be an effective live oral vaccine against ETEC toxicity.",
      "# Title: Oral Immunization of Mice with Cell Extracts from Recombinant Lactococcus lactis Expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein.\n# Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all over the world and became a pandemic that named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). At present, several intramuscular vaccines have been successfully developed and mass vaccination has progressed in many countries. The aim of the study is to develop and examine an oral vaccine against COVID-19 with recombinant Lactococcus lactis IL1403, a strain of lactic acid bacteria, expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) S1 subunit as an immunizing antigen. PBS or cell extracts from recombinant L. lactis were orally administered into mice (control VS treatment), and formation of antigen-specific antibodies and changes in the gut microbiome were analyzed. Intracellular antigen was detected, but its secretion was not successful. After immunization, antigen-specific serum IgG and fecal IgA levels were 1.5-fold (P = 0.002) and 1.4-fold (P = 0.016) higher in the immunized mice (treatment) than control, respectively. Gut microbiome profiles were clearly separated between the two groups when analyzed for beta diversity with overall similarity. At the genus level, while Coprococcus (P = 0.036) and unclassified genus of Ruminococcaceae (P = 0.037) in treatment were more abundant than control, rc4-4 (P = 0.013) and Stenotrophomonas (P = 0.021) were less abundant. Our results indicate that cell extract containing SARS-CoV-2 antigen can induce mice to produce antigen-specific antibodies without overall changes in the gut microbiome. This strategy may be useful for the development of other oral viral vaccines.",
      "# Title: Oral Immunization With a M Cell-Targeting Recombinant L. Lactis Vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE Stimulate Protective Immunity Against H. Pylori in Mice.\n# Abstract: There are many virulence factors of H. pylori that contribute in diverse ways to gastric disease. Therefore, designing multivalent epitope vaccines against many key virulence factors virulence factors of H. pylori is a promising strategy to control H. pylori infection. In previous studies, we constructed a multivalent epitope vaccine FVpE against four key virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), and oral immunization with the FVpE vaccine plus a polysaccharide adjuvant (PA) containing lycium barbarum polysaccharide and chitosan could provide protection against H. pylori infection in the Mongolian gerbil model. Oral vaccines have many advantages over injected vaccines, such as improved safety and compliance, and easier manufacturing and administration. However, the harsh gastrointestinal (GI) environment, such as gastric acid and proteolytic enzymes, limits the development of oral vaccines to some extent. Oral vaccines need a gastrointestinal delivery system with high safety, low price and promoting vaccine antigen to stimulate immune response in the gastrointestinal mucosa. Lactic acid bacteria are gastrointestinal probiotics that have unique advantages as a delivery system for oral vaccines. In this study, a M cell-targeting surface display system for L. lactis named plSAM was designed to help vaccine antigens to stimulate effective immune responses in the gastrointestinal tract, and a M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE was constructed by using the surface display system plSAM. recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE could secretively express the SAM-FVpE protein and display it on the bacterial surface. Moreover, experimental results confirmed that LL-plSAM-FVpE had an enhanced M cell-targeting property. In addition, LL-plSAM-FVpE had excellent M cell-targeting property to promote the phagocytosis and transport of the antigen SAM-FVpE by gastrointestinal M cells. More importantly, oral immunization of LL-plSAM-FVpE or SAM-FVpE plus PA can stimulate IgG and sIgA antibodies and CD4+ T cell immune responses against four virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), thus providing protective immunity against H. pylori infection in mice. The M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine against various key H. pylori virulence factors could be a promising vaccine candidate for controlling H. pylori infection.",
      "# Title: Oral and intranasal immunization with food-grade recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing high conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein triggers mice's immunity responses.\n# Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic began at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread throughout the world. Vaccination is still the most effective method of prevention of pathogenic infections, including viral infections. However, there is little evidence that vaccination can protect against SARS-CoV-2 virus for a long time. Thus, regular re-vaccination is necessary to control COVID-19. Vaccination by injection is invasive, and is one of the reasons people refuse to get re-vaccinated. Therefore, we developed a less invasive vaccine based on oral or nasal administration. The gene encoding the high conserved region (HCR) spike protein was inserted into pNZ8149 and expressed in L.lactis NZ3900. Mice were immunized at 3-week intervals with oral or nasal routes. Anti-SARS-CoV2 spike antibody (IgG and IgA) level were measured using ELISA method before and after treatment. Plasma cells population in lymph were analyzed using flowcytometry and the CD4 + and CD8 + cells in lymph and intestine were analyzed using immunofluorescence method. The results of nasal and oral administration in experimental animals showed that L.lactis carrying the HCR gene could induce a humoral immune response, as indicated by increased levels of IgG and IgA against SARS-CoV-2 (IgG/IgA-SARS-CoV-2). The plasma cell population after nasal and oral vaccination in mice were significantly different with control group (p < 0.05). The CD4 + and CD8 + cells in intestine were significantly higher in orally immunized group mice than control group. The CD8 + cells in lymph were significantly higher in intranasal immunized group mice than control group. Our data demonstrate L.lactis expressing spike protein can be developed into a less invasive alternative to nasal and oral vaccination.",
      "# Title: Expanding strain coverage of a group A Streptococcus pilus-expressing Lactococcus lactis mucosal vaccine.\n# Abstract: Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a human pathogenic bacterium that can trigger a wide range of diseases, including the autoimmune diseases acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, causing major morbidity and mortality in many low- and middle-income countries. Primary intervention programs have had limited success thus far, and a licensed vaccine has yet to be developed. The pilus of GAS is known to be involved in host cell adhesion, biofilm formation and immune evasion. We have a mucosal vaccine in development that expresses the pilus of GAS on the surface of the nonpathogenic bacterium Lactococcus lactis. To expand strain coverage, we combined seven L. lactis constructs, each expressing a different GAS pilus variant, and investigated the systemic and mucosal immune responses following immunization. Mice immunized with this combination showed specific immunoglobin G and immunoglobin A responses to the GAS pilus proteins of vaccine strains, at levels comparable to mice immunized with a single construct. Cross-reactivity to pilus proteins of nonvaccine strains was also evident. Furthermore, protective efficacy against a homologous strain of GAS in a murine nasopharyngeal colonization model was observed. Overall, this study provides further evidence for using pilus-expressing lactic acid bacteria as a vaccine to prevent upper respiratory tract GAS infections."

    "referenceConclusion": "Moderate level of evidence demonstrated that both R18 and R18D administration can significantly improve stroke outcomes in animal stroke models. However, considering the limitations, further pre‐clinical and clinical studies are warranted to substantiate the neuroprotective efficacy of polyarginines for stroke. The present study results showed promising effects regarding the efficacy of administering polyarginines of R18 and R18D in improving functional status and neurological outcomes and decreasing infarct size following the induction of stroke in rats. Moreover, R18 effectively reduced brain edema in animal models of stroke. All of the mentioned effects were supported by a moderate level of evidence. However, while these results are subjected to certain limitations, the pre‐clinical data are highly encouraging and provide the support for the translation of polyarginine peptides as possible clinical stroke therapeutics.",

      "# Title: Therapeutic effects of a reducible poly (oligo-D-arginine) carrier with the heme oxygenase-1 gene in the treatment of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.\n# Abstract: Non-viral carriers for gene therapy have been developed to minimize carrier cytotoxicity and to enhance transfection efficiency. Previously, we synthesized a 9-arginine-based reducible high molecular weight peptide for gene delivery. For the reducible poly(oligo-D-arginines) (rPOA), 9-arginine oligopeptides are connected by internal disulfide linkages to produce a high molecular weight peptide. In this study, rPOA was evaluated as a carrier of the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene for the treatment of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) -induced brain stroke. An in vitro transfection assay showed that rPOA had higher transfection efficiency and lower toxicity than polyethylenimine (PEI). For in vivo evaluation, I/R rat models were produced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). rPOA/HO-1 expression plasmid (pHO-1) polyplexes were injected into the brain at 1 h before MCAO, and HO-1 expression levels in the brain were then measured by ELISA. The results indicated that rPOA/pHO-1 polyplexes had higher transfection efficiencies than PEI/pHO-1 polyplexes. The rPOA/pHO-1 polyplexes significantly reduced infarct volumes. In addition, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) was reduced in the rPOA/pHO-1 polyplex injection group, suggesting that HO-1 had an anti-inflammatory effect, while the PEI/pHO-1 polyplex did not show this effect. These results suggest that rPOA is a potential non-viral vector for HO-1 gene therapy to protect brain cells from I/R-related neuronal injury including stroke.",
      "# Title: Poly-arginine and arginine-rich peptides are neuroprotective in stroke models.\n# Abstract: Using cortical neuronal cultures and glutamic acid excitotoxicity and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) stroke models, we demonstrated that poly-arginine and arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), are highly neuroprotective, with efficacy increasing with increasing arginine content, have the capacity to reduce glutamic acid-induced neuronal calcium influx and require heparan sulfate preotoglycan-mediated endocytosis to induce a neuroprotective effect. Furthermore, neuroprotection could be induced with immediate peptide treatment or treatment up to 2 to 4 hours before glutamic acid excitotoxicity or OGD, and with poly-arginine-9 (R9) when administered intravenously after stroke onset in a rat model. In contrast, the JNKI-1 peptide when fused to the (non-arginine) kFGF CPP, which does not rely on endocytosis for uptake, was not neuroprotective in the glutamic acid model; the kFGF peptide was also ineffective. Similarly, positively charged poly-lysine-10 (K10) and R9 fused to the negatively charged poly-glutamic acid-9 (E9) peptide (R9/E9) displayed minimal neuroprotection after excitotoxicity. These results indicate that peptide positive charge and arginine residues are critical for neuroprotection, and have led us to hypothesize that peptide-induced endocytic internalization of ion channels is a potential mechanism of action. The findings also question the mode of action of different neuroprotective peptides fused to arginine-rich CPPs.",

      "# Title: The R18 Polyarginine Peptide Is More Effective Than the TAT-NR2B9c (NA-1) Peptide When Administered 60 Minutes after Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in the Rat.\n# Abstract: We examined the dose responsiveness of polyarginine R18 (100, 300, and 1000 nmol/kg) when administered 60 minutes after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The TAT-NR2B9c peptide, which is known to be neuroprotective in rodent and nonhuman primate stroke models, served as a positive control. At 24 hours after MCAO, there was reduced total infarct volume in R18 treated animals at all doses, but this reduction only reached statistical significance at doses of 100 and 1000 nmol/kg. The TAT-NR2B9c peptide reduced infarct volume at doses of 300 and 1000 nmol/kg, but not to a statistically significant extent, while the 100 nmol/kg dose was ineffective. The reduction in infarct volume with R18 and TAT-NR2B9c peptide treatments was mirrored by improvements in one or more functional outcomes (namely, neurological score, adhesive tape removal, and rota-rod), but not to a statistically significant extent. These findings further confirm the neuroprotective properties of polyarginine peptides and for R18 extend its therapeutic time window and dose range, as well as demonstrating its greater efficacy compared to TAT-NR2B9c in a severe stroke model. The superior neuroprotective efficacy of R18 over TAT-NR2B9c highlights the potential of this polyarginine peptide as a lead candidate for studies in human stroke.",
      "# Title: Assessment of the Neuroprotective Effects of Arginine-Rich Protamine Peptides, Poly-Arginine Peptides (R12-Cyclic, R22) and Arginine-Tryptophan-Containing Peptides Following In Vitro Excitotoxicity and/or Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in Rats.\n# Abstract: We have demonstrated that arginine-rich and poly-arginine peptides possess potent neuroprotective properties with arginine content and peptide positive charge being particularly critical for neuroprotective efficacy. In addition, the presence of other amino acids within arginine-rich peptides, as well as chemical modifications, peptide length and cell-penetrating properties also influence the level of neuroprotection. Against this background, we have examined the neuroprotective efficacy of arginine-rich protamine peptides, a cyclic (R12-c) poly-arginine peptide and a R22 poly-arginine peptide, as well as arginine peptides containing tryptophan or other amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, glycine or leucine) in in vitro glutamic acid excitotoxicity and in vivo rat permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion models of stroke. In vitro studies demonstrated that protamine and poly-arginine peptides (R12-c, R22) were neuroprotective. Arginine-tryptophan-containing peptides were highly neuroprotective, with R12W8a being the most potent arginine-rich peptide identified in our laboratory. Peptides containing phenylalanine or tyrosine substituted in place of tryptophan in R12W8a were also highly neuroprotective, whereas leucine, and in particular glycine substitutions, decreased peptide efficacy. In vivo studies with protamine administered intravenously at 1000 nmol/kg 30 min after MCAO significantly reduced infarct volume and cerebral oedema by 22.5 and 38.6%, respectively. The R12W8a peptide was highly toxic when administered intravenously at 300 or 100 nmol/kg and ineffective at reducing infarct volume when administered at 30 nmol/kg 30 min after MCAO, unlike R18 (30 nmol/kg), which significantly reduced infarct volume by 20.4%. However, both R12W8a and R18 significantly reduced cerebral oedema by 19.8 and 42.2%, respectively. Protamine, R12W8a and R18 also reduced neuronal glutamic acid-induced calcium influx. These findings further highlight the neuroprotective properties of arginine-rich peptides and support the view that they represent a new class of neuroprotective agent.",
      "# Title: Delayed 2-h post-stroke administration of R18 and NA-1 (TAT-NR2B9c) peptides after permanent and/or transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat.\n# Abstract: Following positive results with the poly-arginine peptide R18 when administered intravenously 30 or 60min after permanent and/or transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO; 90min) in the rat, we examined the effectiveness of the peptide when administered 2h after MCAO. R18 was administered intravenously (1000nmol/kg via jugular vein) after permanent MCAO or a transient 3-h MCAO or when administered intra-arterially (100nmol/kg via internal carotid artery) immediately after reperfusion following a transient 2-h MCAO. In the transient MCAO studies, the neuroprotective NA-1 peptide was used as a positive control. Infarct volume, cerebral edema and functional outcomes were measured 24h after MCAO. Following permanent or transient MCAO, neither R18 nor NA-1 significantly reduced infarct volume. However, following permanent MCAO, R18 appeared to reduce cerebral edema (p=0.006), whereas following a transient 3-h MCAO, R18 improved the time to remove adhesive tape (p=0.04) without significantly affecting cerebral edema. There was also a trend (p=0.07) towards improved rota-rod performance with R18 in both permanent and transient 3-h MCAO. Following a transient 2-h MCAO, R18 had no significant effects on cerebral edema or neurological score but did lessen the extent of weight loss. Overall, while R18 had no effect on infarct volume, the peptide reduced cerebral edema after permanent MCAO, and improved some functional outcomes after transient MCAO.",
      "# Title: Warburg effect hypothesis in autism Spectrum disorders.\n# Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disease which is characterized by a deficit in social interactions and communication with repetitive and restrictive behavior. In altered cells, metabolic enzymes are modified by the dysregulation of the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway. In ASD, the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway is upregulated. We focus this review on the hypothesis of Warburg effect stimulated by the overexpression of the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway in ASD. Upregulation of WNT/β-catenin pathway induces aerobic glycolysis, named Warburg effect, through activation of glucose transporter (Glut), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1(PDK1), monocarboxylate lactate transporter 1 (MCT-1), lactate dehydrogenase kinase-A (LDH-A) and inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH). The aerobic glycolysis consists to a supply of a large part of glucose into lactate regardless of oxygen. Aerobic glycolysis is less efficient in terms of ATP production than oxidative phosphorylation because of the shunt of the TCA cycle. Dysregulation of energetic metabolism might promote cell deregulation and progression of ASD. Warburg effect regulation could be an attractive target for developing therapeutic interventions in ASD.",
      "# Title: Comparison of neuroprotective efficacy of poly-arginine R18 and R18D (D-enantiomer) peptides following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in the Wistar rat and in vitro toxicity studies.\n# Abstract: We have previously demonstrated that arginine-rich and poly-arginine peptides possess potent neuroprotective properties, with poly-arginine peptide R18 identified as being highly effective at reducing infarct volume following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the Sprague Dawley rat. Since peptides synthesised using D-isoform amino acids have greater stability than L-isoform peptides due to increased resistance to proteolytic degradation, they represent potentially more effective peptide therapeutics. Therefore we compared the neuroprotective efficacy of R18 and its D-enantiomer R18D following permanent MCAO in the Wistar rat. Furthermore, as increased peptide stability may also increase peptide toxicity, we examined the effects of R18 and R18D on cultured cortical neurons, astrocytes, brain endothelial cells (bEND.3), and embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) following a 10-minute or 24-hour peptide exposure duration. The in vivo studies demonstrated that R18D resulted in a greater reduction in mean infarct volume compared to R18 (33%, p = 0.004 vs 12%, p = 0.27) after intravenous administration at 300 nmol/kg 30 minutes after MCAO. Both R18D and R18 reduced cerebral hemisphere swelling to a comparable degree (27%, p = 0.03 and 30%, p = 0.02), and improved neurological assessment scores (1.5, p = 0.02 and 2, p = 0.058 vs 3 for vehicle). No abnormal histological findings specific to peptide treatments were observed in hematoxylin and eosin stained sections of kidney, liver, spleen, lung and heart. In vitro studies demonstrated that R18 and R18D were most toxic to neurons, followed by astrocytes, HEK293 and bEND.3 cells, but only at high concentrations and/or following 24-hour exposure. These findings further highlight the neuroprotective properties of poly-arginine peptides, and indicate that R18D at the dose examined is more potent than R18 in Wistar rats, and justify continued investigation of the R18 peptide as a novel neuroprotective agent for stroke.",
      "# Title: Assessment of therapeutic window for poly-arginine-18D (R18D) in a P7 rat model of perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy.\n# Abstract: Hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) remains the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in neonates, with no available neuroprotective therapeutic agent. In the development of a therapeutic for HIE, we examined the neuroprotective efficacy of the poly-arginine peptide R18D (arginine 18 mer synthesised with D-arginine) in a perinatal model of hypoxia-ischaemia (HI; common carotid and external carotid occlusion + 8%O2 /92%N2 for 2.5 hr) in the P7 Sprague-Dawley rat. R18D was administered intraperitoneally 30 min (doses 10, 30, 100, 300 and 1,000 nmol/kg), 60 min (doses 30 and 300 nmol/kg) or 120 min (doses 30 and 300 nmol/kg) after HI. Infarct volumes and behavioural outcomes were measured 48 hr after HI. When administered 30 min after HI, R18D at varying doses reduced infarct volume by 23.7% to 35.6% (p = 0.009 to < 0.0001) and resulted in improvements in the negative geotactic response and wire-hang times, at a dose of 30 nmol/kg. When administered 60 min after HI, R18D at the 30 nmol/kg dose reduced total infarct volume by 34.2% (p = 0.002), whilst the 300 nmol/kg dose improved wire-hang time. When administered 120 min after HI, R18D at the 30 and 300 nmol/kg doses had no significant impact on infarct volume, but the 300 nmol/kg dose improved the negative geotactic response. This study further confirms the neuroprotective properties of poly-arginine peptides, demonstrating that R18D can reduce infarct volume and improve behavioural outcomes after HI if administered up to 60 min after HI and improve behavioural outcomes up to 2 hr after HI.",
      "# Title: Poly-Arginine Peptides R18 and R18D Improve Functional Outcomes After Endothelin-1-Induced Stroke in the Sprague Dawley Rat.\n# Abstract: We have previously demonstrated that R18 and its d-enantiomer, R18D, are neuroprotective at 24 hours following intraluminal filament occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) in the rat. This study examined R18 and R18D effectiveness in improving functional outcomes at up to 56 days poststroke following endothelin-1-induced MCAO. Peptides were administered intravenously at doses of 100, 300, or 1000 nmol/kg, 60 minutes after MCAO. Functional recovery poststroke was assessed using multiple forelimb placing tests and horizontal ladder test, and NA-1 (TAT-NR2B9c), a neuroprotective currently in phase 3 clinical stroke trials, was used as a benchmark. The study demonstrated that R18 (300 and 1000 nmol/kg) was the most effective peptide in improving functional outcomes, followed by R18D (300 and 1000 nmol/kg), and NA-1 (300 and 100 nmol/kg). Furthermore, R18 at doses of 300 and 1000 nmol/kg was the most effective agent in restoring pre-stroke body weight, while R18 and R18D at doses of 300 and 1000 nmol/kg, but not NA-1 also significantly reduced the number of animals requiring hand feeding 48 hours after stroke. This study confirms that R18 and R18D are effective in improving long-term functional outcomes after stroke, and suggests that R18 may be more effective than NA-1.",
      "# Title: Comparative Assessment of the Proteolytic Stability and Impact of Poly-Arginine Peptides R18 and R18D on Infarct Growth and Penumbral Tissue Preservation Following Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in the Sprague Dawley Rat.\n# Abstract: Poly-arginine peptides R18 and R18D have previously been demonstrated to be neuroprotective in ischaemic stroke models. Here we examined the proteolytic stability and efficacy of R18 and R18D in reducing infarct core growth and preserving the ischaemic penumbra following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the Sprague Dawley rat. R18 (300 or 1000 nmol/kg), R18D (300 nmol/kg) or saline were administered intravenously 10 min after MCAO induced using a filament. Serial perfusion and diffusion-weighted MRI imaging was performed to measure changes in the infarct core and penumbra from time points between 45- and 225-min post-occlusion. Repeated measures analyses of infarct growth and penumbral tissue size were evaluated using generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs). R18D (300 nmol/kg) was most effective in slowing infarct core growth (46.8 mm3 reduction; p < 0.001) and preserving penumbral tissue (21.6% increase; p < 0.001), followed by R18 at the 300 nmol/kg dose (core: 29.5 mm3 reduction; p < 0.001, penumbra: 12.5% increase; p < 0.001). R18 at the 1000 nmol/kg dose had a significant impact in slowing core growth (19.5 mm3 reduction; p = 0.026), but only a modest impact on penumbral preservation (6.9% increase; p = 0.062). The in vitro anti-excitotoxic neuroprotective efficacy of R18D was also demonstrated to be unaffected when preincubated for 1-3 h or overnight, in a cell lysate prepared from dying neurons or with the proteolytic enzyme, plasmin, whereas the neuroprotective efficacy of R18 was significantly reduced after a 2-h incubation. These findings highlight the capacity of poly-arginine peptides to reduce infarct growth and preserve the ischaemic penumbra, and confirm the superior efficacy and proteolytic stability of R18D, which indicates that this peptide is likely to retain its neuroprotective properties when co-administered with alteplase during thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke."

A randomized, single-blind study was performed to evaluate the effects of the combination of high-dose furosemide and small-volume hypertonic saline solution (HSS) infusion in the treatment of refractory New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV CHF and a normosodic diet during follow-up. Materials and Methods One hundred seven patients (39 women and 68 men, age range 65-90 years) with refractory CHF (NYHA class IV) of different etiologies, who were unresponsive to high oral doses of furosemide, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digitalis, and nitrates, were enrolled. Inclusion criteria included an ejection fraction (EF) <35%, serum creatinine level <2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level < or =60 mg/dL, reduced urinary volume, and low natriuresis. The patients were randomized in 2 groups (single-blind). Patients in group 1 (20 women and 33 men) received an intravenous (IV) infusion of furosemide (500-1000 mg) plus HSS (150 mL of 1.4%-4.6% NACl) twice a day in 30 minutes. Patients in group 2 (19 women and 35 men) received an IV bolus of furosemide (500-1000 mg) twice a day, without HSS, during a period lasting 6 to 12 days. Both groups received IV KCl (20-40 mEq) to prevent hypokalemia. At study entry, all patients underwent a physical examination and measurement of body weight (BW), blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR), an evaluation of signs of CHF, and measurement of control levels of serum Na, K, Cl, bicarbonate, albumin, uric acid, creatinine, urea, and glycemia daily during hospitalization, and measurements of the daily output of urine for Na, K, and Cl. A chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram were obtained at study entry, during hospitalization, and at the time of discharge from the hospital. During the treatment and after discharge, the daily dietary Na intake was 120 mmol in group 1 versus 80 mmol in group 2, with a fluid intake of 1000 mL daily in both groups. An assessment of BW and 24-hour urinary volume, serum, and urinary laboratory parameters were performed daily until patients reached a compensated state, when IV furosemide was replaced with oral administration (250-500 mg/d). After discharge from the hospital, patients were observed as outpatients weekly for the first 3 months and, subsequently, once a month.",

Both groups had normal sodium (120 mmol sodium) intake. After discharge, the two groups continued to receive 120 mmol Na/day and 500-1000 mL water/day.The first group (132 C-HSS patients) had an increase in urination, a reduction in hospitalization time (4 ± 2 versus 7 ± 2 days, P < 0.01), and a reduction in hospitalization costs (2210 RMB versus 3506 RMB, P < 0.01) compared with the second group (132 without C-HSS patients). During the follow-up period (36 ± 12 months), the first group had a significantly higher average readmission time (31.84 ± 7.58 months versus 15.60 ± 6.25 months, P < 0.01) and lower mortality rate (16.5% versus 31.9%, P < 0.01).The results suggest that periodical C-HSS administration, combined with serious water restriction and a normal sodium diet, significantly reduces the hospitalization time, readmission rate, and mortality in patients with NYHA class III HF."

      "# Title: Serum Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2-binding protein for patients with chronic hepatitis B and C: a comparative study.\n# Abstract: We compared Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2-binding protein (WFA+ -M2BP) levels between patients with chronic hepatitis B (n=249) and chronic hepatitis C (n=386) based on the degree of liver fibrosis. We examined WFA+ -M2BP levels in patients with F4 (cirrhosis), F3 or more (advanced fibrosis) and F2 or more (significant fibrosis) in the two groups. We further examined the relationship between five fibrosis markers and the degree of fibrosis. The WFA+ -M2BP values ranged from 0.25 cut-off index (COI) to 12.9 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 0.34-20.0 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P<.0001). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F4 in the two groups were 2.83 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 5.03 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P=.0046). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F3 or more in the two groups were 1.79 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 3.79 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P<.0001). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F2 or more in the two groups were 1.49 COI in the hepatitis B cohort and 3.19 COI in the hepatitis C group (P<.0001). Among five liver fibrosis markers, WFA+ -M2BP had the highest correlation coefficient (rs =.629) in terms of correlation with the degree of fibrosis in the patients with hepatitis C and had the second highest rs value (.415) in the hepatitis B group. Although WFA+ -M2BP could be a useful indicator of liver fibrosis, WFA+ -M2BP levels in the two groups significantly differed even in the same degree of fibrosis. Individual cut-off values in each aetiology for the degree of fibrosis should be determined.",
      "# Title: Serum Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n# Abstract: Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein (WFA+-M2BP) has been suggested to be useful for the assessment of disease severity in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Consecutive adult NAFLD patients who had a liver biopsy were included. Serum WFA+-M2BP level was measured using a lectin-antibody sandwich immunoassay using a chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay machine (HISCL-5000, Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). The measured levels were indexed using the following equation: Cut-off index (COI) = ([WFA+-M2BP]sample-[WFA+-M2BP]NC) / ([WFA+-M2BP]PC-[WFA+-M2BP]NC), where PC = positive control and NC = negative control. Histopathological examination of liver biopsy specimen was reported according to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Clinical Research Network Scoring System. Data for 220 cases were analyzed. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of NASH was 0.65. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of steatosis grade ≥2 and 3 was 0.64 and 0.53, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of lobular inflammation grade ≥1, ≥2 and 3 was 0.57, 0.68 and 0.59, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of hepatocyte ballooning grade ≥1 and 2 was 0.64 and 0.65, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of fibrosis stage ≥1, ≥2, ≥3 and 4 was 0.61, 0.71, 0.74 and 0.84, respectively. Out of the 220 cases, 152 cases were the same 76 patients who had a repeat liver biopsy after 48 weeks of intervention. The AUROC of the change in the COI to detect improvement in steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning and fibrosis was 0.57, 0.54, 0.59 and 0.52, respectively. In conclusion, serum WFA+-M2BP was most useful for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in NAFLD patients. However, it was less useful for differentiating NASH from non-NASH, and for diagnosis and follow-up of the individual histopathological components of NASH.",
      "# Title: Serum Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2-binding protein expression predicts disease severity in chronic hepatitis C patients.\n# Abstract: Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein (WFA+-M2BP) has recently been developed as a promising liver fibrosis glyco biomarker. We assessed its efficacy in evaluating liver disease severity in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in Taiwan. The association between WFA+-M2BP and histological features was evaluated among those CHC patients underwent liver biopsy. We also aimed to clarify the factors determining the performance of WFA+-M2BP in CHC. A total of 229 CHC patients were consecutively recruited. The mean value of WFA+-M2BP in patients from F0 to F4 was 1.68, 2.23, 3.45, 3.48, 3.77 respectively (linear trend P = 0.008). Linear regression analysis revealed that alanine aminotransferase (odds ratio [OR]: 0.03, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.02-0.05, P < 0.001), AST (OR: -0.1, 95% CI: -0.02 to -0.01, P < 0.001), and liver fibrosis (OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.01-0.59, P = 0.043) were the independent factors correlated to serum WFA+-M2BP level. The optimal cutoff values of WFA+-M2BP for fibrosis stages F1, F2, F3, and F4 were 1.42, 1.61, 1.42, and 2.67, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the platelet count (OR/CI: -0.009/0.986-0.996, P = <0.001), r-glutamyl transferase (OR/CI: 0.007/1.000-1.013, P = 0.036), and WFA+-M2BP (OR/CI: 0.187/1.057-1.374, P = 0.005). We concluded that WFA+-M2BP is a competent noninvasive marker for liver fibrosis assessment in CHC patients.",

      "# Title: Comparison of serum fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B.\n# Abstract: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The diagnosis of liver fibrosis has a key role in selecting patients with CHB for antiviral treatment. However, serum biomarkers demonstrate limited diagnostic utility. The present study aimed to compare the performances of fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB and to identify the most appropriate biomarker for these patients. The current study included 96 antiviral-naïve patients with CHB who underwent liver biopsy. METAVIR scoring system was used to assess liver fibrosis and necroinflammation. The diagnostic performances were evaluated of the platelet (PLT) count; the levels of hyaluronan, serum 7S domain of type 4 collagen, procollagen type III N-terminal peptide, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1, Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) and N-terminal type III collagen propeptide (Pro-C3); the fibrosis index based on four factors; the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index; and enhanced liver fibrosis score for identifying significant liver fibrosis [≥fibrosis stage 2 (F2)]. All fibrosis biomarkers, except the Pro-C3 level, correlated with the fibrosis stage. M2BPGi was better than other biomarkers for diagnosing ≥F2, with the highest area under the curve of 0.902. M2BPGi demonstrated a higher diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis than mild/severe fibrosis or cirrhosis. However, no significant correlation was observed between the M2BPGi level and fibrosis stage in patients with CHB having significant liver necroinflammation defined as ≥ necroinflammatory activity 2. The M2BPGi level and PLT count were exclusively correlated with the fibrosis stage in 73 patients without significant liver necroinflammation. M2BPGi demonstrated the highest diagnostic performance for significant fibrosis in patients having significant liver fibrosis with no significant liver necroinflammation. In conclusion, the M2BPGi level can accurately diagnose significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB.",

      "# Title: Serum Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2-binding protein expression predicts disease severity in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients.\n# Abstract: The role of Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein (WFA+ -M2BP) in the prediction of disease severity in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains elusive. This study evaluated the performance of WFA+ -M2BP in predicting fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. A total of 80 patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) were enrolled. Serum WFA+ -M2BP levels were measured using standard methods. The fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index was also measured. The mean values of WFA+ -M2BP were 1.0, 1.0, 0.8, and 2.2 in Metavir fibrosis stage F0, F1, F2, and F3-4, respectively (linear trend p = 0.005). The optimal cut-off value of WFA+ -M2BP in predicting advanced fibrosis (F3-4) was 1.37 cut-off index (COI), yielding the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, and accuracy of 75.0, 79.4, 39.1, 94.7, and 78.7%, respectively (p < 0.001). Combining WFA+ -M2BP with FIB-4 significantly increased the diagnostic performance for advanced fibrosis, yielding specificity, PPV, and accuracy of 100, 100, and 93%, respectively. The significant factors predicting advanced liver fibrosis in the multivariate regression analysis were WFA+ -M2BP ≥ 1.37 COI (OR/confidence interval [CI]: 9.49/1.63-55.21, p = 0.01) and FIB-4 ≥ 2.80 (OR/CI: 38.18/4.89-297.93, p = 0.001). Monitoring WFA+ -M2BP is suitable for noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis in NASH patients, particularly in combination with FIB-4."

    "referenceConclusion": "Moderate level of evidence demonstrated that both R18 and R18D administration can significantly improve stroke outcomes in animal stroke models. However, considering the limitations, further pre‐clinical and clinical studies are warranted to substantiate the neuroprotective efficacy of polyarginines for stroke. The present study results showed promising effects regarding the efficacy of administering polyarginines of R18 and R18D in improving functional status and neurological outcomes and decreasing infarct size following the induction of stroke in rats. Moreover, R18 effectively reduced brain edema in animal models of stroke. All of the mentioned effects were supported by a moderate level of evidence. However, while these results are subjected to certain limitations, the pre‐clinical data are highly encouraging and provide the support for the translation of polyarginine peptides as possible clinical stroke therapeutics.",

      "# Title: Therapeutic effects of a reducible poly (oligo-D-arginine) carrier with the heme oxygenase-1 gene in the treatment of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.\n# Abstract: Non-viral carriers for gene therapy have been developed to minimize carrier cytotoxicity and to enhance transfection efficiency. Previously, we synthesized a 9-arginine-based reducible high molecular weight peptide for gene delivery. For the reducible poly(oligo-D-arginines) (rPOA), 9-arginine oligopeptides are connected by internal disulfide linkages to produce a high molecular weight peptide. In this study, rPOA was evaluated as a carrier of the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene for the treatment of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) -induced brain stroke. An in vitro transfection assay showed that rPOA had higher transfection efficiency and lower toxicity than polyethylenimine (PEI). For in vivo evaluation, I/R rat models were produced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). rPOA/HO-1 expression plasmid (pHO-1) polyplexes were injected into the brain at 1 h before MCAO, and HO-1 expression levels in the brain were then measured by ELISA. The results indicated that rPOA/pHO-1 polyplexes had higher transfection efficiencies than PEI/pHO-1 polyplexes. The rPOA/pHO-1 polyplexes significantly reduced infarct volumes. In addition, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) was reduced in the rPOA/pHO-1 polyplex injection group, suggesting that HO-1 had an anti-inflammatory effect, while the PEI/pHO-1 polyplex did not show this effect. These results suggest that rPOA is a potential non-viral vector for HO-1 gene therapy to protect brain cells from I/R-related neuronal injury including stroke.",
      "# Title: Poly-arginine and arginine-rich peptides are neuroprotective in stroke models.\n# Abstract: Using cortical neuronal cultures and glutamic acid excitotoxicity and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) stroke models, we demonstrated that poly-arginine and arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), are highly neuroprotective, with efficacy increasing with increasing arginine content, have the capacity to reduce glutamic acid-induced neuronal calcium influx and require heparan sulfate preotoglycan-mediated endocytosis to induce a neuroprotective effect. Furthermore, neuroprotection could be induced with immediate peptide treatment or treatment up to 2 to 4 hours before glutamic acid excitotoxicity or OGD, and with poly-arginine-9 (R9) when administered intravenously after stroke onset in a rat model. In contrast, the JNKI-1 peptide when fused to the (non-arginine) kFGF CPP, which does not rely on endocytosis for uptake, was not neuroprotective in the glutamic acid model; the kFGF peptide was also ineffective. Similarly, positively charged poly-lysine-10 (K10) and R9 fused to the negatively charged poly-glutamic acid-9 (E9) peptide (R9/E9) displayed minimal neuroprotection after excitotoxicity. These results indicate that peptide positive charge and arginine residues are critical for neuroprotection, and have led us to hypothesize that peptide-induced endocytic internalization of ion channels is a potential mechanism of action. The findings also question the mode of action of different neuroprotective peptides fused to arginine-rich CPPs.",

      "# Title: The R18 Polyarginine Peptide Is More Effective Than the TAT-NR2B9c (NA-1) Peptide When Administered 60 Minutes after Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in the Rat.\n# Abstract: We examined the dose responsiveness of polyarginine R18 (100, 300, and 1000 nmol/kg) when administered 60 minutes after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The TAT-NR2B9c peptide, which is known to be neuroprotective in rodent and nonhuman primate stroke models, served as a positive control. At 24 hours after MCAO, there was reduced total infarct volume in R18 treated animals at all doses, but this reduction only reached statistical significance at doses of 100 and 1000 nmol/kg. The TAT-NR2B9c peptide reduced infarct volume at doses of 300 and 1000 nmol/kg, but not to a statistically significant extent, while the 100 nmol/kg dose was ineffective. The reduction in infarct volume with R18 and TAT-NR2B9c peptide treatments was mirrored by improvements in one or more functional outcomes (namely, neurological score, adhesive tape removal, and rota-rod), but not to a statistically significant extent. These findings further confirm the neuroprotective properties of polyarginine peptides and for R18 extend its therapeutic time window and dose range, as well as demonstrating its greater efficacy compared to TAT-NR2B9c in a severe stroke model. The superior neuroprotective efficacy of R18 over TAT-NR2B9c highlights the potential of this polyarginine peptide as a lead candidate for studies in human stroke.",
      "# Title: Assessment of the Neuroprotective Effects of Arginine-Rich Protamine Peptides, Poly-Arginine Peptides (R12-Cyclic, R22) and Arginine-Tryptophan-Containing Peptides Following In Vitro Excitotoxicity and/or Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in Rats.\n# Abstract: We have demonstrated that arginine-rich and poly-arginine peptides possess potent neuroprotective properties with arginine content and peptide positive charge being particularly critical for neuroprotective efficacy. In addition, the presence of other amino acids within arginine-rich peptides, as well as chemical modifications, peptide length and cell-penetrating properties also influence the level of neuroprotection. Against this background, we have examined the neuroprotective efficacy of arginine-rich protamine peptides, a cyclic (R12-c) poly-arginine peptide and a R22 poly-arginine peptide, as well as arginine peptides containing tryptophan or other amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, glycine or leucine) in in vitro glutamic acid excitotoxicity and in vivo rat permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion models of stroke. In vitro studies demonstrated that protamine and poly-arginine peptides (R12-c, R22) were neuroprotective. Arginine-tryptophan-containing peptides were highly neuroprotective, with R12W8a being the most potent arginine-rich peptide identified in our laboratory. Peptides containing phenylalanine or tyrosine substituted in place of tryptophan in R12W8a were also highly neuroprotective, whereas leucine, and in particular glycine substitutions, decreased peptide efficacy. In vivo studies with protamine administered intravenously at 1000 nmol/kg 30 min after MCAO significantly reduced infarct volume and cerebral oedema by 22.5 and 38.6%, respectively. The R12W8a peptide was highly toxic when administered intravenously at 300 or 100 nmol/kg and ineffective at reducing infarct volume when administered at 30 nmol/kg 30 min after MCAO, unlike R18 (30 nmol/kg), which significantly reduced infarct volume by 20.4%. However, both R12W8a and R18 significantly reduced cerebral oedema by 19.8 and 42.2%, respectively. Protamine, R12W8a and R18 also reduced neuronal glutamic acid-induced calcium influx. These findings further highlight the neuroprotective properties of arginine-rich peptides and support the view that they represent a new class of neuroprotective agent.",
      "# Title: Delayed 2-h post-stroke administration of R18 and NA-1 (TAT-NR2B9c) peptides after permanent and/or transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat.\n# Abstract: Following positive results with the poly-arginine peptide R18 when administered intravenously 30 or 60min after permanent and/or transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO; 90min) in the rat, we examined the effectiveness of the peptide when administered 2h after MCAO. R18 was administered intravenously (1000nmol/kg via jugular vein) after permanent MCAO or a transient 3-h MCAO or when administered intra-arterially (100nmol/kg via internal carotid artery) immediately after reperfusion following a transient 2-h MCAO. In the transient MCAO studies, the neuroprotective NA-1 peptide was used as a positive control. Infarct volume, cerebral edema and functional outcomes were measured 24h after MCAO. Following permanent or transient MCAO, neither R18 nor NA-1 significantly reduced infarct volume. However, following permanent MCAO, R18 appeared to reduce cerebral edema (p=0.006), whereas following a transient 3-h MCAO, R18 improved the time to remove adhesive tape (p=0.04) without significantly affecting cerebral edema. There was also a trend (p=0.07) towards improved rota-rod performance with R18 in both permanent and transient 3-h MCAO. Following a transient 2-h MCAO, R18 had no significant effects on cerebral edema or neurological score but did lessen the extent of weight loss. Overall, while R18 had no effect on infarct volume, the peptide reduced cerebral edema after permanent MCAO, and improved some functional outcomes after transient MCAO.",
      "# Title: Warburg effect hypothesis in autism Spectrum disorders.\n# Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disease which is characterized by a deficit in social interactions and communication with repetitive and restrictive behavior. In altered cells, metabolic enzymes are modified by the dysregulation of the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway. In ASD, the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway is upregulated. We focus this review on the hypothesis of Warburg effect stimulated by the overexpression of the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway in ASD. Upregulation of WNT/β-catenin pathway induces aerobic glycolysis, named Warburg effect, through activation of glucose transporter (Glut), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1(PDK1), monocarboxylate lactate transporter 1 (MCT-1), lactate dehydrogenase kinase-A (LDH-A) and inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH). The aerobic glycolysis consists to a supply of a large part of glucose into lactate regardless of oxygen. Aerobic glycolysis is less efficient in terms of ATP production than oxidative phosphorylation because of the shunt of the TCA cycle. Dysregulation of energetic metabolism might promote cell deregulation and progression of ASD. Warburg effect regulation could be an attractive target for developing therapeutic interventions in ASD.",
      "# Title: Comparison of neuroprotective efficacy of poly-arginine R18 and R18D (D-enantiomer) peptides following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in the Wistar rat and in vitro toxicity studies.\n# Abstract: We have previously demonstrated that arginine-rich and poly-arginine peptides possess potent neuroprotective properties, with poly-arginine peptide R18 identified as being highly effective at reducing infarct volume following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the Sprague Dawley rat. Since peptides synthesised using D-isoform amino acids have greater stability than L-isoform peptides due to increased resistance to proteolytic degradation, they represent potentially more effective peptide therapeutics. Therefore we compared the neuroprotective efficacy of R18 and its D-enantiomer R18D following permanent MCAO in the Wistar rat. Furthermore, as increased peptide stability may also increase peptide toxicity, we examined the effects of R18 and R18D on cultured cortical neurons, astrocytes, brain endothelial cells (bEND.3), and embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) following a 10-minute or 24-hour peptide exposure duration. The in vivo studies demonstrated that R18D resulted in a greater reduction in mean infarct volume compared to R18 (33%, p = 0.004 vs 12%, p = 0.27) after intravenous administration at 300 nmol/kg 30 minutes after MCAO. Both R18D and R18 reduced cerebral hemisphere swelling to a comparable degree (27%, p = 0.03 and 30%, p = 0.02), and improved neurological assessment scores (1.5, p = 0.02 and 2, p = 0.058 vs 3 for vehicle). No abnormal histological findings specific to peptide treatments were observed in hematoxylin and eosin stained sections of kidney, liver, spleen, lung and heart. In vitro studies demonstrated that R18 and R18D were most toxic to neurons, followed by astrocytes, HEK293 and bEND.3 cells, but only at high concentrations and/or following 24-hour exposure. These findings further highlight the neuroprotective properties of poly-arginine peptides, and indicate that R18D at the dose examined is more potent than R18 in Wistar rats, and justify continued investigation of the R18 peptide as a novel neuroprotective agent for stroke.",
      "# Title: Assessment of therapeutic window for poly-arginine-18D (R18D) in a P7 rat model of perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy.\n# Abstract: Hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) remains the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in neonates, with no available neuroprotective therapeutic agent. In the development of a therapeutic for HIE, we examined the neuroprotective efficacy of the poly-arginine peptide R18D (arginine 18 mer synthesised with D-arginine) in a perinatal model of hypoxia-ischaemia (HI; common carotid and external carotid occlusion + 8%O2 /92%N2 for 2.5 hr) in the P7 Sprague-Dawley rat. R18D was administered intraperitoneally 30 min (doses 10, 30, 100, 300 and 1,000 nmol/kg), 60 min (doses 30 and 300 nmol/kg) or 120 min (doses 30 and 300 nmol/kg) after HI. Infarct volumes and behavioural outcomes were measured 48 hr after HI. When administered 30 min after HI, R18D at varying doses reduced infarct volume by 23.7% to 35.6% (p = 0.009 to < 0.0001) and resulted in improvements in the negative geotactic response and wire-hang times, at a dose of 30 nmol/kg. When administered 60 min after HI, R18D at the 30 nmol/kg dose reduced total infarct volume by 34.2% (p = 0.002), whilst the 300 nmol/kg dose improved wire-hang time. When administered 120 min after HI, R18D at the 30 and 300 nmol/kg doses had no significant impact on infarct volume, but the 300 nmol/kg dose improved the negative geotactic response. This study further confirms the neuroprotective properties of poly-arginine peptides, demonstrating that R18D can reduce infarct volume and improve behavioural outcomes after HI if administered up to 60 min after HI and improve behavioural outcomes up to 2 hr after HI.",
      "# Title: Poly-Arginine Peptides R18 and R18D Improve Functional Outcomes After Endothelin-1-Induced Stroke in the Sprague Dawley Rat.\n# Abstract: We have previously demonstrated that R18 and its d-enantiomer, R18D, are neuroprotective at 24 hours following intraluminal filament occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) in the rat. This study examined R18 and R18D effectiveness in improving functional outcomes at up to 56 days poststroke following endothelin-1-induced MCAO. Peptides were administered intravenously at doses of 100, 300, or 1000 nmol/kg, 60 minutes after MCAO. Functional recovery poststroke was assessed using multiple forelimb placing tests and horizontal ladder test, and NA-1 (TAT-NR2B9c), a neuroprotective currently in phase 3 clinical stroke trials, was used as a benchmark. The study demonstrated that R18 (300 and 1000 nmol/kg) was the most effective peptide in improving functional outcomes, followed by R18D (300 and 1000 nmol/kg), and NA-1 (300 and 100 nmol/kg). Furthermore, R18 at doses of 300 and 1000 nmol/kg was the most effective agent in restoring pre-stroke body weight, while R18 and R18D at doses of 300 and 1000 nmol/kg, but not NA-1 also significantly reduced the number of animals requiring hand feeding 48 hours after stroke. This study confirms that R18 and R18D are effective in improving long-term functional outcomes after stroke, and suggests that R18 may be more effective than NA-1.",
      "# Title: Comparative Assessment of the Proteolytic Stability and Impact of Poly-Arginine Peptides R18 and R18D on Infarct Growth and Penumbral Tissue Preservation Following Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in the Sprague Dawley Rat.\n# Abstract: Poly-arginine peptides R18 and R18D have previously been demonstrated to be neuroprotective in ischaemic stroke models. Here we examined the proteolytic stability and efficacy of R18 and R18D in reducing infarct core growth and preserving the ischaemic penumbra following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the Sprague Dawley rat. R18 (300 or 1000 nmol/kg), R18D (300 nmol/kg) or saline were administered intravenously 10 min after MCAO induced using a filament. Serial perfusion and diffusion-weighted MRI imaging was performed to measure changes in the infarct core and penumbra from time points between 45- and 225-min post-occlusion. Repeated measures analyses of infarct growth and penumbral tissue size were evaluated using generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs). R18D (300 nmol/kg) was most effective in slowing infarct core growth (46.8 mm3 reduction; p < 0.001) and preserving penumbral tissue (21.6% increase; p < 0.001), followed by R18 at the 300 nmol/kg dose (core: 29.5 mm3 reduction; p < 0.001, penumbra: 12.5% increase; p < 0.001). R18 at the 1000 nmol/kg dose had a significant impact in slowing core growth (19.5 mm3 reduction; p = 0.026), but only a modest impact on penumbral preservation (6.9% increase; p = 0.062). The in vitro anti-excitotoxic neuroprotective efficacy of R18D was also demonstrated to be unaffected when preincubated for 1-3 h or overnight, in a cell lysate prepared from dying neurons or with the proteolytic enzyme, plasmin, whereas the neuroprotective efficacy of R18 was significantly reduced after a 2-h incubation. These findings highlight the capacity of poly-arginine peptides to reduce infarct growth and preserve the ischaemic penumbra, and confirm the superior efficacy and proteolytic stability of R18D, which indicates that this peptide is likely to retain its neuroprotective properties when co-administered with alteplase during thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke."

Although current data intimate a potential contributory role for biofilms, these assertions remain uncorroborated. This observed data scarcity necessitates further targeted, rigorous scientific inquiry to either validate or refute the role of biofilms in the complex etiological framework of BIA-ALCL. Such forthcoming research could serve as a critical juncture in not only clarifying this enigmatic relationship but also in advancing our collective understanding of the disease, with implications for enhanced screening protocols and pre-surgical guidelines. Given the inconclusive nature of extant findings, further empirical scrutiny is both warranted and exigent. Given the current data limitations and inconclusive findings, continued exploration is both imperative and timely.",

      "# Title: Cytological diagnostic features of late breast implant seromas: From reactive to anaplastic large cell lymphoma.\n# Abstract: Late breast implant seroma may be the presentation of a breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BI-ALCL), which claims for a prompt recognition. However, BI-ALCL diagnosis on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) might be challenging for pathologists lacking experience with peri-implant breast effusions. Sixty-seven late breast implant seromas collected by FNA from 50 patients were evaluated by Papanicolaou smear stain and immunocytochemistry on cell blocks. A diagnostic algorithm based on the cellular composition, cell morphology and percentage of CD30+ cells was developed. Histological evaluation of the corresponding peri-prosthetic capsules was also performed. Most of the effusions (91% of the samples) were classified as reactive and 9% as BI-ALCL. In the BI-ALCL cases, medium-to-large atypical cells expressing CD30 represented more than 70% of the cellularity, whereas in in the reactive effusions CD30+ elements were extremely rare (<5%) and consisted of non-atypical elements. The reactive effusions were categorized into three patterns: i) acute infiltrate with prominent neutrophilic component (33% of the samples); ii) mixed infiltrate characterized by a variable number of neutrophils, lymphocytes and macrophages (30% of the samples); iii) chronic infiltrate composed predominantly of T lymphocytes or macrophages with only sporadic granulocytes (37% of the samples). The inflammatory cytological patterns were consistent with the histology of the corresponding capsules. Our results indicate that cytological analysis of late breast implant effusions, supported by the knowledge of the heterogeneous cytomorphological spectrum of late seromas, is a valuable approach for the early recognition of BI-ALCL.",

Its etiology unknown, one hypothesis suggests an initiating inflammatory stimulus, possibly infectious, triggers BIA-ALCL. We analyzed microbiota of breast, skin, implant and capsule in BIA-ALCL patients (n = 7), and controls via culturing methods, 16S rRNA microbiome sequencing, and immunohistochemistry. Alpha and beta diversity metrics and relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria were calculated, and phylogenetic trees constructed. Staphylococcus spp., the most commonly cultured microbes, were identified in both the BIA-ALCL and contralateral control breast. The diversity of bacterial microbiota did not differ significantly between BIA-ALCL and controls for any material analyzed. Further, there were no significant differences in the relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria between BIA-ALCL and control specimens. Heat maps suggested substantial diversity in the composition of the bacterial microbiota of the skin, breast, implant and capsule between patients with no clear trend to distinguish BIA-ALCL from controls. While we identified no consistent differences between patients with BIA-ALCL-affected and contralateral control breasts, this study provides insights into the composition of the breast microbiota in this population.",

      "# Title: Gram-Negative Bacterial Lipopolysaccharide Promotes Tumor Cell Proliferation in Breast Implant-Associated Anaplastic Large-Cell Lymphoma.\n# Abstract: Breast implant-associated anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) is a distinct malignancy associated with textured breast implants. We investigated whether bacteria could trigger the activation and multiplication of BIA-ALCL cells in vitro. BIA-ALCL patient-derived BIA-ALCL tumor cells, BIA-ALCL cell lines, cutaneous ALCL cell lines, an immortal T-cell line (MT-4), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from BIA-ALCL, capsular contracture, and primary augmentation patients were studied. Cells were subjected to various mitogenic stimulation assays including plant phytohemagglutinin (PHA), Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Staphylococcal superantigens enterotoxin A (SEA), toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), or sterilized implant shells. Patient-derived BIA-ALCL tumor cells and BIA-ALCL cell lines showed a unique response to LPS stimulation. This response was dampened significantly in the presence of a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) inhibitor peptide. In contrast, cutaneous ALCL cells, MT-4, and PBMC cells from all patients responded significantly more to PHA, SEA, and TSST-1 than to LPS. Breast implant shells of all surface grades alone did not produce a proliferative response of BIA-ALCL cells, indicating the breast implant does not act as a pro-inflammatory stimulant. These findings indicate a possible novel pathway for LPS to promote BIA-ALCL cell proliferation via a TLR4 receptor-mediated bacterial transformation of T-cells into malignancy."

Moreover, R18 effectively reduced brain edema in animal models of stroke. All of the mentioned effects were supported by a moderate level of evidence.

      "# Title: Therapeutic effects of a reducible poly (oligo-D-arginine) carrier with the heme oxygenase-1 gene in the treatment of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.\n# Abstract: Non-viral carriers for gene therapy have been developed to minimize carrier cytotoxicity and to enhance transfection efficiency. Previously, we synthesized a 9-arginine-based reducible high molecular weight peptide for gene delivery. For the reducible poly(oligo-D-arginines) (rPOA), 9-arginine oligopeptides are connected by internal disulfide linkages to produce a high molecular weight peptide. In this study, rPOA was evaluated as a carrier of the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene for the treatment of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) -induced brain stroke. An in vitro transfection assay showed that rPOA had higher transfection efficiency and lower toxicity than polyethylenimine (PEI). For in vivo evaluation, I/R rat models were produced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). rPOA/HO-1 expression plasmid (pHO-1) polyplexes were injected into the brain at 1 h before MCAO, and HO-1 expression levels in the brain were then measured by ELISA. The results indicated that rPOA/pHO-1 polyplexes had higher transfection efficiencies than PEI/pHO-1 polyplexes. The rPOA/pHO-1 polyplexes significantly reduced infarct volumes. In addition, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) was reduced in the rPOA/pHO-1 polyplex injection group, suggesting that HO-1 had an anti-inflammatory effect, while the PEI/pHO-1 polyplex did not show this effect. These results suggest that rPOA is a potential non-viral vector for HO-1 gene therapy to protect brain cells from I/R-related neuronal injury including stroke.",
      "# Title: Poly-arginine and arginine-rich peptides are neuroprotective in stroke models.\n# Abstract: Using cortical neuronal cultures and glutamic acid excitotoxicity and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) stroke models, we demonstrated that poly-arginine and arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), are highly neuroprotective, with efficacy increasing with increasing arginine content, have the capacity to reduce glutamic acid-induced neuronal calcium influx and require heparan sulfate preotoglycan-mediated endocytosis to induce a neuroprotective effect. Furthermore, neuroprotection could be induced with immediate peptide treatment or treatment up to 2 to 4 hours before glutamic acid excitotoxicity or OGD, and with poly-arginine-9 (R9) when administered intravenously after stroke onset in a rat model. In contrast, the JNKI-1 peptide when fused to the (non-arginine) kFGF CPP, which does not rely on endocytosis for uptake, was not neuroprotective in the glutamic acid model; the kFGF peptide was also ineffective. Similarly, positively charged poly-lysine-10 (K10) and R9 fused to the negatively charged poly-glutamic acid-9 (E9) peptide (R9/E9) displayed minimal neuroprotection after excitotoxicity. These results indicate that peptide positive charge and arginine residues are critical for neuroprotection, and have led us to hypothesize that peptide-induced endocytic internalization of ion channels is a potential mechanism of action. The findings also question the mode of action of different neuroprotective peptides fused to arginine-rich CPPs.",

      "# Title: The R18 Polyarginine Peptide Is More Effective Than the TAT-NR2B9c (NA-1) Peptide When Administered 60 Minutes after Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in the Rat.\n# Abstract: We examined the dose responsiveness of polyarginine R18 (100, 300, and 1000 nmol/kg) when administered 60 minutes after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The TAT-NR2B9c peptide, which is known to be neuroprotective in rodent and nonhuman primate stroke models, served as a positive control. At 24 hours after MCAO, there was reduced total infarct volume in R18 treated animals at all doses, but this reduction only reached statistical significance at doses of 100 and 1000 nmol/kg. The TAT-NR2B9c peptide reduced infarct volume at doses of 300 and 1000 nmol/kg, but not to a statistically significant extent, while the 100 nmol/kg dose was ineffective. The reduction in infarct volume with R18 and TAT-NR2B9c peptide treatments was mirrored by improvements in one or more functional outcomes (namely, neurological score, adhesive tape removal, and rota-rod), but not to a statistically significant extent. These findings further confirm the neuroprotective properties of polyarginine peptides and for R18 extend its therapeutic time window and dose range, as well as demonstrating its greater efficacy compared to TAT-NR2B9c in a severe stroke model. The superior neuroprotective efficacy of R18 over TAT-NR2B9c highlights the potential of this polyarginine peptide as a lead candidate for studies in human stroke.",
      "# Title: Assessment of the Neuroprotective Effects of Arginine-Rich Protamine Peptides, Poly-Arginine Peptides (R12-Cyclic, R22) and Arginine-Tryptophan-Containing Peptides Following In Vitro Excitotoxicity and/or Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in Rats.\n# Abstract: We have demonstrated that arginine-rich and poly-arginine peptides possess potent neuroprotective properties with arginine content and peptide positive charge being particularly critical for neuroprotective efficacy. In addition, the presence of other amino acids within arginine-rich peptides, as well as chemical modifications, peptide length and cell-penetrating properties also influence the level of neuroprotection. Against this background, we have examined the neuroprotective efficacy of arginine-rich protamine peptides, a cyclic (R12-c) poly-arginine peptide and a R22 poly-arginine peptide, as well as arginine peptides containing tryptophan or other amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, glycine or leucine) in in vitro glutamic acid excitotoxicity and in vivo rat permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion models of stroke. In vitro studies demonstrated that protamine and poly-arginine peptides (R12-c, R22) were neuroprotective. Arginine-tryptophan-containing peptides were highly neuroprotective, with R12W8a being the most potent arginine-rich peptide identified in our laboratory. Peptides containing phenylalanine or tyrosine substituted in place of tryptophan in R12W8a were also highly neuroprotective, whereas leucine, and in particular glycine substitutions, decreased peptide efficacy. In vivo studies with protamine administered intravenously at 1000 nmol/kg 30 min after MCAO significantly reduced infarct volume and cerebral oedema by 22.5 and 38.6%, respectively. The R12W8a peptide was highly toxic when administered intravenously at 300 or 100 nmol/kg and ineffective at reducing infarct volume when administered at 30 nmol/kg 30 min after MCAO, unlike R18 (30 nmol/kg), which significantly reduced infarct volume by 20.4%. However, both R12W8a and R18 significantly reduced cerebral oedema by 19.8 and 42.2%, respectively. Protamine, R12W8a and R18 also reduced neuronal glutamic acid-induced calcium influx. These findings further highlight the neuroprotective properties of arginine-rich peptides and support the view that they represent a new class of neuroprotective agent.",
      "# Title: Delayed 2-h post-stroke administration of R18 and NA-1 (TAT-NR2B9c) peptides after permanent and/or transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat.\n# Abstract: Following positive results with the poly-arginine peptide R18 when administered intravenously 30 or 60min after permanent and/or transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO; 90min) in the rat, we examined the effectiveness of the peptide when administered 2h after MCAO. R18 was administered intravenously (1000nmol/kg via jugular vein) after permanent MCAO or a transient 3-h MCAO or when administered intra-arterially (100nmol/kg via internal carotid artery) immediately after reperfusion following a transient 2-h MCAO. In the transient MCAO studies, the neuroprotective NA-1 peptide was used as a positive control. Infarct volume, cerebral edema and functional outcomes were measured 24h after MCAO. Following permanent or transient MCAO, neither R18 nor NA-1 significantly reduced infarct volume. However, following permanent MCAO, R18 appeared to reduce cerebral edema (p=0.006), whereas following a transient 3-h MCAO, R18 improved the time to remove adhesive tape (p=0.04) without significantly affecting cerebral edema. There was also a trend (p=0.07) towards improved rota-rod performance with R18 in both permanent and transient 3-h MCAO. Following a transient 2-h MCAO, R18 had no significant effects on cerebral edema or neurological score but did lessen the extent of weight loss. Overall, while R18 had no effect on infarct volume, the peptide reduced cerebral edema after permanent MCAO, and improved some functional outcomes after transient MCAO.",
      "# Title: Warburg effect hypothesis in autism Spectrum disorders.\n# Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disease which is characterized by a deficit in social interactions and communication with repetitive and restrictive behavior. In altered cells, metabolic enzymes are modified by the dysregulation of the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway. In ASD, the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway is upregulated. We focus this review on the hypothesis of Warburg effect stimulated by the overexpression of the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway in ASD. Upregulation of WNT/β-catenin pathway induces aerobic glycolysis, named Warburg effect, through activation of glucose transporter (Glut), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1(PDK1), monocarboxylate lactate transporter 1 (MCT-1), lactate dehydrogenase kinase-A (LDH-A) and inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH). The aerobic glycolysis consists to a supply of a large part of glucose into lactate regardless of oxygen. Aerobic glycolysis is less efficient in terms of ATP production than oxidative phosphorylation because of the shunt of the TCA cycle. Dysregulation of energetic metabolism might promote cell deregulation and progression of ASD. Warburg effect regulation could be an attractive target for developing therapeutic interventions in ASD.",
      "# Title: Comparison of neuroprotective efficacy of poly-arginine R18 and R18D (D-enantiomer) peptides following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in the Wistar rat and in vitro toxicity studies.\n# Abstract: We have previously demonstrated that arginine-rich and poly-arginine peptides possess potent neuroprotective properties, with poly-arginine peptide R18 identified as being highly effective at reducing infarct volume following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the Sprague Dawley rat. Since peptides synthesised using D-isoform amino acids have greater stability than L-isoform peptides due to increased resistance to proteolytic degradation, they represent potentially more effective peptide therapeutics. Therefore we compared the neuroprotective efficacy of R18 and its D-enantiomer R18D following permanent MCAO in the Wistar rat. Furthermore, as increased peptide stability may also increase peptide toxicity, we examined the effects of R18 and R18D on cultured cortical neurons, astrocytes, brain endothelial cells (bEND.3), and embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) following a 10-minute or 24-hour peptide exposure duration. The in vivo studies demonstrated that R18D resulted in a greater reduction in mean infarct volume compared to R18 (33%, p = 0.004 vs 12%, p = 0.27) after intravenous administration at 300 nmol/kg 30 minutes after MCAO. Both R18D and R18 reduced cerebral hemisphere swelling to a comparable degree (27%, p = 0.03 and 30%, p = 0.02), and improved neurological assessment scores (1.5, p = 0.02 and 2, p = 0.058 vs 3 for vehicle). No abnormal histological findings specific to peptide treatments were observed in hematoxylin and eosin stained sections of kidney, liver, spleen, lung and heart. In vitro studies demonstrated that R18 and R18D were most toxic to neurons, followed by astrocytes, HEK293 and bEND.3 cells, but only at high concentrations and/or following 24-hour exposure. These findings further highlight the neuroprotective properties of poly-arginine peptides, and indicate that R18D at the dose examined is more potent than R18 in Wistar rats, and justify continued investigation of the R18 peptide as a novel neuroprotective agent for stroke.",
      "# Title: Assessment of therapeutic window for poly-arginine-18D (R18D) in a P7 rat model of perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy.\n# Abstract: Hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) remains the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in neonates, with no available neuroprotective therapeutic agent. In the development of a therapeutic for HIE, we examined the neuroprotective efficacy of the poly-arginine peptide R18D (arginine 18 mer synthesised with D-arginine) in a perinatal model of hypoxia-ischaemia (HI; common carotid and external carotid occlusion + 8%O2 /92%N2 for 2.5 hr) in the P7 Sprague-Dawley rat. R18D was administered intraperitoneally 30 min (doses 10, 30, 100, 300 and 1,000 nmol/kg), 60 min (doses 30 and 300 nmol/kg) or 120 min (doses 30 and 300 nmol/kg) after HI. Infarct volumes and behavioural outcomes were measured 48 hr after HI. When administered 30 min after HI, R18D at varying doses reduced infarct volume by 23.7% to 35.6% (p = 0.009 to < 0.0001) and resulted in improvements in the negative geotactic response and wire-hang times, at a dose of 30 nmol/kg. When administered 60 min after HI, R18D at the 30 nmol/kg dose reduced total infarct volume by 34.2% (p = 0.002), whilst the 300 nmol/kg dose improved wire-hang time. When administered 120 min after HI, R18D at the 30 and 300 nmol/kg doses had no significant impact on infarct volume, but the 300 nmol/kg dose improved the negative geotactic response. This study further confirms the neuroprotective properties of poly-arginine peptides, demonstrating that R18D can reduce infarct volume and improve behavioural outcomes after HI if administered up to 60 min after HI and improve behavioural outcomes up to 2 hr after HI.",
      "# Title: Poly-Arginine Peptides R18 and R18D Improve Functional Outcomes After Endothelin-1-Induced Stroke in the Sprague Dawley Rat.\n# Abstract: We have previously demonstrated that R18 and its d-enantiomer, R18D, are neuroprotective at 24 hours following intraluminal filament occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) in the rat. This study examined R18 and R18D effectiveness in improving functional outcomes at up to 56 days poststroke following endothelin-1-induced MCAO. Peptides were administered intravenously at doses of 100, 300, or 1000 nmol/kg, 60 minutes after MCAO. Functional recovery poststroke was assessed using multiple forelimb placing tests and horizontal ladder test, and NA-1 (TAT-NR2B9c), a neuroprotective currently in phase 3 clinical stroke trials, was used as a benchmark. The study demonstrated that R18 (300 and 1000 nmol/kg) was the most effective peptide in improving functional outcomes, followed by R18D (300 and 1000 nmol/kg), and NA-1 (300 and 100 nmol/kg). Furthermore, R18 at doses of 300 and 1000 nmol/kg was the most effective agent in restoring pre-stroke body weight, while R18 and R18D at doses of 300 and 1000 nmol/kg, but not NA-1 also significantly reduced the number of animals requiring hand feeding 48 hours after stroke. This study confirms that R18 and R18D are effective in improving long-term functional outcomes after stroke, and suggests that R18 may be more effective than NA-1.",
      "# Title: Comparative Assessment of the Proteolytic Stability and Impact of Poly-Arginine Peptides R18 and R18D on Infarct Growth and Penumbral Tissue Preservation Following Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in the Sprague Dawley Rat.\n# Abstract: Poly-arginine peptides R18 and R18D have previously been demonstrated to be neuroprotective in ischaemic stroke models. Here we examined the proteolytic stability and efficacy of R18 and R18D in reducing infarct core growth and preserving the ischaemic penumbra following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the Sprague Dawley rat. R18 (300 or 1000 nmol/kg), R18D (300 nmol/kg) or saline were administered intravenously 10 min after MCAO induced using a filament. Serial perfusion and diffusion-weighted MRI imaging was performed to measure changes in the infarct core and penumbra from time points between 45- and 225-min post-occlusion. Repeated measures analyses of infarct growth and penumbral tissue size were evaluated using generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs). R18D (300 nmol/kg) was most effective in slowing infarct core growth (46.8 mm3 reduction; p < 0.001) and preserving penumbral tissue (21.6% increase; p < 0.001), followed by R18 at the 300 nmol/kg dose (core: 29.5 mm3 reduction; p < 0.001, penumbra: 12.5% increase; p < 0.001). R18 at the 1000 nmol/kg dose had a significant impact in slowing core growth (19.5 mm3 reduction; p = 0.026), but only a modest impact on penumbral preservation (6.9% increase; p = 0.062). The in vitro anti-excitotoxic neuroprotective efficacy of R18D was also demonstrated to be unaffected when preincubated for 1-3 h or overnight, in a cell lysate prepared from dying neurons or with the proteolytic enzyme, plasmin, whereas the neuroprotective efficacy of R18 was significantly reduced after a 2-h incubation. These findings highlight the capacity of poly-arginine peptides to reduce infarct growth and preserve the ischaemic penumbra, and confirm the superior efficacy and proteolytic stability of R18D, which indicates that this peptide is likely to retain its neuroprotective properties when co-administered with alteplase during thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke."

    "referenceConclusion": "This systematic review documents the relationship between cognitive performances in PD and backward walking. Two studies, heterogeneous for investigated population, outcome measures, and study protocol, show inconsistent results. Given the evidence of the association between forward walking and executive functions, particularly in PD patients, the present review highlights the need for further research to clarify the impact of cognitive performance on backward walking.",

      "# Title: Comparisons of forward and backward gait between poorer and better attention capabilities in early Parkinson's disease.\n# Abstract: This study compared forward and backward gait between Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with poorer and better attention capabilities. PD and healthy control (HC) participants received a dual-stimuli attention task. The results were assessed using principal component analysis to quantify and rank attention capability. Accordingly, 22 PD and 42 HC subjects were equally divided into poorer (14 PD-P, 18 HC-P) and better (8 PD-B, 24 HC-B) attention capabilities. To analyze the spatiotemporal gait parameters, each participant walked forwards and backwards on a GAITRite(®) walkway. Compared to HC, PD performed worse in the dual task and exhibited slower velocity, less swing, and shorter stride in both walking directions. Notably, PD-P experienced all these gait defects, regardless of directions. PD-B walked worse than HC-B backwards, and displayed comparable gait to HC-P in both directions. In PD and HC, velocity, stride, and swing decreased perceptibly when walking backwards compared to forwards, and the same was true for velocity and stride in PD-P and PD-B. Backward strides were reduced evidently more in PD-P than in PD-B. However, backward swing reductions in PD-P and PD-B were statistically insignificant. Cadence in both directions was similar within the groups and between the groups, and there were little alterations between directions within each group and between groups. These results suggest that attention capability may affect PD gait. Poorer attention exacerbates gait defects and better attention improves gait in both directions. These results may support the application of cuing strategies in PD to enhance attention capability and improve walking gait.",
      "# Title: Investigation of factors impacting mobility and gait in Parkinson disease.\n# Abstract: Mobility and gait limitations are major issues for people with Parkinson disease (PD). Identification of factors that contribute to these impairments may inform treatment and intervention strategies. In this study we investigated factors that predict mobility and gait impairment in PD. Participants with mild to moderate PD and without dementia (n=114) were tested in one session 'off' medication. Mobility measures included the 6-Minute Walk test and Timed-Up-and-Go. Gait velocity was collected in four conditions: forward preferred speed, forward dual task, forward fast as possible and backward walking. The predictors analyzed were age, gender, disease severity, balance, balance confidence, fall history, self-reported physical activity, and executive function. Multiple regression models were used to assess the relationships between predictors and outcomes. The predictors, in different combinations for each outcome measure, explained 55.7% to 66.9% of variability for mobility and 39.5% to 52.8% for gait velocity. Balance was the most relevant factor (explaining up to 54.1% of variance in mobility and up to 45.6% in gait velocity). Balance confidence contributed to a lesser extent (2.0% to 8.2% of variance) in all models. Age explained a small percentage of variance in mobility and gait velocity (up to 2.9%). Executive function explained 3.0% of variance during forward walking only. The strong predictive relationships between balance deficits and mobility and gait impairment suggest targeting balance deficits may be particularly important for improving mobility and gait in people with PD, regardless of an individual's age, disease severity, fall history, or other demographic features."

      "conclusionA": "Backward walking represents a novel and potentially valuable adjunct therapy for improving cognitive function in individuals with Parkinson’s Disease, offering small-to-moderate improvements particularly in executive function and attention, though the magnitude of effect and long-term sustainability require further investigation and are likely influenced by individual patient characteristics and intervention parameters.",
      "conclusionB": "In early Parkinson’s disease, poorer attention capability is associated with greater gait deficits—specifically, reduced velocity and stride length—in both forward and backward walking, while better attention capability mitigates these deficits, particularly during backward walking; however, these findings are specific to individuals assessed ‘off’ medication and with mild to moderate disease severity."

    "referenceConclusion": "Pre-conditioning significantly reduced the severity of creatine kinase release, delayed-onset muscle soreness, loss of maximal voluntary contraction force and the range of motion decrease. Pre-conditioning may prevent severe EIMD and accelerate recovery of muscle force generation capacity. The current systematic review identified that pre-conditioning activities are effective in attenuating EIMD measures, CK, muscle soreness, ROM and maximal voluntary force production. These findings suggest the use of pre-conditioning activities prior to a strenuous bout of exercise does provide a significant protective effect when performed a minimum of 24 h prior to the damaging stimulus. Furthermore, the greater improvement in MVC suggests that the pre-conditioning activities may accelerate the recovery of muscle contractile properties following strenuous exercises. However, it is unclear if pre-conditioning would prevent EIMD from more complex exercises or to what extent EIMD prevention carries over into other modes of exercise.",

      "# Title: Muscle tenderness and peak torque changes after downhill running following a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: Unaccustomed exercise (usually of an eccentric nature) is often followed by delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Previous studies have found that prior eccentric activity produces a training effect which reduces DOMS and morphological changes. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a prior bout of maximal isokinetic eccentric exercise on DOMS, strength loss and plasma creatine kinase (CK) changes following a downhill run. Ten male subjects with a mean (+/- S.D.) age of 22.5 +/- 2.8 years, body mass of 62.67 +/- 0.05 kg and height of 176 +/- 3 cm were allocated to either a treatment group or a control group. The treatment group performed 100 maximal eccentric activations of the knee extensors in the dominant leg at 0.52 rad s-1. Two weeks later, the downhill run was performed on a motor-driven treadmill. This consisted of five bouts of 8 min at a gradient of -10% at a speed corresponding to 80% of the predicted maximal heart rate. The untrained group performed the downhill run as above but without the prior isokinetic session. Tenderness measurements, plasma CK activity and concentric and eccentric isokinetic peak torque measurements of the knee extensors at 0.52 and 2.83 rad s-1 were recorded prior to, immediately following and 2, 4 and 7 days after each protocol. The isokinetic protocol caused an increase (P < 0.01) in CK and tenderness and a decrease (P < 0.05) in concentric and eccentric torque at both speeds in the treatment group. Following the downhill run, a reduction in peak torque (P < 0.01) was observed in the eccentric and concentric modes at both isokinetic speeds in the control group. For the treatment group, the decrease in peak torque occurred only at the faster eccentric speed. With the exception of the faster eccentric speed, the decrement in peak torque was greater in the control group in all post-exercise isokinetic strength tests. There was less tenderness (P < 0.01) in the trained knee extensor muscle group. Peak torque also returned to pre-downhill values earlier for the trained group. Although plasma CK activity increased in both groups after downhill running, it was much lower (P < 0.01) in the trained group. The results suggest that a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric training reduces muscle damage, reduces the amount of strength loss and decreases the sensation of DOMS after downhill running.",
      "# Title: Exercise-induced skeletal muscle damage and adaptation following repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions.\n# Abstract: Repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions were used to examine indirect indices of exercise-induced muscle damage and adaptation in human skeletal muscle. Twenty-four subjects (18 females, 6 males) aged 20.0 +/- 1.4 years (mean +/- S.D.) performed an initial bout of either 10 (n = 7), 30 (n = 9) or 50 (n = 8) maximum voluntary eccentric contractions of the knee extensors, followed by a second bout of 50 contractions 3 weeks later using the same leg. Muscle soreness was elevated after all bouts (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon test), although the initial bout reduced the soreness associated with the second bout. Force loss and a decline in the 20:100 Hz percutaneous electrical myostimulation force ratio were observed after all exercise bouts (P < 0.01). Serum creatine kinase activity was elevated following the initial bouts of 30 and 50 repetitions (P < 0.01), but there was no increase following 10 repetitions. No increase in serum creatine kinase activity was observed in any group following the second bout of contractions (P > 0.05). We conclude that skeletal muscle adaptation can be brought about by a single bout of relatively few eccentric muscle contractions. Increasing the number of eccentric muscle repetitions did not result in an increased prophylactic effect on skeletal muscle.",
      "# Title: Influence of previous concentric exercise on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether a fatiguing concentric exercise performed immediately before eccentric exercise would exacerbate eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. One arm of nine female subjects (mean +/- s: 23.3 +/- 6.7 years) performed 12 maximal eccentric actions of the elbow flexors (ECC), and the other arm performed 100 repetitions of isokinetic concentric actions of the elbow flexors followed by the same eccentric exercise (CON-ECC). The two exercise regimens (ECC and CON-ECC) were separated by 2 weeks and presented in a counterbalanced order. Changes in muscle soreness level, maximal isometric force generation, relaxed and flexed elbow joint angle, upper arm circumference and plasma creatine kinase activity were compared between the ECC and CON-ECC conditions. All measures changed significantly after both ECC and CON-ECC; however, there were significant differences in the changes between the conditions. A lower level of soreness, a faster recovery of maximal isometric force generation, a smaller decrease in relaxed elbow joint angle and a smaller increase in upper arm circumference and creatine kinase activity were evident after the CON-ECC condition compared to the ECC condition. Thus, it would seem that muscle damage was attenuated by performance of previous concentric exercise. An additional experiment using a different group of subjects (n = 5) showed that warm-up exercise before the eccentric exercise also attenuated eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Acute adaptation to low volume eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: Many symptoms of eccentric muscle damage can be substantially reduced if a similar eccentric bout is repeated within several weeks of the initial bout. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a nondamaging, low repetition, low volume eccentric exercise bout could also provide a protective/adaptive effect.",
      "# Title: The repeated bout effect of reduced-load eccentric exercise on elbow flexor muscle damage.\n# Abstract: In this study we investigated the extent to which an initial eccentric exercise consisting of two (2ECC) or six maximal eccentric actions (6ECC) of the elbow flexors would produce a similar effect to 24 maximal eccentric actions (24ECC), on a second bout of 24ECC performed 2 weeks later. Male students (n = 34) were assigned to one of three groups, and with their non-dominant arm performed either 2ECC (n = 12), 6ECC (n = 10), or 24ECC (n = 12) as a first bout of exercise. Two weeks later all groups performed 24ECC. Maximal isometric strength, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration were assessed before, immediately after, and for 4 days after exercise. Changes in all variables were compared between the bouts and groups by a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance. All variables changed significantly (P< 0.05) after 2ECC, 6ECC, and 24ECC, but the amount of change after 2ECC and 6ECC was significantly smaller (P<0.05) than both 6ECC and 24ECC, and 24ECC, respectively. After the second bout, the 6ECC and 24ECC groups showed a profound repeated bout effect, and no significant differences were found between the groups. All variables except muscle soreness were significantly (P< 0.05) larger after the second bout for the 2ECC group, however the changes observed after 24ECC were significantly smaller (P < 0.01) than those observed after the first 24ECC of the 24ECC group. These results suggest that it is not necessary to conduct a high number of eccentric actions in the first bout to elicit a repeated bout effect in a subsequent bout performed some time later.",

      "# Title: Intensity of eccentric exercise, shift of optimum angle, and the magnitude of repeated-bout effect.\n# Abstract: This study compared the effect of four different intensities of initial eccentric exercise (ECC1) on optimum angle shift and extent of muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise. Fifty-two male students were placed into 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% groups (n = 13 per group), performing 30 eccentric actions of the elbow flexors of 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% of maximal isometric strength [maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)] for ECC1, followed 2-3 wk later by a similar exercise (ECC2) that used 100% MVC load. MVC at six elbow joint angles, range of motion, upper arm circumference, serum creatine kinase activity, myoglobin concentration, and muscle soreness were measured before and for 5 days following ECC1 and ECC2. A rightward shift of optimum angle following ECC1 was significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 100% and 80% than for the 60% and 40% groups, and it decreased significantly (P < 0.05) from immediately to 5 days postexercise. By the time ECC2 was performed, only the 100% group kept a significant shift (4 degrees). Changes in most of the criterion measures following ECC1 were significantly greater for the 100% and 80% groups compared with the 60% and 40% groups. Changes in the criterion measures following ECC2 were significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 40% group compared with other groups. Although the magnitude of repeated bout effect following ECC2 was significantly (P < 0.05) smaller for the 40% and 60% groups, all groups showed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced changes in criterion measures following ECC2 compared with the ECC1 100% bout. We conclude that the repeated-bout effect was not dependent on the shift of optimum angle.",
      "# Title: Repeated bout effect after maximal eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: We hypothesized that a bout of high or low volume eccentric exercise would protect against muscle damage following a subsequent high volume bout and that adaptation would be attributable to neural changes, independent of the initial exercise volume. Sixteen males performed either 45 (ECC45) or 10 (ECC10) maximal eccentric contractions using the elbow flexors, followed by an ECC45 bout 2 weeks later. Damage markers were measured for the following 96 h; EMG and work done during the first 10 eccentric contractions were also recorded. CK, soreness, and decrements in MVC and range of motion (ROM) were greater in bout 1 than bout 2 (p < 0.01). Soreness, MVC and ROM were greater after the initial ECC45 bout compared to the initial ECC10 bout and the repeated bouts of ECC45 exercise in both groups (p < 0.01). Median frequency decreased from bout 1 to bout 2 (p < 0.001), no differences between groups were observed. An ECC45 bout of maximal eccentric exercise causes more initial damage than an ECC10 bout of maximal eccentric exercise, although both confer protection from subsequent ECC45 bouts of maximal eccentric contractions, which are attributable, at least in part, to a shift in the frequency content of EMG.",
      "# Title: A light load eccentric exercise confers protection against a subsequent bout of more demanding eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that a light eccentric exercise (ECC) that does not induce a loss of muscle function and delayed onset muscle soreness would confer a protective effect against a more strenuous ECC. Eighteen young men were randomly placed into two groups: 10-40% (n=9) and 40% (n=9). Subjects in the 10-40% group performed ECC of the elbow flexors (six sets of five reps) using a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (MVC) at an elbow joint angle of 90 degrees , followed 2 days later by ECC using a dumbbell weight of 40% MVC. Subjects in the 40% group performed the 40% ECC only. Changes in MVC, range of motion (ROM), upper arm circumference (CIR), plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and muscle soreness before, immediately after, 1-5 and 7 days following the 40% ECC were compared between groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any of the criterion measures were found immediately and 1-2 days after the 10% ECC. Following the 40% ECC, the 10-40% group showed significantly (P<0.05) smaller decreases in MVC and ROM, and smaller increases in muscle soreness compared with the 40% group, but no significant differences between groups were evident for CIR and plasma CK activity. These results suggest that the 10% ECC induced some protection against a subsequent bout of 40% ECC performed 2 days later. It appears that the light eccentric exercise preconditioned the muscles for exposure to the subsequent damaging eccentric exercise bout.",
      "# Title: Protection against muscle damage following fifty drop jumps conferred by ten drop jumps.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether 10 drop jumps (DJs) would confer protective effect against muscle damage and soreness in a subsequent bout of 50 DJs. Sixteen men were randomly placed into either a group performing 1 set of 10 DJs followed by 5 sets of 10 DJs (10-50, n = 8) or another group performing 2 bouts of 5 sets of 10 DJs (50-50, n = 8) separated by 2 weeks. The DJs were performed from a box height of 0.6 m, with a 10-second interval between jumps and a 1-minute rest between sets. Jump height, peak vertical ground reaction force, ground contact time, and heart rate during DJs were measured, and blood lactate concentration was assessed before and immediately after DJs. Changes in maximal isometric (ISO) and isokinetic concentric torque (CON), vertical jump, muscle soreness, and plasma creatine kinase activity before, immediately after, and at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours following exercise were compared between groups for the first and second bouts and between the bouts by a 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance. Changes in ISO, CON, vertical jump, and muscle soreness were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller for 10 DJs compared with 50 DJs; however, no significant differences in the measures between groups were evident following the second bout. The changes in the measures following 50 DJs in the 10-50 group were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller than those following the first bout of the 50-50 group. These results suggest that 10 DJs and 50 DJs conferred the same magnitude of protective effect against muscle damage by 50 DJs.",
      "# Title: Muscle damage protection by low-intensity eccentric contractions remains for 2 weeks but not 3 weeks.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that the protective effect conferred by a low-intensity eccentric exercise against maximal eccentric exercise would not last more than a week. Untrained men (21.3 ± 1.6 years) were allocated into either a control or one of four repeated bout groups (n = 13 per group). The repeated bout groups performed 30 low-intensity eccentric contractions (ECC) of the elbow flexors with a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (10%-ECC) either 2 days, 7 days (1 week), 14 days (2 weeks) or 21 days (3 weeks) before 30 maximal eccentric contractions (Max-ECC). The control group performed Max-ECC only. Changes in maximal voluntary contraction strength, optimum angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following 10%-ECC were analysed by a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Changes in the variables following Max-ECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. The 10%-ECC did not change any variables, showing no indication of muscle damage. The changes in all variables following Max-ECC were smaller (P < 0.05) for 2-day, 1- and 2-week groups than control group, without significant differences between 2-day and 1-week groups. The 2-week group showed greater (P < 0.05) changes in all variables compared with 2-day and 1-week groups. Changes in the variables were similar between 3-week and control groups, except for muscle soreness showing smaller (P < 0.05) changes for 3-week group. These results suggest that non-damaging eccentric exercise confers a protective effect against Max-Ecc, but the effect is attenuated between 1 and 2 weeks.",
      "# Title: Two maximal isometric contractions attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVC-ISO) would attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. Young untrained men were placed into one of the two experimental groups or one control group (n = 13 per group). Subjects in the experimental groups performed either two or 10 MVC-ISO of the elbow flexors at a long muscle length (20° flexion) 2 days prior to 30 maximal isokinetic eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors. Subjects in the control group performed the eccentric contractions without MVC-ISO. No significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction peak torque, peak torque angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and myoglobin concentration, muscle soreness, and ultrasound echo intensity were evident after MVC-ISO. Changes in the variables following eccentric contractions were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2 MVC-ISO group (e.g., peak torque loss at 5 days after exercise, 23% ± 3%; peak CK activity, 1964 ± 452 IU·L(-1); peak muscle soreness, 46 ± 4 mm) or the 10 MVC-ISO group (13% ± 3%, 877 ± 198 IU·L(-1), 30 ± 4 mm) compared with the control (34% ± 4%, 6192 ± 1747 IU·L(-1), 66 ± 5 mm). The 10 MVC-ISO group showed smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following eccentric contractions compared with the 2 MVC-ISO group. Therefore, two MVC-ISO conferred potent protective effects against muscle damage, whereas greater protective effect was induced by 10 MVC-ISO, which can be used as a strategy to minimize muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Attenuation of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage by preconditioning exercises.\n# Abstract: This study compared the effect of an initial exercise consisting of either low-intensity eccentric or maximal isometric contractions (ISOs) on protective effect against maximal eccentric contraction (MaxECC)-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions attenuate muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise of the knee extensors in the elderly.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors would attenuate the magnitude of muscle damage induced by maximal eccentric exercise of the same muscle performed 7 days later using elderly individuals. Healthy older men (66.4 ± 4.6 years) were assigned to control or experimental (Exp) group (n = 13 per group). The control group performed six sets of ten maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC) of the knee extensors of non-dominant leg. The Exp group performed six sets of ten low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors on a leg extension machine by lowering a weight of 10 % maximal voluntary isometric knee extension strength (10 %ECC) 7 days prior to MaxECC. Changes in maximal voluntary isokinetic concentric torque (MVC-CON), angle at peak torque, range of motion (ROM), upper thigh circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin (Mb) concentration and B-mode ultrasound echo-intensity before and for 5 days after MaxECC were compared between groups by a mixed factor ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were observed following 10 %ECC. Following MaxECC, all variables changed significantly, and changes in all variables except for angle at peak torque were significantly different between groups. MVC-CON and ROM decreased smaller and recovered faster (P < 0.05) for Exp than control group, and changes in other variables were smaller (P < 0.05) for Exp group compared with control group. These results suggest that preconditioning knee extensor muscles with low-intensity eccentric contractions was effective for attenuating muscle damage induced by subsequent MaxECC of the knee extensors for elderly individuals.",
      "# Title: Effect of two maximal isometric contractions on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the elbow flexors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the time wise protective effect conferred by two maximal voluntary isometric contractions (2MVCs) at 20° elbow flexion on muscle damage induced by 30 maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors (MaxECC). Sixty-five young untrained men were randomly assigned to a control group that did not perform 2MVCs, or one of four experimental groups (n = 13 per group) who performed 2MVCs either immediately (0d), 2 (2d), 4 (4d) or 7 days (7d) before MaxECC. Changes in maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) concentric torque (MVC-CON), optimum angle (OA), range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following MaxECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were evident following 2MVCs. The 2d and 4d groups showed 16-62 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following MaxECC than the control, 0d and 7d groups. The 2d group showed 14-34 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables except for OA compared with the 4d group. The changes in the variables were similar among the control, 0d and 7d groups. These results show that 2MVCs that were performed between 2 and 4 days before MaxECC attenuated the magnitude of muscle damage, but no such effect was evident if the 2MVCs were performed immediately or 7 days before MaxECC. It is concluded that the protective effect conferred by 2MVCs is relatively short-lived, and there is a window for the effect to be conferred.",
      "# Title: Effect of a prior bout of preconditioning exercise on muscle damage from downhill walking.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether reduced-duration downhill walking (DW) would confer a protective effect against muscle damage induced by a subsequent bout of longer duration DW performed 1 week or 4 weeks later. Healthy young adults were allocated to a control or one of the preconditioning exercise (PRE-1wk or PRE-4wk) groups (10 men and 4 women per group). PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups performed 20-min DW (-28% slope, 5 km/h, 10% body mass added to a backpack) 1 week and 4 weeks before 40-min DW, respectively, and the control group performed 40-min DW only. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) knee extension torque, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity, and muscle soreness (100-mm visual analog scale) were measured before, immediately after, and 24, 48, and 72 h after DW, and the changes in these variables were compared among groups. The control group showed symptoms of muscle damage (e.g., prolonged decrease in MVC: -14% ± 10% at 48 h post-DW) after 40-min DW. Changes in all variables after 40-min DW of PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups were 54%-61% smaller (P < 0.05) than the control group, without significant differences between PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups for MVC and plasma CK activity. Importantly, changes after the preconditioning exercise (20-min DW) were 67%-69% smaller (P < 0.05) than those after the 40-min DW of the control group. These findings suggest that 20-min DW resulting in minor muscle damage conferred a protective effect against subsequent 40-min DW, and its effect could last for more than 4 weeks.",

      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors and flexors protect against muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the magnitude and duration of the protective effect of low-intensity eccentric contractions (LowEC) against damage induced by maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) of the knee flexors (KF) and extensors (KE). Young men were assigned to 8 experimental groups and 2 control groups (n = 13/group); the experimental groups performed LowEC of KF or KE 2 days (2d), 1 week (1wk), 2 weeks (2wk), or 3 weeks (3wk) before MaxEC, while the control groups performed MaxEC of KF or KE without LowEC. The 2d, 1wk, 2wk, and 3wk groups performed 30 LowEC of KF or 60 LowEC of KE with a load of 10% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction strength on a resistance-training machine, and all groups performed 30 MaxEC of KF or 60 MaxEC of KE on an isokinetic dynamometer. Several muscle damage markers were measured from before to 2 days after exercise (LowEC) or from before to 5 days after exercise (MaxEC). No significant changes in any variables were evident after LowEC. The changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2d and 1wk groups (e.g., peak creatine kinase activity: 1002 ± 501 IU/L; peak muscle soreness: 13 ± 5 mm) than for the control group (peak creatine kinase activity: 3005 ± 983 IU/L; peak muscle soreness 28 ± 6 mm) for both KE and KF. There were no significant differences between the 2d and 1wk groups or among the 2wk, 3wk, and control groups. These results show that LowEC provided 30%-66% protection against damage induced by MaxEC of KF and KE, and the protective effect lasted 1 week.",
      "# Title: Protective effect by maximal isometric contractions against maximal eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the knee extensors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) performed before maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) would attenuate muscle damage of the knee extensors. Untrained men were placed to an experimental group that performed 6 sets of 10 MVIC at 90° knee flexion 2 weeks before 6 sets of 10 MaxEC or a control group that performed MaxEC only (n = 13/group). Changes in muscle damage markers were assessed before to 5 days after each exercise. Small but significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction torque, range of motion (ROM) and plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity were evident at immediately to 2 days post-MVIC (p < 0.05), but other variables (e.g. thigh girth, myoglobin concentration, B-mode echo intensity) did not change significantly. Changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (p < 0.05) by 45% (soreness)-67% (CK) for the experimental than the control group. These results suggest that MVIC conferred potent protective effect against MaxEC-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Prevention of downhill walking-induced muscle damage by non-damaging downhill walking.\n# Abstract: Mountain trekking involves level, uphill, and downhill walking (DW). Prolonged DW induces damage to leg muscles, reducing force generating ability and muscle coordination. These increase risks for more serious injuries and accidents in mountain trekking, thus a strategy to minimize muscle damage is warranted. It has been shown that low-intensity eccentric contractions confer protective effect on muscle damage induced by high-intensity eccentric contractions. This study tested the hypothesis that 5-min non-damaging DW would attenuate muscle damage induced by 40-min DW, but 5-min level walking (LW) would not.",

It is also known that muscle damage is reduced when maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) are performed at a long muscle length 2-4 days prior to maximal eccentric exercise with the same muscle, a phenomenon that can be described as isometric pre-conditioning (IPC). We tested the hypothesis that IPC could attenuate muscle damage and changes in RE following downhill running. Thirty untrained men were randomly assigned into experimental or control groups and ran downhill on a treadmill (-15%) for 30 min. Participants in the experimental group completed 10 MVIC in a leg press machine two days prior to downhill running, while participants in the control group did not perform IPC. The magnitude of changes in muscle soreness determined 48 h after downhill running was greater for the control group (122 ± 28 mm) than for the experimental group (92 ± 38 mm). Isometric peak torque recovered faster in the experimental group compared with the control group (3 days vs. no full recovery, respectively). No significant effect of IPC was found for countermovement jump height, serum creatine kinase activity or any parameters associated with RE. These results supported the hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in markers of muscle damage. The hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in RE was not supported by our data. It appears that the mechanisms involved in changes in markers of muscle damage and parameters associated with RE following downhill running are not completely shared.",
      "# Title: Damage protective effects conferred by low-intensity eccentric contractions on arm, leg and trunk muscles.\n# Abstract: Low-intensity eccentric contractions with a load corresponding to 10% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction strength (10% EC) attenuate muscle damage in a subsequent bout of higher-intensity eccentric contractions performed within 2 weeks for the elbow flexors, knee flexors and knee extensors. However, it is not known whether this strategy could be applied to other muscles. This study investigated whether 10% EC would confer damage protective effect on high-intensity eccentric contractions (80% EC) for nine different muscle groups.",
      "# Title: Protective Effect Conferred by Isometric Preconditioning Against Slow- and Fast-Velocity Eccentric Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage.\n# Abstract: We investigated if the same isometric preconditioning protocol (IPP) attenuates the magnitude of muscle damage induced by different maximal eccentric exercise protocols in the elbow flexors. Sixty-four untrained men were assigned to either two experimental or two control groups. Participants in the experimental groups performed an IPP prior to either slow (60°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-S) or fast (180°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-F) maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC). Subjects in the control groups performed slow (ECC-S) or fast (ECC-F) MaxECC without IPP. Maximal isokinetic concentric torque (MVC), muscle soreness (SOR), and muscle thickness (MT) were assessed before, immediately after, and 1-4 days following the MaxECC. Significant (p < 0.05) group vs. time interactions were found for MVC (F = 4,517), SOR (F = 6,318), and MT (F = 1,863). The ECC-S group presented faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and MT and less (p < 0.05) SOR at 96 h post-MaxECC compared with ECC-F group. No significant differences in MVC and MT were found between ECC-S and ECC-F groups following MaxECC. The ISO + ECC-S group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and SOR compared to the ECC-S group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ECC-S in any variable. The ISO + ECC-F group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of all assessed variables compared with the ECC-F group. MVC was greater (p < 0.05) at 48-72 h, and SOR was less (p < 0.05) at 48-96 h in the ISO + ECC-F compared to the ECC-F group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ISO + ECC-F for any variable. These results show that the IPP accelerated recovery of MVC and SOR for the slow-eccentric exercise condition and attenuated strength loss and SOR in addition to faster recovery of all assessed variables for the fast-eccentric exercise condition. Therefore, the IPP can be used as a strategy to attenuate and accelerate recovery of muscle damage induced by different-velocity eccentric exercises, resulting in greater protection against muscle damage induced by faster velocity."

      "conclusionA": "Performing a non-damaging, low-intensity bout of eccentric exercise, or even isometric contractions, performed between 2 and 4 days prior to a subsequent maximal eccentric exercise bout significantly attenuates markers of muscle damage, such as reduced soreness, smaller decrements in strength, and lower creatine kinase activity, demonstrating a protective effect that can last for at least 1-2 weeks.",
      "conclusionB": "Based strictly on the provided context, the primary concluding statement is:\n\n**Pre-conditioning exercise consistently attenuates markers of Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage (EIMD) compared to no pre-conditioning, significantly reducing DOMS, CK levels, and preserving muscle function, with the magnitude and duration of this protective effect being critically dependent on the characteristics of the pre-conditioning stimulus (type, intensity, timing) and the characteristics of the subsequent damaging exercise.**"

      "# Title: Thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications in essential thrombocythemia. A retrospective study of 103 patients.\n# Abstract: A retrospective study of 103 patients with essential thrombocythemia was carried out to evaluate the incidence of thrombohemorrhagic complications and establish whether there were any correlations between these events and clinical or laboratory data. At onset or during the course of the disease, 26 patients (25.2%) presented thrombotic and 12 (11.6%) hemorrhagic complications: among the latter, six patients had gastrointestinal bleeding during antiaggregant therapy. No significant correlations were observed between thrombohemorrhagic complications and platelet count, age, sex, platelet function, bleeding time, or therapeutic regimen. However, there was a statistically significant correlation between a positive patient history for thrombotic events and an increase in thromboses. In agreement with other authors, it is believed that the best approach in asymptomatic patients is strict surveillance without treatment. Chemotherapy and/or treatment with antiaggregant agents should be reserved for symptomatic patients or patients with a positive history for thrombotic events.",
      "# Title: Clinical course of essential thrombocythemia in 147 cases.\n# Abstract: The authors retrospectively analyzed the initial characteristics, treatment, and clinical course in 147 patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET). Median age was 60 years and the M:F ratio was 0.69. At diagnosis, 53 patients were asymptomatic; 50 patients had functional symptoms (mainly vasomotor disturbances); 27 patients had large vessel thrombosis; 27 patients had a bleeding diathesis; and seven patients had both bleeding and thrombosis. The platelet count ranged from 0.7 to 2.92 X 10(12)/l. Forty-five of the 61 tested patients (61%) had prolonged bleeding time and/or platelet hypoaggregation. Three patients had in vitro spontaneous aggregation. No significant correlations were found between hemostatic findings and in vivo bleeding or thrombosis. The incidence of bleeding, however, was higher in patients with more than 2 x 10(12)/l platelets. Of 87 karyotypes performed with banding techniques, only four were abnormal. One hundred twenty-nine patients received one or more cytoreductive agents at diagnosis or during follow-up. Sixty patients received an antiaggregating agent. First-line therapy was radiophosphorus (32P) in 22 patients; busulfan in 35 patients; and hydroxyurea in 72 patients. Hydroxyurea required continuous maintenance therapy and had to be changed to another treatment in 12 of the initial responders because of inadequate control of thrombocythemia. During follow-up, 14 treated patients experienced one or several major thrombotic events. Two untreated patients also had major thrombosis. Only one major bleeding event was seen during follow-up. Median actuarial survival was 73.5% at 7 years and only one patient progressed to acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). These results suggest that large vessel thrombosis is the main complication of ET. It appears largely unpredictable in a given patient at diagnosis but can be largely prevented by the control of thrombocythemia. Because of the low incidence of side effects of treatment in this experience, the authors believe that cytoreductive therapy is indicated in most patients with ET, as long as a group of patients with very low risk of thrombosis is not defined in prospective studies.",
      "# Title: Major vascular complications in essential thrombocythemia: a study of the predictive factors in a series of 148 patients.\n# Abstract: To determine the clinicohematological factors predictive for the appearance of major vascular complications (MVC) in patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET), 148 consecutive such patients were retrospectively assessed for the development of MVC during a median follow-up of 58.5 months. Seventy-seven patients had vascular risk factors, and 37 a history of MVC at ET diagnosis. Forty-nine MVC were registered in 33 patients during the follow-up period. The actuarial probability of MVC was 27% at 6 years in the whole series, 35.6% for patients above 60 years, and 21.4% for patients younger than 60 years, whereas only one of the 36 patients younger than 45 years had MVC. At multivariate analysis, age >60 years, history of major ischemia and hypercholesterolemia were the variables associated with an increased MVC risk. These results suggest that all ET patients above 60 years should be treated, whereas in younger patients treatment decisions should be primarily based on the existence of risk factors for MVC.",
      "# Title: Thrombosis and bleeding in myeloproliferative disorders: identification of at-risk patients with whole blood platelet aggregation studies.\n# Abstract: Seventy-five patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders were studied to investigate platelet function by simultaneous measurement of platelet aggregation by the impedance method and ATP dense granule release using a whole blood platelet lumi-aggregometer, in an attempt to identify patients at risk for thrombosis and bleeding. Thirty-nine patients had at least one abnormal result indicating platelet hyperactivity (i.e. impedance or release with one agonist being above the reference range); 16 patients had platelet hypoactivity (i.e. at least one result was below the reference range), whilst 14 had co-existence of hyper- and hypoactivity. Six patients had normal results. 20/53 patients with platelet hyperactivity (alone or mixed) had a positive history of venous and/or arterial thrombosis; in comparison, only two of the other 22 patients had a positive history. During a median follow-up of 33 months, nine patients with and one patient without platelet hyperactivity respectively developed new thrombotic events before the addition of specific therapy. A total of 50 patients with and eight patients without platelet hyperactivity respectively received specific treatment including aspirin and/or cytotoxic therapy. All but one elderly patient with platelet hyperactivity have remained free of new thrombotic events on specific therapy. Two of the 17 patients with platelet hypoactivity had major clinical bleeding. These observations highlight the need to test platelets for hyper- as well as hypo-function and suggest a useful role for routine whole blood platelet aggregation studies to identify the patients at risk for thrombosis or bleeding.",
      "# Title: Incidence, clinical features and outcome of essential thrombocythaemia in a well defined geographical area.\n# Abstract: In an attempt to characterise the clinical features, incidence and outcome of essential thrombocythaemia (ET) we report our experience in a large unselected series of patients from a well defined region. All new cases of ET in the County of Copenhagen were registered during the period 1977-98. We identified 96 cases of ET, yielding an age- and sex-adjusted annual incidence rate of 0.59/100.000 and a point-prevalence at last follow up of 11/100.000. The overall incidence rate was 0.31 and 1.00 per 100.000 population during the consecutive periods 1977-89 and 1990-98, respectively, corresponding to a 3.2-fold increase. Median age at diagnosis was 67 yr (females 68 yr, males 66 yr, range 18-87 yr), and the female to male (F/M) ratio was 2.6:1. At diagnosis, 52% of the patients displayed no ET-related symptoms and were discovered fortuitously by a routine platelet count. Forty-eight percent presented with thrombohaemorrhagic phenomena, of which microvascular disturbances of the central nervous system (CNS), extremities and skin were most frequently observed (23%). Compared to patients diagnosed after 1989, patients diagnosed before 1990 had a significantly higher mean platelet count, white blood cell (WBC) count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) value and alkaline phosphatase value. With a median follow up of 70 months, 5-yr survival was 76%, significantly lower than the expected survival of an age- and sex-matched control group (p = 0.0052). Thirty-seven patients experienced a total of 55 thrombohaemorrhagic events during follow-up, corresponding to an incidence of thrombosis and microvascular disturbances or haemorrhage of 8.1% per pt-yr and 2.5% per pt-yr, respectively. The number of patients experiencing thrombosis or microvascular disturbances was significantly higher among the 29 patients who never received acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) compared to the 67 patients who received ASA during follow up (45% vs. 21%; p = 0.017). This study provides population-based data suggesting the benefit of treatment with low-dose ASA in a non-selected population of patients with ET.",

      "# Title: Frequency and risk factors for thrombosis in idiopathic myelofibrosis: analysis in a series of 155 patients from a single institution.\n# Abstract: Thrombosis is a frequent complication of polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia, but its incidence and predisposing factors in idiopathic myelofibrosis (IM) are unknown. In 18 (11.6%) of 155 patients diagnosed with IM in a single institution, 31 thrombotic events (19 arterial, 12 venous) were registered after a mean follow-up of 4.2 (s.d.: 4.5) years. In six patients, the thrombosis was simultaneous to or appeared a few months before IM diagnosis and 14 had one or more thrombotic episodes. When compared with the general population, a significant increase was observed in the incidence of venous thrombosis (odds ratio 17.5, 95% confidence interval: 10.3-31.4). At multivariate analysis, the initial variables associated with an increased risk of thrombosis were thrombocytosis (platelets >450 x 10(9)/l, P=0.001), presence of one cardiovascular risk factor (arterial hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes, P=0.003), cellular phase of myelofibrosis (P=0.005), and Hb >11 g/dl (P=0.02). Considering post-diagnosis events, the 5-year thrombosis-free survival probability was 90.4% in the series, 80.6% for patients with platelets >450 x 10(9)/l, 82.6% for patients with one cardiovascular risk factor, and 85.1% for those in cellular phase. These results indicate an increased thrombotic risk for IM patients with hyperproliferative features and/or coexistent cardiovascular risk factors.",

      "# Title: Leukocytosis is a risk factor for thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia: interaction with treatment, standard risk factors, and Jak2 mutation status.\n# Abstract: Leukocytes contribute to the pathogenesis of thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia (ET) through recently discovered mechanisms of activation and interaction with platelets and endothelial cells. To evaluate whether an increased leukocyte count was associated with thrombosis and whether this effect can be modulated by therapy, we analyzed the clinical course of 439 patients with ET followed at the Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo. The strength of the association was measured at diagnosis or before thrombotic events by multivariable analyses carried out using data at baseline as well as time-varying covariates. The results showed that (1) an increased leukocyte count at diagnosis was associated with thrombosis during follow-up (\"baseline analysis,\" relative risk [RR] 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-3.9, P = .001); (2) hydroxyurea (HU) lowered leukocytosis and reduced the strength of the association between leukocytosis and thrombosis (\"time-dependent analysis,\" RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.9-2.0, not significant [NS]); (3) the association of leukocytosis and thrombosis was more evident in untreated low-risk patients (RR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-6.4, P = .01) compared with HU-treated high-risk patients (RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.8-3.2, NS); and (4) the presence of JAK2 V617F was not identified as a risk factor for thrombosis during follow-up despite a significant association between the mutation and leukocytosis. We suggest validation of these findings in prospective clinical studies.",
      "# Title: Clinical profile of homozygous JAK2 617V>F mutation in patients with polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia.\n# Abstract: JAK2 617V>F mutation occurs in a homozygous state in 25% to 30% of patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and 2% to 4% with essential thrombocythemia (ET). Whether homozygosity associates with distinct clinical phenotypes is still under debate. This retrospective multicenter study considered 118 JAK2 617V>F homozygous patients (104 PV, 14 ET) whose clinical characteristics were compared with those of 587 heterozygous and 257 wild-type patients. Irrespective of their clinical diagnosis, homozygous patients were older, displayed a higher leukocyte count and hematocrit value at diagnosis, and presented larger spleen volume. Aquagenic pruritus was significantly more common among homozygous PV patients. JAK2 617V>F homozygosity associated with more frequent evolution into secondary myelofibrosis in both PV and ET. After adjustment for sex, age, leukocyte count, and previous thrombosis in a multivariate analysis, homozygous ET patients displayed a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio [HR] 3.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-11.7; P = .013) than wild-type (HR = 1.0) or heterozygous patients (HR = 1.49). No significant association of JAK2 617V>F homozygosity with thrombosis risk was observed in PV. Finally, JAK2 617V>F homozygous patients were more likely to receive chemotherapy for control of disease. We conclude that JAK2 617V>F homozygosity identifies PV or ET patients with a more symptomatic myeloproliferative disorder and is associated with a higher risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with ET.",
      "# Title: Vascular events in Korean patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and their relationship to JAK2 mutation.\n# Abstract: Evaluation of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F mutation has been widely used for the diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). However, its prognostic relevance to clinical outcome is not completely understood. We investigated the association of JAK2 V617F with vascular events in Korean patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). We studied 283 patients from 15 centers, who were diagnosed with MPN. The JAK2 V617F status was evaluated by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. The patients' diagnoses were essential thrombocythemia (ET n = 146), polycythemia vera (PV n = 120), primary myelofibrosis (n = 12), and unclassifiable MPN (MPNu n = 5). JAK2 V617F was detected in 89 (61%) patients with ET, 103 (86%) with PV, four (33%) with myelofibrosis, and four (80%) with MPNu. A higher number of leukocytes, haemoglobin levels and BM cellularity as well as an older age, lower platelet counts, and diagnosis of PV were significantly correlated with JAK2 V617F. Eighty-three and 43 episodes of thrombosis and bleeding occurred in 100 patients each before and after the diagnosis. Vascular events more frequently occurred in 37% of patients with JAK2 V617F than in 29% of those without the mutation (p = 0.045). Among 175 patients whose samples were available for sequencing, 28 patients with homozygous JAK2 V617F had vascular events more frequently (57%) than those who were heterozygotes (39%) or had the wild type (27%) (p = 0.03). The multivariate analysis showed that a JAK2 homozygous mutation, hypercholesterolemia and older age were independent risk factors for a vascular event. The results of this study showed that Korean patients with MPN had a similar JAK2 mutation rate and frequency of vascular events when compared to Western patients. The presence of V617F was significantly related to vascular events. Therefore, initial evaluation for the JAK2 mutation and careful monitoring for vascular events should be performed in MPN patients.",
      "# Title: Thrombosis in primary myelofibrosis: incidence and risk factors.\n# Abstract: We assessed frequency and predictive factors for major cardiovascular (CV) events in 707 patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) followed in 4 European institutions. A total of 236 deaths (33%) were recorded for an overall mortality of 7.7% patient-years (pt-yr). Fatal and nonfatal thromboses were registered in 51 (7.2%) patients, with a rate of 1.75% pt-yr. If deaths from non-CV causes were considered as competing events, we estimated that the adjusted rate of major thrombotic events would have been 2.2% pt-yr. In a multivariable model, age older than 60 years (hazard ratio [HR], 2.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-4.39, P = .01) and JAK2 mutational status (HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.10-3.34; P = .02) were significantly associated with thrombosis, whereas the strength of the association between leukocyte count higher than 15 x 10(9)/L and CV events was of borderline significance (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 0.97-2.72; P = .06). The highest incidence of fatal and nonfatal thrombosis was observed when the mutation was present along with leukocytosis (3.9% pt-yr; HR, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.26-7.81). This study is the largest hitherto carried out in this setting and shows that the rate of major CV events in PMF is comparable with that reported in essential thrombocythemia, and it is increased in aged patients and those with JAK2 V617F mutation and leukocytosis.",
      "# Title: Thrombosis in myelofibrosis: prior thrombosis is the only predictive factor and most venous events are provoked.\n# Abstract: In a retrospective analysis of 205 patients (median age 62 years) with primary myelofibrosis and known JAK2V617F mutational status, 13.2% experienced a vaso-occlusive event at or prior to their diagnosis. After a median follow up of 31 months, post-diagnosis thrombosis occurred in 22 patients (10.7%), including 9 (4.4%) and 16 (7.8%) patients with a total of 9 arterial and 24 venous events, respectively. The majority (71%) of the venous events were temporally associated with other exogenous risk factors for thrombosis such as surgery, line placement or hormonal therapy. On multivariable analysis that included age, JAK2V617F mutation status and leukocyte count as covariates, history of thrombosis was the only predictive variable in general (P=0.04) or when arterial (P=0.007) and venous (P=0.02) thromboses were analyzed separately. The current study demonstrates a higher prevalence of venous, as opposed to arterial, events in PMF, post-diagnosis, and clarifies their nature as being mostly provoked.",
      "# Title: Impact of leukocytosis on thrombotic risk and survival in 532 patients with essential thrombocythemia: a retrospective study.\n# Abstract: Established risk factors for thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia (ET) include age (≥ 60 years) and previous vascular events. Recently, also leukocytosis has been proposed in risk stratification of ET patients. We report a retrospective study on 532 ET patients followed for a median of 7.6 years. Sixty-four patients (12%) developed 95 thrombotic events during follow-up. Together with the high-risk condition, a white blood cell (WBC) value above 11 × 10⁹/L, corresponding to the fourth percentile value, significantly correlated with a higher thrombotic risk (p = 0.033) by Cox proportional hazards. Moreover, the cumulative risk of thrombosis was significantly higher in high-risk patients with WBC >11 × 10⁹/L. JAK2 V617F mutation did not correlate with thrombosis. Overall, 123 (23%) patients died. Three independent parameters were noted as prognostic factors for survival in multivariate analysis: age > 60 years, leukocytosis >11 × 10⁹/L, and hemoglobin level below normal values. Based on these parameters, three groups of risk were defined, with significantly different survivals. Baseline leukocytosis correlated with a higher thrombotic risk in high-risk patients and identified a cohort of patients with worse survival.",
      "# Title: Incidence and risk factors for bleeding in 1104 patients with essential thrombocythemia or prefibrotic myelofibrosis diagnosed according to the 2008 WHO criteria.\n# Abstract: In an international study of 1104 patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET), a histological review according to the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria confirmed ET in 891 patients (WHO-ET, 81%), and revised the diagnosis to prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis (PMF) in 180 patients (PMF, 16%). Major bleeding during follow-up occurred in 55 (6%) WHO-ET and 21 (12%) PMF patients (P = 0.009), at a rate of 0.79 and 1.39% patients per year, respectively, (P = 0.039). In a multivariable analysis, predictors of bleeding included diagnosis of PMF (P = 0.05; hazard ratio (HR) 1.74), leukocytosis (P = 0.04; HR 1.74), previous hemorrhage (P = 0.025; HR 2.35) and aspirin therapy (P=0.001; HR 3.16). The analysis restricted to patients with WHO-ET confirmed previous hemorrhage (P = 0.043; HR 1.92) and aspirin (P=0.027; HR 2.24) as independent risk factors. The current study reveals that major bleeding associated with thrombocytosis might be relatively specific to PMF, as opposed to WHO-defined ET. Furthermore, it shows that low-dose aspirin exacerbates these hemorrhagic events of PMF. In contrast, thrombocytosis per se was not a risk factor for bleeding; however, low-dose aspirin had a synergistic hemorrhagic effect unmasking the bleeding tendency of patients with extreme thrombocytosis. These observations carry significant therapeutic implications in these two WHO entities.",
      "# Title: Leukocytosis as an important risk factor for arterial thrombosis in WHO-defined early/prefibrotic myelofibrosis: an international study of 264 patients.\n# Abstract: We aimed to determine risk factors for thrombotic events in early/prefibrotic myelofibrosis diagnosed according to the World Health Organization criteria. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was calculated on a total number of 264 patients derived from an international database. After a median follow-up of 6.28 years, 42 (15.9%) patients experienced arterial (n = 31) or venous thrombosis (n = 11). A higher leukocyte count correlated with an increased risk for total thrombosis and in particular, with an increased risk for arterial thrombosis (P = 0.005, HR 1.15 and P = 0.047, HR 1.12, respectively). A platelet count above 870 × 10⁹/L was associated with a lower risk for total thrombosis and also for venous thrombosis (P = 0.022, HR 0.44 and P = 0.027, HR 0.19). Moreover, a lower hemoglobin level was associated with an increased risk for venous thrombosis (P = 0.007, HR 0.59). Our data indicate that leukocytosis is a prominent risk factor for thrombosis in early/prefibrotic MF.",

Due to the morbidity and mortality of these events, antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant agents are commonly employed as primary and/or secondary prophylaxis. On the other hand, disease-related bleeding complications (i.e., from esophageal varices) are common in patients with MPN. This analysis was performed to define the frequency of such events, identify risk factors, and assess antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy in a cohort of patients with MPN.",

      "# Title: Thromboses and hemorrhages are common in MPN patients with high JAK2V617F allele burden.\n# Abstract: The most common causes of morbidity and mortality in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications. The JAK2V617F mutation, commonly found in MPN, correlates with several clinical and laboratory characteristics even if the relevance of JAK2V617F allele burden in the natural history of these diseases is unclear. In this study we searched, a relation between thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications and JAK2V617F allele burden level in MPN patients. We evaluated 253 consecutive MPN [121 essential thrombocythemia (ET), 124 polycythemia vera (PV), and 8 primary myelofibrosis (PMF)] patients in whom the JAK2V617F allele burden was available, all studied and followed (median 8.8 years) in our department. Patients were stratified accordingly to their JAK2V617F allele burden, into four quartiles (1st <25%, 2nd 26-50%, 3rd 51-75%, and 4th >75%). Significantly higher incidence of thromboses (p = 0.001) and hemorrhages (p < 0.001) during follow-up has been observed in higher quartiles when compared to lower ones. Thrombosis- and hemorrhage-free survivals were poorer in patients belonging to the highest quartile. Our data suggest that MPN patients with JAK2V617F allele burden higher than 75% have to be considered as high risk patients, being prone to develop thrombo-hemorrhagic complications during the disease course.",
      "# Title: Risk factors for arterial versus venous thrombosis in polycythemia vera: a single center experience in 587 patients.\n# Abstract: In a recent International Working Group on Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) study, prior arterial events and hypertension were predictors of subsequent arterial thrombosis whereas prior venous events and age ≥65 years predicted venous thrombosis in polycythemia vera (PV). In the current study, we sought to validate the above findings and identify additional predictors of arterial versus venous thrombosis. At a median follow up of 109 months, thrombosis after diagnosis occurred in 128 (22%) patients; 82 (14%) arterial and 57 (10%) venous events. On multivariate analysis, prior arterial events (<0.0001), hyperlipidemia (p = 0.03), and hypertension (p = 0.02) predicted subsequent arterial events. In comparison, prior venous events (p = 0.05), leukocytosis ≥11 × 109/L (p = 0.002), and major hemorrhage (p = 0.02) were predictors of subsequent venous events. Salient associations with arterial thrombosis included age ≥ 60 years, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and normal karyotype whereas age ≤ 60 years, females, palpable splenomegaly and history of major hemorrhage were associated with venous thrombosis. TET2 or ASXL1 mutations did not impact arterial nor venous thrombosis. In conclusion, we identify distinct associations for arterial versus venous thrombosis in PV and confirm that a prior arterial or venous thrombotic event is the most reliable predictor of subsequent events.",
      "# Title: Evaluation of vascular events in patients with myeloproliferative syndromes and mutations of either the januskinase-2 or calreticulin gene at the university hospital Krems from 2008 to 2015.\n# Abstract: Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), classified as polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis (ET) and myelofibrosis (MF) are stem-cell derived disorders. Mutations in either the januskinase-2 (JAK-2) or the calreticulin (CALR) gene are characteristic for MPN and may result in enhanced proliferation of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets, and thus increase the risk for vascular events. This study is a retrospective and descriptive analysis of records of patients, who underwent treatment for myeloproliferative syndromes at the Department of Hemato-Oncology of the University hospital Krems from 2008 to the end of 2015. Out of 250 patients, who were suspected for MPN, 51 patients displayed a JAK-2 V617F mutation. These were analyzed with regard to their blood values, gender, age at diagnosis, therapy and vascular events before and after diagnosis (during therapy). Of the 51 patients diagnosed with MPN and a JAK-2 V617F mutation, 33 suffered from PV, 15 from ET and 3 from MF. More men than women were diagnosed with MPN and the median age at diagnosis was 72 years. Acetylsalicylic acid, phlebotomy and Hydroxyurea were the most frequent therapies applied. In our study cohort, the most common vascular events were acute coronary syndrome and transitory ischemic attack. Thromboembolic events were effectively reduced by MPN therapy while no elevation in bleeding events could be observed.",
      "# Title: Clinico-hematological profile and thrombotic/hemorrhagic events in 150 chinese patients with essential thrombocythemia.\n# Abstract: Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is an uncommon chronic myeloproliferative disorder with no cure. Patients with ET are at risk of different complications, and currently there are no optimal prognostic standards to predict severe post-diagnosis complications such as thrombosis and hemorrhage. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the full set of clinical data from 150 Chinese patients with ET enrolled from 2013 to 2016. We discovered that neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), along with other known clinical parameters such as age, leukocyte count, incidence of thrombotic events is higher in patients with JAK2 V617F mutation. NLR is also higher in patients at high-risk stratification of thrombosis. Multivariate analysis showed that age (P = 0.001, 95% CI 1.023-1.089) and JAK2 V617F mutation (P = 0.003, 95% CI 1.837-21.035) were independent factors for thrombotic events, while age (P = 0.005, 95% CI 1.019-1.111) was the only predictive factor for hemorrhagic events at diagnosis. For future thrombotic events, multivariate analysis revealed NLR as the best predictive parameter (P < 0.001, 95% CI 1.173-1.486) when compared with other clinical parameters such as age (P = 0.037, 95% CI 1.004-1.126), thrombosis at diagnosis (P = 0.036, 95% CI 1.077-9.099) and WBC count (P = 0.047, 95% CI 1.001-1.109). Further ROC curve and Kaplan Meier analysis validated NLR as better prognostic marker for future thrombotic events and thrombosis-free survival. In summary, our data suggest that NLR parameter may possess great prognostic significance for future thrombosis in ET patients."

      "conclusionA": "**Primary Concluding Statement:**\n\nAmong patients with Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), including essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), there is a significantly increased risk of both thrombosis and hemorrhage. Key risk factors identified across multiple studies include older age (particularly >60 years), history of prior vascular events (thrombotic or hemorrhagic), leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count), JAK2 V617F mutation status (especially homozygosity in ET), and specific disease characteristics like cellular phase in myelofibrosis or high platelet counts in ET. Low-dose aspirin is associated with a reduced risk of thrombosis in ET, though it may increase bleeding risk, particularly in PMF. Interventions like cytoreductive therapy and antiplatelet agents are used to mitigate these risks, and specific risk stratification models (e.g., IPSET, IPSET-Thrombosis) have been developed to guide management.",
      "conclusionB": "Patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) exhibit an increased risk of both thrombosis and hemorrhage, with the incidence of thrombotic events ranging from approximately 7.2% to 22% per patient-year, and bleeding events occurring in 6-12% of patients; critically, higher JAK2V617F allele burden ( >75%) and leukocytosis are independently associated with increased risk of these vascular complications, particularly arterial thrombosis, while prior thrombotic events are the strongest predictor of future events."

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 49 patients with type 2 diabetes who underwent radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer in the Department of gastroenterology of the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University from Jan to Dec 2020. They were randomly divided into experimental group and control group according to different perioperative management measures. The perioperative C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell (WBC), interleukin-6(IL-6), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), blood glucose fluctuation and postoperative recovery were compared between the two groups. Results: A total of 49 patients were enrolled in the study (23 in the experimental group and 26 in the control group). The degree of stress reaction of the experimental group was lighter than that of the control group. The levels of CRP were significantly different on the 5th and 7th day after operation, IL-6 was significantly different on the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th day after operation, WBC and HOMA-IR were significantly different on the 1st day postoperatively. And the changes of HOMA-IR and blood glucose in experimental group were more gentle than those in control group. All the differences were statistically significant(P<0.05). In the experimental group, the time of first anal exhaust, indwelling time of drainage tube or nasointestinal tube and the total hospitalization time were significantly shorter than those of the control group(P<0.05). Conclusion: ERAS can reduce the degree of inflammatory stress and the postoperative IR level promote the early recovery of patients with gastric cancer complicated with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

    "referenceConclusion": "Pre-conditioning significantly reduced the severity of creatine kinase release, delayed-onset muscle soreness, loss of maximal voluntary contraction force and the range of motion decrease. Pre-conditioning may prevent severe EIMD and accelerate recovery of muscle force generation capacity. The current systematic review identified that pre-conditioning activities are effective in attenuating EIMD measures, CK, muscle soreness, ROM and maximal voluntary force production. These findings suggest the use of pre-conditioning activities prior to a strenuous bout of exercise does provide a significant protective effect when performed a minimum of 24 h prior to the damaging stimulus. Furthermore, the greater improvement in MVC suggests that the pre-conditioning activities may accelerate the recovery of muscle contractile properties following strenuous exercises. However, it is unclear if pre-conditioning would prevent EIMD from more complex exercises or to what extent EIMD prevention carries over into other modes of exercise.",

      "# Title: Muscle tenderness and peak torque changes after downhill running following a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: Unaccustomed exercise (usually of an eccentric nature) is often followed by delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Previous studies have found that prior eccentric activity produces a training effect which reduces DOMS and morphological changes. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a prior bout of maximal isokinetic eccentric exercise on DOMS, strength loss and plasma creatine kinase (CK) changes following a downhill run. Ten male subjects with a mean (+/- S.D.) age of 22.5 +/- 2.8 years, body mass of 62.67 +/- 0.05 kg and height of 176 +/- 3 cm were allocated to either a treatment group or a control group. The treatment group performed 100 maximal eccentric activations of the knee extensors in the dominant leg at 0.52 rad s-1. Two weeks later, the downhill run was performed on a motor-driven treadmill. This consisted of five bouts of 8 min at a gradient of -10% at a speed corresponding to 80% of the predicted maximal heart rate. The untrained group performed the downhill run as above but without the prior isokinetic session. Tenderness measurements, plasma CK activity and concentric and eccentric isokinetic peak torque measurements of the knee extensors at 0.52 and 2.83 rad s-1 were recorded prior to, immediately following and 2, 4 and 7 days after each protocol. The isokinetic protocol caused an increase (P < 0.01) in CK and tenderness and a decrease (P < 0.05) in concentric and eccentric torque at both speeds in the treatment group. Following the downhill run, a reduction in peak torque (P < 0.01) was observed in the eccentric and concentric modes at both isokinetic speeds in the control group. For the treatment group, the decrease in peak torque occurred only at the faster eccentric speed. With the exception of the faster eccentric speed, the decrement in peak torque was greater in the control group in all post-exercise isokinetic strength tests. There was less tenderness (P < 0.01) in the trained knee extensor muscle group. Peak torque also returned to pre-downhill values earlier for the trained group. Although plasma CK activity increased in both groups after downhill running, it was much lower (P < 0.01) in the trained group. The results suggest that a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric training reduces muscle damage, reduces the amount of strength loss and decreases the sensation of DOMS after downhill running.",
      "# Title: Exercise-induced skeletal muscle damage and adaptation following repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions.\n# Abstract: Repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions were used to examine indirect indices of exercise-induced muscle damage and adaptation in human skeletal muscle. Twenty-four subjects (18 females, 6 males) aged 20.0 +/- 1.4 years (mean +/- S.D.) performed an initial bout of either 10 (n = 7), 30 (n = 9) or 50 (n = 8) maximum voluntary eccentric contractions of the knee extensors, followed by a second bout of 50 contractions 3 weeks later using the same leg. Muscle soreness was elevated after all bouts (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon test), although the initial bout reduced the soreness associated with the second bout. Force loss and a decline in the 20:100 Hz percutaneous electrical myostimulation force ratio were observed after all exercise bouts (P < 0.01). Serum creatine kinase activity was elevated following the initial bouts of 30 and 50 repetitions (P < 0.01), but there was no increase following 10 repetitions. No increase in serum creatine kinase activity was observed in any group following the second bout of contractions (P > 0.05). We conclude that skeletal muscle adaptation can be brought about by a single bout of relatively few eccentric muscle contractions. Increasing the number of eccentric muscle repetitions did not result in an increased prophylactic effect on skeletal muscle.",
      "# Title: Influence of previous concentric exercise on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether a fatiguing concentric exercise performed immediately before eccentric exercise would exacerbate eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. One arm of nine female subjects (mean +/- s: 23.3 +/- 6.7 years) performed 12 maximal eccentric actions of the elbow flexors (ECC), and the other arm performed 100 repetitions of isokinetic concentric actions of the elbow flexors followed by the same eccentric exercise (CON-ECC). The two exercise regimens (ECC and CON-ECC) were separated by 2 weeks and presented in a counterbalanced order. Changes in muscle soreness level, maximal isometric force generation, relaxed and flexed elbow joint angle, upper arm circumference and plasma creatine kinase activity were compared between the ECC and CON-ECC conditions. All measures changed significantly after both ECC and CON-ECC; however, there were significant differences in the changes between the conditions. A lower level of soreness, a faster recovery of maximal isometric force generation, a smaller decrease in relaxed elbow joint angle and a smaller increase in upper arm circumference and creatine kinase activity were evident after the CON-ECC condition compared to the ECC condition. Thus, it would seem that muscle damage was attenuated by performance of previous concentric exercise. An additional experiment using a different group of subjects (n = 5) showed that warm-up exercise before the eccentric exercise also attenuated eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.",

      "# Title: The repeated bout effect of reduced-load eccentric exercise on elbow flexor muscle damage.\n# Abstract: In this study we investigated the extent to which an initial eccentric exercise consisting of two (2ECC) or six maximal eccentric actions (6ECC) of the elbow flexors would produce a similar effect to 24 maximal eccentric actions (24ECC), on a second bout of 24ECC performed 2 weeks later. Male students (n = 34) were assigned to one of three groups, and with their non-dominant arm performed either 2ECC (n = 12), 6ECC (n = 10), or 24ECC (n = 12) as a first bout of exercise. Two weeks later all groups performed 24ECC. Maximal isometric strength, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration were assessed before, immediately after, and for 4 days after exercise. Changes in all variables were compared between the bouts and groups by a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance. All variables changed significantly (P< 0.05) after 2ECC, 6ECC, and 24ECC, but the amount of change after 2ECC and 6ECC was significantly smaller (P<0.05) than both 6ECC and 24ECC, and 24ECC, respectively. After the second bout, the 6ECC and 24ECC groups showed a profound repeated bout effect, and no significant differences were found between the groups. All variables except muscle soreness were significantly (P< 0.05) larger after the second bout for the 2ECC group, however the changes observed after 24ECC were significantly smaller (P < 0.01) than those observed after the first 24ECC of the 24ECC group. These results suggest that it is not necessary to conduct a high number of eccentric actions in the first bout to elicit a repeated bout effect in a subsequent bout performed some time later.",

      "# Title: Intensity of eccentric exercise, shift of optimum angle, and the magnitude of repeated-bout effect.\n# Abstract: This study compared the effect of four different intensities of initial eccentric exercise (ECC1) on optimum angle shift and extent of muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise. Fifty-two male students were placed into 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% groups (n = 13 per group), performing 30 eccentric actions of the elbow flexors of 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% of maximal isometric strength [maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)] for ECC1, followed 2-3 wk later by a similar exercise (ECC2) that used 100% MVC load. MVC at six elbow joint angles, range of motion, upper arm circumference, serum creatine kinase activity, myoglobin concentration, and muscle soreness were measured before and for 5 days following ECC1 and ECC2. A rightward shift of optimum angle following ECC1 was significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 100% and 80% than for the 60% and 40% groups, and it decreased significantly (P < 0.05) from immediately to 5 days postexercise. By the time ECC2 was performed, only the 100% group kept a significant shift (4 degrees). Changes in most of the criterion measures following ECC1 were significantly greater for the 100% and 80% groups compared with the 60% and 40% groups. Changes in the criterion measures following ECC2 were significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 40% group compared with other groups. Although the magnitude of repeated bout effect following ECC2 was significantly (P < 0.05) smaller for the 40% and 60% groups, all groups showed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced changes in criterion measures following ECC2 compared with the ECC1 100% bout. We conclude that the repeated-bout effect was not dependent on the shift of optimum angle.",
      "# Title: Repeated bout effect after maximal eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: We hypothesized that a bout of high or low volume eccentric exercise would protect against muscle damage following a subsequent high volume bout and that adaptation would be attributable to neural changes, independent of the initial exercise volume. Sixteen males performed either 45 (ECC45) or 10 (ECC10) maximal eccentric contractions using the elbow flexors, followed by an ECC45 bout 2 weeks later. Damage markers were measured for the following 96 h; EMG and work done during the first 10 eccentric contractions were also recorded. CK, soreness, and decrements in MVC and range of motion (ROM) were greater in bout 1 than bout 2 (p < 0.01). Soreness, MVC and ROM were greater after the initial ECC45 bout compared to the initial ECC10 bout and the repeated bouts of ECC45 exercise in both groups (p < 0.01). Median frequency decreased from bout 1 to bout 2 (p < 0.001), no differences between groups were observed. An ECC45 bout of maximal eccentric exercise causes more initial damage than an ECC10 bout of maximal eccentric exercise, although both confer protection from subsequent ECC45 bouts of maximal eccentric contractions, which are attributable, at least in part, to a shift in the frequency content of EMG.",
      "# Title: A light load eccentric exercise confers protection against a subsequent bout of more demanding eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that a light eccentric exercise (ECC) that does not induce a loss of muscle function and delayed onset muscle soreness would confer a protective effect against a more strenuous ECC. Eighteen young men were randomly placed into two groups: 10-40% (n=9) and 40% (n=9). Subjects in the 10-40% group performed ECC of the elbow flexors (six sets of five reps) using a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (MVC) at an elbow joint angle of 90 degrees , followed 2 days later by ECC using a dumbbell weight of 40% MVC. Subjects in the 40% group performed the 40% ECC only. Changes in MVC, range of motion (ROM), upper arm circumference (CIR), plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and muscle soreness before, immediately after, 1-5 and 7 days following the 40% ECC were compared between groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any of the criterion measures were found immediately and 1-2 days after the 10% ECC. Following the 40% ECC, the 10-40% group showed significantly (P<0.05) smaller decreases in MVC and ROM, and smaller increases in muscle soreness compared with the 40% group, but no significant differences between groups were evident for CIR and plasma CK activity. These results suggest that the 10% ECC induced some protection against a subsequent bout of 40% ECC performed 2 days later. It appears that the light eccentric exercise preconditioned the muscles for exposure to the subsequent damaging eccentric exercise bout.",
      "# Title: Protection against muscle damage following fifty drop jumps conferred by ten drop jumps.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether 10 drop jumps (DJs) would confer protective effect against muscle damage and soreness in a subsequent bout of 50 DJs. Sixteen men were randomly placed into either a group performing 1 set of 10 DJs followed by 5 sets of 10 DJs (10-50, n = 8) or another group performing 2 bouts of 5 sets of 10 DJs (50-50, n = 8) separated by 2 weeks. The DJs were performed from a box height of 0.6 m, with a 10-second interval between jumps and a 1-minute rest between sets. Jump height, peak vertical ground reaction force, ground contact time, and heart rate during DJs were measured, and blood lactate concentration was assessed before and immediately after DJs. Changes in maximal isometric (ISO) and isokinetic concentric torque (CON), vertical jump, muscle soreness, and plasma creatine kinase activity before, immediately after, and at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours following exercise were compared between groups for the first and second bouts and between the bouts by a 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance. Changes in ISO, CON, vertical jump, and muscle soreness were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller for 10 DJs compared with 50 DJs; however, no significant differences in the measures between groups were evident following the second bout. The changes in the measures following 50 DJs in the 10-50 group were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller than those following the first bout of the 50-50 group. These results suggest that 10 DJs and 50 DJs conferred the same magnitude of protective effect against muscle damage by 50 DJs.",
      "# Title: Muscle damage protection by low-intensity eccentric contractions remains for 2 weeks but not 3 weeks.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that the protective effect conferred by a low-intensity eccentric exercise against maximal eccentric exercise would not last more than a week. Untrained men (21.3 ± 1.6 years) were allocated into either a control or one of four repeated bout groups (n = 13 per group). The repeated bout groups performed 30 low-intensity eccentric contractions (ECC) of the elbow flexors with a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (10%-ECC) either 2 days, 7 days (1 week), 14 days (2 weeks) or 21 days (3 weeks) before 30 maximal eccentric contractions (Max-ECC). The control group performed Max-ECC only. Changes in maximal voluntary contraction strength, optimum angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following 10%-ECC were analysed by a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Changes in the variables following Max-ECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. The 10%-ECC did not change any variables, showing no indication of muscle damage. The changes in all variables following Max-ECC were smaller (P < 0.05) for 2-day, 1- and 2-week groups than control group, without significant differences between 2-day and 1-week groups. The 2-week group showed greater (P < 0.05) changes in all variables compared with 2-day and 1-week groups. Changes in the variables were similar between 3-week and control groups, except for muscle soreness showing smaller (P < 0.05) changes for 3-week group. These results suggest that non-damaging eccentric exercise confers a protective effect against Max-Ecc, but the effect is attenuated between 1 and 2 weeks.",
      "# Title: Two maximal isometric contractions attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVC-ISO) would attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. Young untrained men were placed into one of the two experimental groups or one control group (n = 13 per group). Subjects in the experimental groups performed either two or 10 MVC-ISO of the elbow flexors at a long muscle length (20° flexion) 2 days prior to 30 maximal isokinetic eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors. Subjects in the control group performed the eccentric contractions without MVC-ISO. No significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction peak torque, peak torque angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and myoglobin concentration, muscle soreness, and ultrasound echo intensity were evident after MVC-ISO. Changes in the variables following eccentric contractions were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2 MVC-ISO group (e.g., peak torque loss at 5 days after exercise, 23% ± 3%; peak CK activity, 1964 ± 452 IU·L(-1); peak muscle soreness, 46 ± 4 mm) or the 10 MVC-ISO group (13% ± 3%, 877 ± 198 IU·L(-1), 30 ± 4 mm) compared with the control (34% ± 4%, 6192 ± 1747 IU·L(-1), 66 ± 5 mm). The 10 MVC-ISO group showed smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following eccentric contractions compared with the 2 MVC-ISO group. Therefore, two MVC-ISO conferred potent protective effects against muscle damage, whereas greater protective effect was induced by 10 MVC-ISO, which can be used as a strategy to minimize muscle damage.",

      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions attenuate muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise of the knee extensors in the elderly.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors would attenuate the magnitude of muscle damage induced by maximal eccentric exercise of the same muscle performed 7 days later using elderly individuals. Healthy older men (66.4 ± 4.6 years) were assigned to control or experimental (Exp) group (n = 13 per group). The control group performed six sets of ten maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC) of the knee extensors of non-dominant leg. The Exp group performed six sets of ten low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors on a leg extension machine by lowering a weight of 10 % maximal voluntary isometric knee extension strength (10 %ECC) 7 days prior to MaxECC. Changes in maximal voluntary isokinetic concentric torque (MVC-CON), angle at peak torque, range of motion (ROM), upper thigh circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin (Mb) concentration and B-mode ultrasound echo-intensity before and for 5 days after MaxECC were compared between groups by a mixed factor ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were observed following 10 %ECC. Following MaxECC, all variables changed significantly, and changes in all variables except for angle at peak torque were significantly different between groups. MVC-CON and ROM decreased smaller and recovered faster (P < 0.05) for Exp than control group, and changes in other variables were smaller (P < 0.05) for Exp group compared with control group. These results suggest that preconditioning knee extensor muscles with low-intensity eccentric contractions was effective for attenuating muscle damage induced by subsequent MaxECC of the knee extensors for elderly individuals.",
      "# Title: Effect of two maximal isometric contractions on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the elbow flexors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the time wise protective effect conferred by two maximal voluntary isometric contractions (2MVCs) at 20° elbow flexion on muscle damage induced by 30 maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors (MaxECC). Sixty-five young untrained men were randomly assigned to a control group that did not perform 2MVCs, or one of four experimental groups (n = 13 per group) who performed 2MVCs either immediately (0d), 2 (2d), 4 (4d) or 7 days (7d) before MaxECC. Changes in maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) concentric torque (MVC-CON), optimum angle (OA), range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following MaxECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were evident following 2MVCs. The 2d and 4d groups showed 16-62 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following MaxECC than the control, 0d and 7d groups. The 2d group showed 14-34 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables except for OA compared with the 4d group. The changes in the variables were similar among the control, 0d and 7d groups. These results show that 2MVCs that were performed between 2 and 4 days before MaxECC attenuated the magnitude of muscle damage, but no such effect was evident if the 2MVCs were performed immediately or 7 days before MaxECC. It is concluded that the protective effect conferred by 2MVCs is relatively short-lived, and there is a window for the effect to be conferred.",
      "# Title: Effect of a prior bout of preconditioning exercise on muscle damage from downhill walking.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether reduced-duration downhill walking (DW) would confer a protective effect against muscle damage induced by a subsequent bout of longer duration DW performed 1 week or 4 weeks later. Healthy young adults were allocated to a control or one of the preconditioning exercise (PRE-1wk or PRE-4wk) groups (10 men and 4 women per group). PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups performed 20-min DW (-28% slope, 5 km/h, 10% body mass added to a backpack) 1 week and 4 weeks before 40-min DW, respectively, and the control group performed 40-min DW only. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) knee extension torque, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity, and muscle soreness (100-mm visual analog scale) were measured before, immediately after, and 24, 48, and 72 h after DW, and the changes in these variables were compared among groups. The control group showed symptoms of muscle damage (e.g., prolonged decrease in MVC: -14% ± 10% at 48 h post-DW) after 40-min DW. Changes in all variables after 40-min DW of PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups were 54%-61% smaller (P < 0.05) than the control group, without significant differences between PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups for MVC and plasma CK activity. Importantly, changes after the preconditioning exercise (20-min DW) were 67%-69% smaller (P < 0.05) than those after the 40-min DW of the control group. These findings suggest that 20-min DW resulting in minor muscle damage conferred a protective effect against subsequent 40-min DW, and its effect could last for more than 4 weeks.",

      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors and flexors protect against muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the magnitude and duration of the protective effect of low-intensity eccentric contractions (LowEC) against damage induced by maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) of the knee flexors (KF) and extensors (KE). Young men were assigned to 8 experimental groups and 2 control groups (n = 13/group); the experimental groups performed LowEC of KF or KE 2 days (2d), 1 week (1wk), 2 weeks (2wk), or 3 weeks (3wk) before MaxEC, while the control groups performed MaxEC of KF or KE without LowEC. The 2d, 1wk, 2wk, and 3wk groups performed 30 LowEC of KF or 60 LowEC of KE with a load of 10% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction strength on a resistance-training machine, and all groups performed 30 MaxEC of KF or 60 MaxEC of KE on an isokinetic dynamometer. Several muscle damage markers were measured from before to 2 days after exercise (LowEC) or from before to 5 days after exercise (MaxEC). No significant changes in any variables were evident after LowEC. The changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2d and 1wk groups (e.g., peak creatine kinase activity: 1002 ± 501 IU/L; peak muscle soreness: 13 ± 5 mm) than for the control group (peak creatine kinase activity: 3005 ± 983 IU/L; peak muscle soreness 28 ± 6 mm) for both KE and KF. There were no significant differences between the 2d and 1wk groups or among the 2wk, 3wk, and control groups. These results show that LowEC provided 30%-66% protection against damage induced by MaxEC of KF and KE, and the protective effect lasted 1 week.",

Changes in muscle damage markers were assessed before to 5 days after each exercise. Small but significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction torque, range of motion (ROM) and plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity were evident at immediately to 2 days post-MVIC (p < 0.05), but other variables (e.g. thigh girth, myoglobin concentration, B-mode echo intensity) did not change significantly. Changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (p < 0.05) by 45% (soreness)-67% (CK) for the experimental than the control group. These results suggest that MVIC conferred potent protective effect against MaxEC-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Prevention of downhill walking-induced muscle damage by non-damaging downhill walking.\n# Abstract: Mountain trekking involves level, uphill, and downhill walking (DW). Prolonged DW induces damage to leg muscles, reducing force generating ability and muscle coordination. These increase risks for more serious injuries and accidents in mountain trekking, thus a strategy to minimize muscle damage is warranted. It has been shown that low-intensity eccentric contractions confer protective effect on muscle damage induced by high-intensity eccentric contractions. This study tested the hypothesis that 5-min non-damaging DW would attenuate muscle damage induced by 40-min DW, but 5-min level walking (LW) would not.",
      "# Title: Isometric pre-conditioning blunts exercise-induced muscle damage but does not attenuate changes in running economy following downhill running.\n# Abstract: Running economy (RE) is impaired following unaccustomed eccentric-biased exercises that induce muscle damage. It is also known that muscle damage is reduced when maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) are performed at a long muscle length 2-4 days prior to maximal eccentric exercise with the same muscle, a phenomenon that can be described as isometric pre-conditioning (IPC). We tested the hypothesis that IPC could attenuate muscle damage and changes in RE following downhill running. Thirty untrained men were randomly assigned into experimental or control groups and ran downhill on a treadmill (-15%) for 30 min. Participants in the experimental group completed 10 MVIC in a leg press machine two days prior to downhill running, while participants in the control group did not perform IPC. The magnitude of changes in muscle soreness determined 48 h after downhill running was greater for the control group (122 ± 28 mm) than for the experimental group (92 ± 38 mm). Isometric peak torque recovered faster in the experimental group compared with the control group (3 days vs. no full recovery, respectively). No significant effect of IPC was found for countermovement jump height, serum creatine kinase activity or any parameters associated with RE. These results supported the hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in markers of muscle damage. The hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in RE was not supported by our data. It appears that the mechanisms involved in changes in markers of muscle damage and parameters associated with RE following downhill running are not completely shared.",

This study investigated whether 10% EC would confer damage protective effect on high-intensity eccentric contractions (80% EC) for nine different muscle groups.",
      "# Title: Protective Effect Conferred by Isometric Preconditioning Against Slow- and Fast-Velocity Eccentric Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage.\n# Abstract: We investigated if the same isometric preconditioning protocol (IPP) attenuates the magnitude of muscle damage induced by different maximal eccentric exercise protocols in the elbow flexors. Sixty-four untrained men were assigned to either two experimental or two control groups. Participants in the experimental groups performed an IPP prior to either slow (60°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-S) or fast (180°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-F) maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC). Subjects in the control groups performed slow (ECC-S) or fast (ECC-F) MaxECC without IPP. Maximal isokinetic concentric torque (MVC), muscle soreness (SOR), and muscle thickness (MT) were assessed before, immediately after, and 1-4 days following the MaxECC. Significant (p < 0.05) group vs. time interactions were found for MVC (F = 4,517), SOR (F = 6,318), and MT (F = 1,863). The ECC-S group presented faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and MT and less (p < 0.05) SOR at 96 h post-MaxECC compared with ECC-F group. No significant differences in MVC and MT were found between ECC-S and ECC-F groups following MaxECC. The ISO + ECC-S group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and SOR compared to the ECC-S group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ECC-S in any variable. The ISO + ECC-F group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of all assessed variables compared with the ECC-F group. MVC was greater (p < 0.05) at 48-72 h, and SOR was less (p < 0.05) at 48-96 h in the ISO + ECC-F compared to the ECC-F group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ISO + ECC-F for any variable. These results show that the IPP accelerated recovery of MVC and SOR for the slow-eccentric exercise condition and attenuated strength loss and SOR in addition to faster recovery of all assessed variables for the fast-eccentric exercise condition. Therefore, the IPP can be used as a strategy to attenuate and accelerate recovery of muscle damage induced by different-velocity eccentric exercises, resulting in greater protection against muscle damage induced by faster velocity."

      "conclusionA": "Performing a non-damaging, low-intensity bout of eccentric exercise, or even isometric contractions, performed between 2 and 4 days prior to a subsequent maximal eccentric exercise bout significantly attenuates markers of muscle damage, such as reduced soreness, smaller decrements in strength, and lower creatine kinase activity, demonstrating a protective effect that can last for at least 1-2 weeks.",
      "conclusionB": "Performing a prior bout of low-to-moderate volume eccentric or isometric exercise—even as little as two maximal isometric contractions or 10-50 eccentric actions—significantly attenuates subsequent exercise-induced muscle damage, typically within a window of 1-2 weeks, regardless of exercise modality (downhill walking, elbow flexors, knee extensors) or contraction velocity; however, this protective effect is not sustained beyond 2-3 weeks."

We examined WFA+ -M2BP levels in patients with F4 (cirrhosis), F3 or more (advanced fibrosis) and F2 or more (significant fibrosis) in the two groups. We further examined the relationship between five fibrosis markers and the degree of fibrosis. The WFA+ -M2BP values ranged from 0.25 cut-off index (COI) to 12.9 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 0.34-20.0 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P<.0001). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F4 in the two groups were 2.83 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 5.03 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P=.0046). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F3 or more in the two groups were 1.79 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 3.79 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P<.0001). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F2 or more in the two groups were 1.49 COI in the hepatitis B cohort and 3.19 COI in the hepatitis C group (P<.0001). Among five liver fibrosis markers, WFA+ -M2BP had the highest correlation coefficient (rs =.629) in terms of correlation with the degree of fibrosis in the patients with hepatitis C and had the second highest rs value (.415) in the hepatitis B group. Although WFA+ -M2BP could be a useful indicator of liver fibrosis, WFA+ -M2BP levels in the two groups significantly differed even in the same degree of fibrosis. Individual cut-off values in each aetiology for the degree of fibrosis should be determined.",
      "# Title: Serum Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n# Abstract: Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein (WFA+-M2BP) has been suggested to be useful for the assessment of disease severity in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Consecutive adult NAFLD patients who had a liver biopsy were included. Serum WFA+-M2BP level was measured using a lectin-antibody sandwich immunoassay using a chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay machine (HISCL-5000, Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). The measured levels were indexed using the following equation: Cut-off index (COI) = ([WFA+-M2BP]sample-[WFA+-M2BP]NC) / ([WFA+-M2BP]PC-[WFA+-M2BP]NC), where PC = positive control and NC = negative control. Histopathological examination of liver biopsy specimen was reported according to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Clinical Research Network Scoring System. Data for 220 cases were analyzed. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of NASH was 0.65. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of steatosis grade ≥2 and 3 was 0.64 and 0.53, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of lobular inflammation grade ≥1, ≥2 and 3 was 0.57, 0.68 and 0.59, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of hepatocyte ballooning grade ≥1 and 2 was 0.64 and 0.65, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of fibrosis stage ≥1, ≥2, ≥3 and 4 was 0.61, 0.71, 0.74 and 0.84, respectively. Out of the 220 cases, 152 cases were the same 76 patients who had a repeat liver biopsy after 48 weeks of intervention. The AUROC of the change in the COI to detect improvement in steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning and fibrosis was 0.57, 0.54, 0.59 and 0.52, respectively. In conclusion, serum WFA+-M2BP was most useful for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in NAFLD patients. However, it was less useful for differentiating NASH from non-NASH, and for diagnosis and follow-up of the individual histopathological components of NASH.",

We assessed its efficacy in evaluating liver disease severity in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in Taiwan. The association between WFA+-M2BP and histological features was evaluated among those CHC patients underwent liver biopsy. We also aimed to clarify the factors determining the performance of WFA+-M2BP in CHC. A total of 229 CHC patients were consecutively recruited. The mean value of WFA+-M2BP in patients from F0 to F4 was 1.68, 2.23, 3.45, 3.48, 3.77 respectively (linear trend P = 0.008). Linear regression analysis revealed that alanine aminotransferase (odds ratio [OR]: 0.03, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.02-0.05, P < 0.001), AST (OR: -0.1, 95% CI: -0.02 to -0.01, P < 0.001), and liver fibrosis (OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.01-0.59, P = 0.043) were the independent factors correlated to serum WFA+-M2BP level. The optimal cutoff values of WFA+-M2BP for fibrosis stages F1, F2, F3, and F4 were 1.42, 1.61, 1.42, and 2.67, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the platelet count (OR/CI: -0.009/0.986-0.996, P = <0.001), r-glutamyl transferase (OR/CI: 0.007/1.000-1.013, P = 0.036), and WFA+-M2BP (OR/CI: 0.187/1.057-1.374, P = 0.005).

      "# Title: Comparison of serum fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B.\n# Abstract: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The diagnosis of liver fibrosis has a key role in selecting patients with CHB for antiviral treatment. However, serum biomarkers demonstrate limited diagnostic utility. The present study aimed to compare the performances of fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB and to identify the most appropriate biomarker for these patients. The current study included 96 antiviral-naïve patients with CHB who underwent liver biopsy. METAVIR scoring system was used to assess liver fibrosis and necroinflammation. The diagnostic performances were evaluated of the platelet (PLT) count; the levels of hyaluronan, serum 7S domain of type 4 collagen, procollagen type III N-terminal peptide, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1, Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) and N-terminal type III collagen propeptide (Pro-C3); the fibrosis index based on four factors; the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index; and enhanced liver fibrosis score for identifying significant liver fibrosis [≥fibrosis stage 2 (F2)]. All fibrosis biomarkers, except the Pro-C3 level, correlated with the fibrosis stage. M2BPGi was better than other biomarkers for diagnosing ≥F2, with the highest area under the curve of 0.902. M2BPGi demonstrated a higher diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis than mild/severe fibrosis or cirrhosis. However, no significant correlation was observed between the M2BPGi level and fibrosis stage in patients with CHB having significant liver necroinflammation defined as ≥ necroinflammatory activity 2. The M2BPGi level and PLT count were exclusively correlated with the fibrosis stage in 73 patients without significant liver necroinflammation. M2BPGi demonstrated the highest diagnostic performance for significant fibrosis in patients having significant liver fibrosis with no significant liver necroinflammation. In conclusion, the M2BPGi level can accurately diagnose significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB.",

The mean values of WFA+ -M2BP were 1.0, 1.0, 0.8, and 2.2 in Metavir fibrosis stage F0, F1, F2, and F3-4, respectively (linear trend p = 0.005). The optimal cut-off value of WFA+ -M2BP in predicting advanced fibrosis (F3-4) was 1.37 cut-off index (COI), yielding the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, and accuracy of 75.0, 79.4, 39.1, 94.7, and 78.7%, respectively (p < 0.001). Combining WFA+ -M2BP with FIB-4 significantly increased the diagnostic performance for advanced fibrosis, yielding specificity, PPV, and accuracy of 100, 100, and 93%, respectively. The significant factors predicting advanced liver fibrosis in the multivariate regression analysis were WFA+ -M2BP ≥ 1.37 COI (OR/confidence interval [CI]: 9.49/1.63-55.21, p = 0.01) and FIB-4 ≥ 2.80 (OR/CI: 38.18/4.89-297.93, p = 0.001). Monitoring WFA+ -M2BP is suitable for noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis in NASH patients, particularly in combination with FIB-4."

    "referenceConclusion": "The primary goal of this review was to scope evidence regarding neurocognitive and neurophysiological functions that could be related to ACL injury in athletes and to synthesize them into RTS and rehabilitation paradigms. The existing evidence shows that cognitive skills and CNS functions may be linked to an increased injury risk and diminish postinjury performance in athletes. Cortical reorganization may demand compensatory strategies and occupy cognitive reserve, which makes it difficult to manage dynamic environment in sports. RTS and rehabilitation concepts should consider this notion to prevent second injuries and to achieve an adequate competitive level in athletes.",

      "# Title: Brain Activation for Knee Movement Measured Days Before Second Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury: Neuroimaging in Musculoskeletal Medicine.\n# Abstract: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury has multifactorial causes encompassing mechanical, hormonal, exposure, and anatomical factors. Alterations in the central nervous system also play a role, but their influence after injury, recovery, and recurrent injury remain unknown. Modern neuroimaging techniques can be used to elucidate the underlying functional and structural alterations of the brain that predicate the neuromuscular control adaptations associated with ACL injury. This knowledge will further our understanding of the neural adaptations after ACL injury and rehabilitation and in relation to injury risk. In this paper, we describe the measurement of brain activation during knee extension-flexion after ACL injury and reconstruction and 26 days before a contralateral ACL injury.",
      "# Title: Corticospinal and intracortical excitability differ between athletes early after ACLR and matched controls.\n# Abstract: Neuromuscular impairments, such as quadriceps weakness and activation deficits, persist after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Recent research demonstrating changes in the function of the primary motor cortex after ACLR posits that quadriceps impairments may be influenced by reduced corticospinal excitability. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the integrity of the neuromotor axis of the vastus medialis is altered in subjects 2 weeks post-ACLR compared to uninjured control subjects. Eighteen athletes 2 weeks post-ACLR and 18 age and sex matched uninjured control subjects participated in this cross-sectional study. We quantified corticospinal (resting motor threshold, RMT; motor evoked potential amplitudes at 120% RMT, MEP120 ) and intracortical (inhibition and facilitation) excitability using single and paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), respectively. We assessed spinal-reflex excitability (H-reflex amplitude normalized to maximal M-wave, H/M ratio) using peripheral stimulation. Subjects post-ACLR had higher RMTs (p = 0.001), greater MEP120 amplitudes (p = 0.001), and more asymmetric facilitation (p = 0.041) than the uninjured control subjects. No significant group differences were found for intracortical inhibition (p = 0.289) and H/M ratio (p = 0.332). Our findings indicate that both intracortical and corticospinal excitability of vastus medialis are bilaterally altered in subjects 2 weeks after ACLR. Given persistent neuromuscular deficits seen after ACLR, rehabilitation strategies targeting intracortical and corticospinal deficits may potentially improve clinical outcomes. © 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

      "# Title: Quadriceps muscle function following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: systemic differences in neural and morphological characteristics.\n# Abstract: Quadriceps muscle dysfunction is common following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Data considering the diversity of neural changes, in-concert with morphological adaptations of the quadriceps muscle, are lacking. We investigated bilateral differences in neural and morphological characteristics of the quadriceps muscle in ACLR participants (n = 11, month post-surgery: 69.4 ± 22.4) compared to controls matched by sex, age, height, weight, limb dominance, and activity level. Spinal reflex excitability was assessed using Hoffmann reflexes (H:M); corticospinal excitability was quantified via active motor thresholds (AMT) and motor-evoked potentials (MEP) using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Cortical activation was assessed using a knee flexion/extension task with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Muscle volume was quantified using structural MRI. Muscle strength and patient-reported outcomes were also collected. 2 × 2 RM ANOVAs were used to evaluate group differences. Smaller quadriceps muscle volume (total volume, rectus femoris, vastus medialis, and intermedius) and lower strength were detected compared to contralateral and control limbs. Individuals with ACLR reported higher levels of pain and fear and lower levels of knee function compared to controls. No differences were observed for H:M. ACLR individuals demonstrated higher AMT bilaterally and smaller MEPs in the injured limb, compared to the controls. ACLR participants demonstrated greater activation in frontal lobe areas responsible for motor and pain processing compared to controls, which were associated with self-reported pain. Our results suggest that individuals with ACLR demonstrate systemic neural differences compared to controls, which are observed concurrently with smaller quadriceps muscle volume, quadriceps muscle weakness, and self-reported dysfunction.",

      "# Title: Corticomotor function is associated with quadriceps rate of torque development in individuals with ACL surgery.\n# Abstract: Impaired corticomotor function arising from altered intracortical and corticospinal pathways are theorized to impede muscle recovery following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) surgery, yet functional implications of centrally driven adaptations remain unclear. We aimed to assess relationships between quadriceps corticomotor and neuromechanical function after ACL surgery, and to compare with contralateral and control limbs. 16 individuals after primary, unilateral ACL surgery and 16 sex- and age-matched controls participated. Corticomotor function was assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation, and quantified via active motor thresholds (AMT), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF). Neuromechanical function was quantified via electromechanical delay, early and late-phase rate of torque development (RTD0-50, RTD100-200), coefficient of variation, maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) torque, and central activation ratio. We observed significant correlations in the ACL limbs between: AMT and RTD0-50 (r = - 0.513, p = 0.031), SICI and RTD100-200 (r = 0.501, p = 0.048), AMT and SICI (r = - 0.659, p = 0.010), AMT and ICF (r = 0.579, p = 0.031), RTD0-50 and MVIC (r = 0.504, p = 0.023), and RTD100-200 and MVIC (r = 0.680, p = 0.002). The ACL limbs demonstrated higher AMT compared to controls (44.9 ± 8.4 vs. 30.1 ± 8.2%, p < 0.001), and lesser MVIC torque (2.37 ± 0.52 vs. 2.80 ± 0.59 Nm/kg, p = 0.005) and RTD100-200 (6.79 ± 1.72 vs. 7.90 ± 1.98 Nm/kg/s, p = 0.006) compared to the contralateral limbs. Our findings indicate that lesser corticospinal excitability is associated with lesser early-phase RTD, and greater intracortical inhibition is associated with lesser late-phase RTD. These findings provide evidence of implications of altered intracortical and corticospinal pathways relative to the ability to rapidly generate quadriceps torque following ACL surgery.",

      "# Title: Athletes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction demonstrate asymmetric intracortical facilitation early after surgery.\n# Abstract: Quadriceps dysfunction persists after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), yet the etiology remains elusive. Inhibitory and facilitatory intracortical networks (ie, intracortical excitability) may be involved in quadriceps dysfunction, yet the investigation of these networks early after ACLR is sparse. The purposes of this study were to examine (a) changes in intracortical excitability in athletes after ACLR compared to uninjured athletes during the course of postoperative rehabilitation, (b) the association between intracortical excitability and quadriceps strength in athletes after ACLR. Eighteen level I/II athletes after ACLR between the ages of 18 to 30 years and eighteen healthy sex, age, and activity matched athletes were tested at three-time points: (a) 2 weeks after surgery, (b) achievement of a \"quiet knee\" defined as full range of motion and minimal effusion, (c) return to running time point defined as achievement of a quadriceps index ≥80% and at least 12 weeks post-ACLR. Short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF), measured via transcranial magnetic stimulation and isometric quadriceps strength were examined bilaterally at each time point. There was a significant group × limb interaction (P = .017) for ICF. The ACLR group demonstrated asymmetric ICF (greater in the nonsurgical limb) compared to controls and a significant relationship between SICI and quadriceps strength of the surgical limb at the quiet knee time point (P = .018). ACLR individuals demonstrate differential effects on ICF between limbs. Also, SICI is associated with isometric quadriceps strength after ACLR, suggesting increased inhibition of the motor cortex may contribute to impaired quadriceps strength following ACLR.",

      "# Title: Neural activity for hip-knee control in those with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A task-based functional connectivity analysis.\n# Abstract: Anterior cruciate ligament injury may induce neurophysiological changes for sensorimotor control. Neuroimaging investigations have revealed unique brain activity patterns for knee movement following injury, indicating potential neural mechanisms underlying aberrant neuromuscular control that may contribute to heightened risk of secondary injury, altered movement patterns and poor patient outcomes. However, neuroimaging paradigms thus far have been limited to single joint, single motion knee tasks. Therefore, we sought to overcome prior limitations to understand the effects of injury on neural control of lower extremity movement by employing a multi-joint motor paradigm and determining differences in neural activity between ACL-reconstructed (ACLr) individuals relative to healthy matched controls. Fifteen patients with left anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and fifteen matched healthy controls participated in this study. Neural activity was examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging during a block-designed knee-hip movement paradigm (similar to a supine heel-slide). Participants for each group were monitored and task performance was controlled via a metronome to ensure the same spatial-temporal parameters. We observed that those with ACL reconstruction displayed increased activation within the intracalcarine cortex, lingual gyrus, occipital fusiform gyrus, lateral occipital cortex, angular gyrus, and superior parietal lobule relative to controls. A follow-up task-based functional connectivity analyses using seed regions identified from the group analysis revealed connectivity among fronto-insular-temporal and sensorimotor regions within the ACLr participants. The results of this fMRI investigation suggest ACLr individuals require increased activity and connectivity in areas responsible for visual-spatial cognition and orientation, and attention for hip and knee motor control."

Critically, these neurocognitive deficits directly correlate with poorer functional outcomes, including impaired balance, altered motor control, and increased risk of re-injury, highlighting the necessity of incorporating neurocognitive assessment and targeted rehabilitation strategies into the standard management of ACL injuries to optimize recovery and safe return to sport.",
      "conclusionB": "**Primary Concluding Statement:**\n\nIndividuals following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) demonstrate altered central nervous system excitability, specifically higher corticospinal excitability (higher RMT, greater MEP amplitudes) and asymmetric intracortical facilitation early post-surgery (2 weeks), which is associated with impaired quadriceps strength and function (lower rate of torque development). These neural differences persist over time and are associated with increased activation in brain regions related to motor control and pain processing, potentially contributing to quadriceps weakness and functional deficits."

      "# Title: Expression of a hepatitis A virus antigen in Lactococcus lactis and Escherichia coli and evaluation of its immunogenicity.\n# Abstract: An epidemic shift in Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection has been observed in recent years in rapidly developing countries, with increasing numbers of severe adult cases which has led to renewed interest in vaccination. Our approach in vaccine development uses recombinant expression of the highly immunogenic HAV antigen VP1-P2a in food-grade lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis and in Escherichia coli. We used genetic constructs that enable nisin-controlled expression of the antigen in L. lactis in three different forms: (a) intracellularly, (b) on the bacterial surface and (c) on the bacterial surface fused with the fragment of the E. coli flagellin molecule that can act as a molecular adjuvant. Expression of the two surface forms of the antigen was achieved in L. lactis, and the resulting antigen-displaying bacteria were administered orally to mice. Half the animals in each of the two groups developed specific IgGs, with titers increasing over time and reaching 1:422 without flagellin and 1:320 with flagellin. A much higher titer 1:25,803 was observed with the parenterally administered antigen, which was purified from E. coli. With the latter, a significant mucosal IgA response was also observed. Despite significant titers, the IgGs elicited with oral or parenteral administration could not prevent HAV from infecting cells in a virus neutralization assay, suggesting that the antibodies cannot recognize viral surface epitopes. Nevertheless, orally administered HAV antigen expressed in L. lactis elicited significant systemic humoral immune response showing the feasibility for development of effective HAV vaccine for mucosal delivery.",
      "# Title: Oral immunization with recombinant Lactococcus lactis delivering a multi-epitope antigen CTB-UE attenuates Helicobacter pylori infection in mice.\n# Abstract: Urease is an essential virulence factor and colonization factor for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and is considered as an excellent vaccine candidate antigen. However, conventional technologies for preparing an injectable vaccine require purification of the antigenic protein and preparation of an adjuvant. Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 (L. lactis) could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of edible vaccine. In previous study, we constructed a multi-epitope vaccine, designated CTB-UE, which is composed of the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), three Th cell epitopes and two B-cell epitopes from urease subunits. To develop a novel type of oral vaccine against H. pylori, genetically modified L. lactis strains were established to secrete this epitope vaccine extracellularly in this study. Oral prophylactic immunization with recombinant L. lactis significantly elicited humoral anti-urease antibody responses (P < 0.001) and reduced the gastric colonization of H. pylori from 7.14 ± 0.95 to 4.68 ± 0.98 log10 CFU g(-1) stomach. This L. lactis oral vaccine offers a promising vaccine candidate for the control of H. pylori infection.",
      "# Title: Development of a new DNA vaccine based on mycobacterial ESAT-6 antigen delivered by recombinant invasive Lactococcus lactis FnBPA+.\n# Abstract: The use of the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis as a vehicle for the oral delivery of DNA vaccine plasmids constitutes a promising strategy for vaccination. The delivery of DNA plasmids into eukaryotic cells is of critical importance for subsequent DNA expression and effectiveness of the vaccine. In this context, the use of the recombinant invasive L. lactis FnBPA+ (fibronectin-binding protein A) strain for the oral delivery of the eukaryotic expression vector vaccination using lactic acid bacteria (pValac), coding for the 6-kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6) gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, could represent a new DNA vaccine strategy against tuberculosis. To this end, the ESAT-6 sequence was cloned into the pValac vector; the L. lactis fibronectin-binding protein A (FnBPA)+ (pValac:ESAT-6) strain was obtained, and its immunological profile was checked in BALB/c mice. This strain was able to significantly increase interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production in spleen cells, showing a systemic T helper 1 (Th1) cell response. The mice also showed a significant increase in specific secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) production in colon tissue and fecal extracts. Thus, this is the first time that L. lactis has been used to deliver a plasmid DNA harboring a gene that encodes an antigen against tuberculosis through mucous membranes.",
      "# Title: Lactococcus lactis displayed neuraminidase confers cross protective immunity against influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Influenza A viruses pose a serious threat to public health. Current influenza A vaccines predominantly focus on hemagglutinin (HA) and show strain-specific protection. Neuraminidase (NA) is much less studied in the context of humoral immunity against influenza A viruses. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cross protective immunity of NA presented on Lactococcus lactis (L.lactis) surface against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in the mouse model. L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA was constructed in which pgsA was used as an anchor protein. Mice vaccinated orally with L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA could elicit significant NA-specific serum IgG and mucosa IgA antibodies, as well as neuraminidase inhibition (NI) titers. Importantly, L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA provided 80% protection against H5N1, 60% protection against H3N2 and H1N1, respectively. These findings suggest that recombinant L.lactis/pNZ110-pgsA-NA in the absence of adjuvant via oral administration can be served as an effective vaccine candidate against diverse strains of influenza A viruses.",
      "# Title: Broadly protective immunity against divergent influenza viruses by oral co-administration of Lactococcus lactis expressing nucleoprotein adjuvanted with cholera toxin B subunit in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines need to be annually reformulated to well match the predicated circulating strains. Thus, it is critical for developing a novel universal influenza vaccine that would be able to confer cross-protection against constantly emerging divergent influenza virus strains. Influenza virus A is a genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses. Influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) is a structural protein which encapsidates the negative strand viral RNA, and anti-NP antibodies play role in cross-protective immunity. Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) is an ideal vaccine delivery vehicle via oral administration route. However, L. lactis vectored vaccine exhibits poor immunogenicity without the use of mucosal adjuvant. To enhance the immunogenicity of L. lactis vectored vaccine, cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit, one of mucosal adjuvants, is a safe adjuvant for oral route, when combined with L. lactis vectored vaccine. In this study, we hypothesized that pNZ8008, a L. lactis expression plasmid, encoding NP antigen, would be able to elicit cross-protection with the use of CTB via oral administration route.",
      "# Title: Cross-protection of Lactococcus lactis-displayed HA2 subunit against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines provide strain-specific protection against homologous subtypes and need to be updated annually. Therefore, it is essential to develop a universal vaccine that would induce broadly cross-protective immunity against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses. The highly conserved HA2 subunit is a promising candidate for developing a universal influenza vaccine. Here, we hypothesized that the HA2 subunit could be displayed on the surface of Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis), using Spax as an anchor protein (L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2) and that L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 would have immunogenicity by oral administration without the use of adjuvant in the mouse model. To address this hypothesis, we show that oral vaccination of mice with L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 elicited significant humoral and mucosal immune responses. Importantly, L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 provided 100% protection against homologous H5N1 or heterologous H1N1 virus challenge. These results suggest that an HA2 subunit presented on the surface of L. lactis is an effective universal vaccine candidate against influenza A viruses in the poultry industry and in humans.",
      "# Title: Oral Immunization with a Recombinant Lactococcus lactis-Expressing HIV-1 Antigen on Group A Streptococcus Pilus Induces Strong Mucosal Immunity in the Gut.\n# Abstract: The induction of a potent humoral and cellular immune response in mucosal tissue is important for the development of an effective HIV vaccine. Most of the current HIV vaccines under development use the i.m. route for immunization, which is relatively poor in generating potent and long-lived mucosal immune responses. In this article, we explore the ability of an oral vaccination with a probiotic organism, Lactococcus lactis, to elicit HIV-specific immune responses in the mucosal and systemic compartments of BALB/c mice. We expressed the HIV-1 Gag-p24 on the tip of the T3 pilus of Streptococcus pyogenes as a fusion to the Cpa protein (LL-Gag). After four monthly LL-Gag oral immunizations, we observed strong Gag-specific IgG and IgA responses in serum, feces, and vaginal secretions. However, the Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses in the blood were at or below our detection limit. After an i.m. modified vaccinia Ankara/Gag boost, we observed robust Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses both in systemic and in mucosal tissues, including intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes of the small intestine, Peyer's patches, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Consistent with strong immunogenicity, the LL-Gag induced activation of CD11c(+) CD11b(+) dendritic cells in the Peyer's patches after oral immunization. Our results demonstrate that oral immunization with L. lactis expressing an Ag on the tip of the group A Streptococcus pilus serves as an excellent vaccine platform to induce strong mucosal humoral and cellular immunity against HIV.",

      "# Title: Production and delivery of Helicobacter pylori NapA in Lactococcus lactis and its protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity.\n# Abstract: Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein A subunit (NapA) has been identified as a virulence factor, a protective antigen and a potent immunomodulator. NapA shows unique application potentials for anti-H. pylori vaccines and treatment strategies of certain allergic diseases and carcinomas. However, appropriate production and utilization modes of NapA still remain uncertain to date. This work has established a novel efficient production and utilization mode of NapA by using L. lactis as an expression host and delivery vector, and demonstrated immune protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity of the engineered L. lactis by oral vaccination of mice. It was observed for the first time that H. pylori NapA promotes both polarized Th17 and Th1 responses, which may greatly affect the clinical application of NapA. This report offers a promising anti-H. pylori oral vaccine candidate and a potent mucosal immune modulatory agent. Meanwhile, it uncovers a way to produce and deliver the oral vaccine and immunomodulator by fermentation of food like milk, which might have striking effects on control of H. pylori infection, gastrointestinal cancers, and Th2 bias allergic diseases, including many food allergies.",
      "# Title: Protective immunity induced by an intranasal multivalent vaccine comprising 10 Lactococcus lactis strains expressing highly prevalent M-protein antigens derived from Group A Streptococcus.\n# Abstract: Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) causes diseases ranging from mild pharyngitis to severe invasive infections. The N-terminal fragment of streptococcal M protein elicits protective antibodies and is an attractive vaccine target. However, this N- terminal fragment is hypervariable: there are more than 200 different M types. In this study, an intranasal live bacterial vaccine comprising 10 strains of Lactococcus lactis, each expressing one N-terminal fragment of M protein, has been developed. Live bacterial-vectored vaccines cost less to manufacture because the processes involved are less complex than those required for production of protein subunit vaccines. Moreover, intranasal administration does not require syringes or specialized personnel. Evaluation of individual vaccine types (M1, M2, M3, M4, M6, M9, M12, M22, M28 and M77) showed that most of them protected mice against challenge with virulent S. pyogenes. All 10 strains combined in a 10-valent vaccine (M×10) induced serum and bronchoalveolar lavage IgG titers that ranged from three- to 10-fold those of unimmunized mice. After intranasal challenge with M28 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice was significantly higher than that of unimmunized mice. In contrast, when mice were challenged with M75 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice did not differ significantly from that of unimmunized mice. Mx-10 immunized mice had significantly less S. pyogenes in oropharyngeal washes and developed less severe disease symptoms after challenge than did unimmunized mice. Our L. lactis-based vaccine may provide an alternative solution to development of broadly protective group A streptococcal vaccines.",
      "# Title: Mucosal and systemic immune responses elicited by recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a fusion protein composed of pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin from Bordetella pertussis.\n# Abstract: We constructed a food-grade expression system harboring a F1S1 fusion protein of Bordetella pertussis to be produced in Lactococcus lactis NZ3900 as a new oral vaccine model against whooping cough, caused by B. pertussis. F1S1 was composed of N-terminally truncated S1 subunit of pertussis toxin and type I immunodominant domain of filamentous hemagglutinin which are both known as protective immunogens against pertussis. The recombinant L. lactis was administered via oral or intranasal routes to BALB/c mice and the related specific systemic and mucosal immune responses were then evaluated. The results indicated significantly higher levels of specific IgA in the lung extracts and IgG in sera of mucosally-immunized mice, compared to their controls. It was revealed that higher levels of IgG2a, compared to IgG1, were produced in all mucosally-immunized mice. Moreover, immunized mice developed Th1 responses with high levels of IFN-γ production by the spleen cells. These findings provide evidence for L. lactis to be used as a suitable vehicle for expression and delivery of F1S1 fusion protein to mucosa and induction of appropriate systemic and mucosal immune responses against pertussis.",
      "# Title: Rotavirus VP6 protein mucosally delivered by cell wall-derived particles from Lactococcus lactis induces protection against infection in a murine model.\n# Abstract: Rotaviruses are the primary cause of acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide. Although the implementation of live attenuated vaccines has reduced the number of rotavirus-associated deaths, variance in their effectiveness has been reported in different countries. This fact, among other concerns, leads to continuous efforts for the development of new generation of vaccines against rotavirus.In this work, we describe the obtention of cell wall-derived particles from a recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a cell wall-anchored version of the rotavirus VP6 protein. After confirming by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, flow cytometry and electronic immunomicroscopy that these particles were carrying the VP6 protein, their immunogenic potential was evaluated in adult BALB/c mice. For that, mucosal immunizations (oral or intranasal), with or without the dmLT [(double mutant Escherichia coli heat labile toxin LT(R192G/L211A)] adjuvant were performed. The results showed that these cell wall-derived particles were able to generate anti-rotavirus IgG and IgA antibodies only when administered intranasally, whether the adjuvant was present or not. However, the presence of dmLT was necessary to confer protection against rotavirus infection, which was evidenced by a 79.5 percent viral shedding reduction.In summary, this work describes the production of cell wall-derived particles which were able to induce a protective immune response after intranasal immunization. Further studies are needed to characterize the immune response elicited by these particles as well as to determine their potential as an alternative to the use of live L. lactis for mucosal antigen delivery.",

The CDC estimates that every year 21 million individuals suffer from HuNoV-induced gastroenteritis in the United States. Currently, there is no FDA-approved vaccine for HuNoVs. Development of an effective vaccine has been hampered by the lack of an efficient cell culture system for HuNoVs and a suitable small animal model for pathogenesis study. In this study, we developed lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as a vector to deliver HuNoV antigen. A LAB strain (Lactococcus lactis) carrying VP1 gene of a HuNoV GII.4 virus (LAB-VP1) was constructed. It was found that HuNoV VP1 protein was highly expressed by LAB vector and was secreted into media supernatants. To test whether LAB-based HuNoV vaccine candidate is immunogenic, 4-day-old gnotobiotic piglets were orally inoculated with various doses of LAB-VP1. It was found that LABs were persistent in the small intestine of piglets and shed in pig feces for at least 25 days post inoculation. LAB DNA and VP1 were detected in mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen tissue in LAB-VP1 inoculated groups. HuNoV-specific IgG and IgA were detectable in serum and feces respectively at day 13 post-inoculation, and further increased at later time points. After being challenged with HuNoV GII.4 strain, a large amount of HuNoV antigens were observed in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum sections of the intestine in the LAB control group. In contrast, significantly less, or no, HuNoV antigens were detected in the LAB-VP1 immunized groups. Collectively, these results demonstrate that a LAB-based HuNoV vaccine induces protective immunity in gnotobiotic piglets.",

      "# Title: Mucosal Vaccination with Lactococcus lactis-Secreting Surface Immunological Protein Induces Humoral and Cellular Immune Protection against Group B Streptococcus in a Murine Model.\n# Abstract: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the primary etiological agent of sepsis and meningitis in newborns and is associated with premature birth and stillbirth. The development of a licensed vaccine is one of the pending challenges for the World Health Organization. Previously, we showed that oral immunization with surface immune protein (SIP) decreases vaginal colonization of GBS and generates functional opsonizing antibodies, which was determined by opsonophagocytic assays (OPA) in vitro. We also showed that the protein has an adjuvant vaccine profile. Therefore, an oral vaccine based on SIP may be an attractive alternative to employ in the development of new vaccines against GBS. Lactococcus lactis is a highlighted oral vaccine probiotic inducer of the mucosal immune response. This bacterium could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of an edible vaccine and has been used in clinical trials. In this study, we showed that an oral vaccine with a recombinant L. lactis strain secreting SIP from GBS (rL. lactis-SIP) can induce protective humoral and cellular immunity in an experimental model of GBS vaginal colonization in C57BL/6 mice. Mice immunized with rL. lactis-SIP were protected against clinical symptoms and bacterial colonization after GBS vaginal colonization. Our rL. lactis-SIP vaccine also induces an increase of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) specifically against SIP. The adoptive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice to naïve mice generated protection against GBS vaginal colonization. Moreover, the rL. lactis-SIP strain induces the activation of SIP-specific T cells, which could decrease GBS vaginal colonization and generate protective antibodies when transferred to other mice. Our experimental observations strongly support the notion that rL. lactis-SIP induces protective humoral and cellular immunity and could be considered as a novel alternative in the development of vaccines for GBS.",
      "# Title: Recombinant Lactococcus Lactis Displaying Omp31 Antigen of Brucella melitensis Can Induce an Immunogenic Response in BALB/c Mice.\n# Abstract: Since Brucella infection mostly occurs through the mucosal surfaces, immune response induced by vaccine that is delivered by a way of mucosal route can be drastically enhanced to control the brucellosis. Omp31is the major outer membrane protein of Brucella, and is considered as a protective antigen against Brucella infection. Accordingly, Lactococcus lactis has been used as an antigen-delivering vector to develop a vaccine-induced mucosal response for having a safer vaccination against brucellosis. A designed omp31 gene fused to the usp45 signal peptide and M6 cell wall anchor was sub cloned in the pNZ7021 expression vector, and a recombinant L. lactis displaying Omp31 was constructed. Omp31 protein expression was confirmed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. Animals were orally and intraperitoneally immunized with live or killed L. lactis expressing Omp31, respectively. The humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated by measuring the specific cytokines and antibodies. sIgA, serum IgA, IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in the mice immunized with live recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31 and also serum IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in mice immunized with killed recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31. Among IgG subtypes, IgG2a response was significantly higher in both groups compared to IgG1. In mice groups immunized with recombinant L. lactis, the IFN-γ and IL-10 level elevated; however, there was no change in the level of IL-4. These results indicated that recombinants L. lactis induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, and also vaccines based on L. lactis-derived live carriers are promising interventions against Brucella melitensis infections.",
      "# Title: Lactococcus lactis FNBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) Induces Cellular and Humoral Immune Responses After Oral Immunization of Mice.\n# Abstract: The development of a new vaccine strategy against tuberculosis is urgently needed and has been greatly encouraged by the scientific community worldwide. In this work, we constructed a lactococcal DNA vaccine based on the fusion of two Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens, ESAT-6 and Ag85A, and examined its immunogenicity. The coding sequences of the ESAT-6 and Ag85A genes were fused and cloned into the eukaryotic expression pValac vector, and the functionality of the vector was confirmed in vitro. Then, L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) was obtained and used for oral immunization of mice. This strain induced significant increases in IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-17 cytokines in stimulated splenocyte cultures, and significant production of antigen-specific sIgA was observed in the colonic tissues of immunized mice. We demonstrated that L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) generated a cellular and humoral immune response after oral immunization of mice. The strategy developed in this work may represent an interesting DNA mucosal vaccine candidate against tuberculosis, using the fusion of two highly immunogenic antigens delivered by safe lactic acid bacteria.",
      "# Title: Protective Immunity Against Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli by Oral Vaccination of Engineered Lactococcus lactis.\n# Abstract: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the leading causes of diarrhea in children globally, and thus suitable vaccines are desired. Antigen display on lactic acid bacteria is a reliable approach for efficient oral vaccination and preventing bowel diseases. To develop an oral vaccine against ETEC, the gene of the binding domain from heat-labile toxin (LTB), a key ETEC virulence factor, was codon-optimized and cloned into a construct containing a signal peptide and an anchor for display on L. lactis. Bioinformatics analysis showed a codon adaptation index of 0.95 for the codon-optimized gene. Cell surface expression of LTB was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and blotting. White New Zealand rabbits were immunized per os (PO) with the recombinant L. lactis, and the antibody titers were assayed with ELISA. In vitro neutralization assay was performed using mouse adrenal tumor cells and rabbit ileal loop test was performed as the in vivo assay. ELISA results indicated that oral administration of the engineered L. lactis elicited a significant production of IgA in the intestine. In vitro neutralization assay showed that the effect of the toxin could be neutralized with 500 µg/ml of IgG isolated from the oral vaccine group. Furthermore, the dose of ETEC causing fluid accumulation in the ileal loop test showed a tenfold increase in rabbits immunized with either recombinant L. lactis or LTB protein compared to other groups. Our results imply that recombinant L. lactis could potentially be an effective live oral vaccine against ETEC toxicity.",
      "# Title: Oral Immunization of Mice with Cell Extracts from Recombinant Lactococcus lactis Expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein.\n# Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all over the world and became a pandemic that named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). At present, several intramuscular vaccines have been successfully developed and mass vaccination has progressed in many countries. The aim of the study is to develop and examine an oral vaccine against COVID-19 with recombinant Lactococcus lactis IL1403, a strain of lactic acid bacteria, expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) S1 subunit as an immunizing antigen. PBS or cell extracts from recombinant L. lactis were orally administered into mice (control VS treatment), and formation of antigen-specific antibodies and changes in the gut microbiome were analyzed. Intracellular antigen was detected, but its secretion was not successful. After immunization, antigen-specific serum IgG and fecal IgA levels were 1.5-fold (P = 0.002) and 1.4-fold (P = 0.016) higher in the immunized mice (treatment) than control, respectively. Gut microbiome profiles were clearly separated between the two groups when analyzed for beta diversity with overall similarity. At the genus level, while Coprococcus (P = 0.036) and unclassified genus of Ruminococcaceae (P = 0.037) in treatment were more abundant than control, rc4-4 (P = 0.013) and Stenotrophomonas (P = 0.021) were less abundant. Our results indicate that cell extract containing SARS-CoV-2 antigen can induce mice to produce antigen-specific antibodies without overall changes in the gut microbiome. This strategy may be useful for the development of other oral viral vaccines.",
      "# Title: Oral Immunization With a M Cell-Targeting Recombinant L. Lactis Vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE Stimulate Protective Immunity Against H. Pylori in Mice.\n# Abstract: There are many virulence factors of H. pylori that contribute in diverse ways to gastric disease. Therefore, designing multivalent epitope vaccines against many key virulence factors virulence factors of H. pylori is a promising strategy to control H. pylori infection. In previous studies, we constructed a multivalent epitope vaccine FVpE against four key virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), and oral immunization with the FVpE vaccine plus a polysaccharide adjuvant (PA) containing lycium barbarum polysaccharide and chitosan could provide protection against H. pylori infection in the Mongolian gerbil model. Oral vaccines have many advantages over injected vaccines, such as improved safety and compliance, and easier manufacturing and administration. However, the harsh gastrointestinal (GI) environment, such as gastric acid and proteolytic enzymes, limits the development of oral vaccines to some extent. Oral vaccines need a gastrointestinal delivery system with high safety, low price and promoting vaccine antigen to stimulate immune response in the gastrointestinal mucosa. Lactic acid bacteria are gastrointestinal probiotics that have unique advantages as a delivery system for oral vaccines. In this study, a M cell-targeting surface display system for L. lactis named plSAM was designed to help vaccine antigens to stimulate effective immune responses in the gastrointestinal tract, and a M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE was constructed by using the surface display system plSAM. recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE could secretively express the SAM-FVpE protein and display it on the bacterial surface. Moreover, experimental results confirmed that LL-plSAM-FVpE had an enhanced M cell-targeting property. In addition, LL-plSAM-FVpE had excellent M cell-targeting property to promote the phagocytosis and transport of the antigen SAM-FVpE by gastrointestinal M cells. More importantly, oral immunization of LL-plSAM-FVpE or SAM-FVpE plus PA can stimulate IgG and sIgA antibodies and CD4+ T cell immune responses against four virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), thus providing protective immunity against H. pylori infection in mice. The M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine against various key H. pylori virulence factors could be a promising vaccine candidate for controlling H. pylori infection.",
      "# Title: Oral and intranasal immunization with food-grade recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing high conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein triggers mice's immunity responses.\n# Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic began at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread throughout the world. Vaccination is still the most effective method of prevention of pathogenic infections, including viral infections. However, there is little evidence that vaccination can protect against SARS-CoV-2 virus for a long time. Thus, regular re-vaccination is necessary to control COVID-19. Vaccination by injection is invasive, and is one of the reasons people refuse to get re-vaccinated. Therefore, we developed a less invasive vaccine based on oral or nasal administration. The gene encoding the high conserved region (HCR) spike protein was inserted into pNZ8149 and expressed in L.lactis NZ3900. Mice were immunized at 3-week intervals with oral or nasal routes. Anti-SARS-CoV2 spike antibody (IgG and IgA) level were measured using ELISA method before and after treatment. Plasma cells population in lymph were analyzed using flowcytometry and the CD4 + and CD8 + cells in lymph and intestine were analyzed using immunofluorescence method. The results of nasal and oral administration in experimental animals showed that L.lactis carrying the HCR gene could induce a humoral immune response, as indicated by increased levels of IgG and IgA against SARS-CoV-2 (IgG/IgA-SARS-CoV-2). The plasma cell population after nasal and oral vaccination in mice were significantly different with control group (p < 0.05). The CD4 + and CD8 + cells in intestine were significantly higher in orally immunized group mice than control group. The CD8 + cells in lymph were significantly higher in intranasal immunized group mice than control group. Our data demonstrate L.lactis expressing spike protein can be developed into a less invasive alternative to nasal and oral vaccination.",
      "# Title: Expanding strain coverage of a group A Streptococcus pilus-expressing Lactococcus lactis mucosal vaccine.\n# Abstract: Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a human pathogenic bacterium that can trigger a wide range of diseases, including the autoimmune diseases acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, causing major morbidity and mortality in many low- and middle-income countries. Primary intervention programs have had limited success thus far, and a licensed vaccine has yet to be developed. The pilus of GAS is known to be involved in host cell adhesion, biofilm formation and immune evasion. We have a mucosal vaccine in development that expresses the pilus of GAS on the surface of the nonpathogenic bacterium Lactococcus lactis. To expand strain coverage, we combined seven L. lactis constructs, each expressing a different GAS pilus variant, and investigated the systemic and mucosal immune responses following immunization. Mice immunized with this combination showed specific immunoglobin G and immunoglobin A responses to the GAS pilus proteins of vaccine strains, at levels comparable to mice immunized with a single construct. Cross-reactivity to pilus proteins of nonvaccine strains was also evident. Furthermore, protective efficacy against a homologous strain of GAS in a murine nasopharyngeal colonization model was observed. Overall, this study provides further evidence for using pilus-expressing lactic acid bacteria as a vaccine to prevent upper respiratory tract GAS infections."

We examined WFA+ -M2BP levels in patients with F4 (cirrhosis), F3 or more (advanced fibrosis) and F2 or more (significant fibrosis) in the two groups. We further examined the relationship between five fibrosis markers and the degree of fibrosis. The WFA+ -M2BP values ranged from 0.25 cut-off index (COI) to 12.9 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 0.34-20.0 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P<.0001). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F4 in the two groups were 2.83 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 5.03 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P=.0046). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F3 or more in the two groups were 1.79 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 3.79 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P<.0001). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F2 or more in the two groups were 1.49 COI in the hepatitis B cohort and 3.19 COI in the hepatitis C group (P<.0001). Among five liver fibrosis markers, WFA+ -M2BP had the highest correlation coefficient (rs =.629) in terms of correlation with the degree of fibrosis in the patients with hepatitis C and had the second highest rs value (.415) in the hepatitis B group. Although WFA+ -M2BP could be a useful indicator of liver fibrosis, WFA+ -M2BP levels in the two groups significantly differed even in the same degree of fibrosis. Individual cut-off values in each aetiology for the degree of fibrosis should be determined.",

Consecutive adult NAFLD patients who had a liver biopsy were included. Serum WFA+-M2BP level was measured using a lectin-antibody sandwich immunoassay using a chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay machine (HISCL-5000, Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). The measured levels were indexed using the following equation: Cut-off index (COI) = ([WFA+-M2BP]sample-[WFA+-M2BP]NC) / ([WFA+-M2BP]PC-[WFA+-M2BP]NC), where PC = positive control and NC = negative control. Histopathological examination of liver biopsy specimen was reported according to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Clinical Research Network Scoring System. Data for 220 cases were analyzed. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of NASH was 0.65. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of steatosis grade ≥2 and 3 was 0.64 and 0.53, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of lobular inflammation grade ≥1, ≥2 and 3 was 0.57, 0.68 and 0.59, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of hepatocyte ballooning grade ≥1 and 2 was 0.64 and 0.65, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of fibrosis stage ≥1, ≥2, ≥3 and 4 was 0.61, 0.71, 0.74 and 0.84, respectively. Out of the 220 cases, 152 cases were the same 76 patients who had a repeat liver biopsy after 48 weeks of intervention. The AUROC of the change in the COI to detect improvement in steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning and fibrosis was 0.57, 0.54, 0.59 and 0.52, respectively. In conclusion, serum WFA+-M2BP was most useful for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in NAFLD patients. However, it was less useful for differentiating NASH from non-NASH, and for diagnosis and follow-up of the individual histopathological components of NASH.",

We assessed its efficacy in evaluating liver disease severity in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in Taiwan. The association between WFA+-M2BP and histological features was evaluated among those CHC patients underwent liver biopsy. We also aimed to clarify the factors determining the performance of WFA+-M2BP in CHC. A total of 229 CHC patients were consecutively recruited. The mean value of WFA+-M2BP in patients from F0 to F4 was 1.68, 2.23, 3.45, 3.48, 3.77 respectively (linear trend P = 0.008). Linear regression analysis revealed that alanine aminotransferase (odds ratio [OR]: 0.03, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.02-0.05, P < 0.001), AST (OR: -0.1, 95% CI: -0.02 to -0.01, P < 0.001), and liver fibrosis (OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.01-0.59, P = 0.043) were the independent factors correlated to serum WFA+-M2BP level. The optimal cutoff values of WFA+-M2BP for fibrosis stages F1, F2, F3, and F4 were 1.42, 1.61, 1.42, and 2.67, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the platelet count (OR/CI: -0.009/0.986-0.996, P = <0.001), r-glutamyl transferase (OR/CI: 0.007/1.000-1.013, P = 0.036), and WFA+-M2BP (OR/CI: 0.187/1.057-1.374, P = 0.005).

      "# Title: Comparison of serum fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B.\n# Abstract: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The diagnosis of liver fibrosis has a key role in selecting patients with CHB for antiviral treatment. However, serum biomarkers demonstrate limited diagnostic utility. The present study aimed to compare the performances of fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB and to identify the most appropriate biomarker for these patients. The current study included 96 antiviral-naïve patients with CHB who underwent liver biopsy. METAVIR scoring system was used to assess liver fibrosis and necroinflammation. The diagnostic performances were evaluated of the platelet (PLT) count; the levels of hyaluronan, serum 7S domain of type 4 collagen, procollagen type III N-terminal peptide, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1, Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) and N-terminal type III collagen propeptide (Pro-C3); the fibrosis index based on four factors; the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index; and enhanced liver fibrosis score for identifying significant liver fibrosis [≥fibrosis stage 2 (F2)]. All fibrosis biomarkers, except the Pro-C3 level, correlated with the fibrosis stage. M2BPGi was better than other biomarkers for diagnosing ≥F2, with the highest area under the curve of 0.902. M2BPGi demonstrated a higher diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis than mild/severe fibrosis or cirrhosis. However, no significant correlation was observed between the M2BPGi level and fibrosis stage in patients with CHB having significant liver necroinflammation defined as ≥ necroinflammatory activity 2. The M2BPGi level and PLT count were exclusively correlated with the fibrosis stage in 73 patients without significant liver necroinflammation. M2BPGi demonstrated the highest diagnostic performance for significant fibrosis in patients having significant liver fibrosis with no significant liver necroinflammation. In conclusion, the M2BPGi level can accurately diagnose significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB.",

A randomized, single-blind study was performed to evaluate the effects of the combination of high-dose furosemide and small-volume hypertonic saline solution (HSS) infusion in the treatment of refractory New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV CHF and a normosodic diet during follow-up. Materials and Methods One hundred seven patients (39 women and 68 men, age range 65-90 years) with refractory CHF (NYHA class IV) of different etiologies, who were unresponsive to high oral doses of furosemide, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digitalis, and nitrates, were enrolled. Inclusion criteria included an ejection fraction (EF) <35%, serum creatinine level <2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level < or =60 mg/dL, reduced urinary volume, and low natriuresis. The patients were randomized in 2 groups (single-blind). Patients in group 1 (20 women and 33 men) received an intravenous (IV) infusion of furosemide (500-1000 mg) plus HSS (150 mL of 1.4%-4.6% NACl) twice a day in 30 minutes. Patients in group 2 (19 women and 35 men) received an IV bolus of furosemide (500-1000 mg) twice a day, without HSS, during a period lasting 6 to 12 days. Both groups received IV KCl (20-40 mEq) to prevent hypokalemia. At study entry, all patients underwent a physical examination and measurement of body weight (BW), blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR), an evaluation of signs of CHF, and measurement of control levels of serum Na, K, Cl, bicarbonate, albumin, uric acid, creatinine, urea, and glycemia daily during hospitalization, and measurements of the daily output of urine for Na, K, and Cl. A chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram were obtained at study entry, during hospitalization, and at the time of discharge from the hospital. During the treatment and after discharge, the daily dietary Na intake was 120 mmol in group 1 versus 80 mmol in group 2, with a fluid intake of 1000 mL daily in both groups. An assessment of BW and 24-hour urinary volume, serum, and urinary laboratory parameters were performed daily until patients reached a compensated state, when IV furosemide was replaced with oral administration (250-500 mg/d). After discharge from the hospital, patients were observed as outpatients weekly for the first 3 months and, subsequently, once a month.",

      "# Title: Impact of Compound Hypertonic Saline Solution on Decompensated Heart Failure.\n# Abstract: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of hypertonic saline solution (C-HSS) with high dose furosemide on hospitalization time, readmission, and mortality in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III heart failure.Decompensated heart failure patients (NYHA III) with chronic ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy and ejection fraction < 40% were divided into 2 groups in an open-label random manner: the first group received a 1-hour intravenous infusion of furosemide (100 mg) plus compound C-HSS (100 mL) twice daily and underwent serious water restriction (500 mL/day); the second group received furosemide intravenous bolus (100 mg) twice a day and water restriction (500 mL/day), without C-HSS. Both groups had normal sodium (120 mmol sodium) intake. After discharge, the two groups continued to receive 120 mmol Na/day and 500-1000 mL water/day.The first group (132 C-HSS patients) had an increase in urination, a reduction in hospitalization time (4 ± 2 versus 7 ± 2 days, P < 0.01), and a reduction in hospitalization costs (2210 RMB versus 3506 RMB, P < 0.01) compared with the second group (132 without C-HSS patients). During the follow-up period (36 ± 12 months), the first group had a significantly higher average readmission time (31.84 ± 7.58 months versus 15.60 ± 6.25 months, P < 0.01) and lower mortality rate (16.5% versus 31.9%, P < 0.01).The results suggest that periodical C-HSS administration, combined with serious water restriction and a normal sodium diet, significantly reduces the hospitalization time, readmission rate, and mortality in patients with NYHA class III HF."

      "conclusionA": "While intuitively appealing, the addition of hypertonic saline to furosemide in acute heart failure does not consistently improve renal function or mortality, and is most likely to offer benefit – with careful monitoring – only in a select subgroup of patients with reduced ejection fraction exhibiting diuretic resistance and signs of pre-renal azotemia; its use is generally not recommended in patients with preserved ejection fraction or established cardiorenal syndrome.",

      "# Title: What determines and are the consequences of surveillance intensity after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair?\n# Abstract: Follow-up examinations are advised 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months and yearly thereafter by the European Collaborating Group on Stent-Graft Techniques for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair (EUROSTAR). The aim of this study was to evaluate the determinants and consequences of surveillance completeness. Patients who underwent endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair between October 1996 and August 2004 and enrolled in the EUROSTAR registry were analyzed. Two groups were compared: patients who attended all scheduled visits (group A) and those who came infrequently (group B). Odds ratios and hazard rates (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined to detect which patient characteristics and complications were associated with follow-up intensity. Of the 4,433 patients, 1,538 (35%) attended all scheduled visits until the end of follow-up (group A). Analysis of patient characteristics demonstrated that intensive visitors were more often smokers, hyperlipemic, and considered unfit for open surgery or general anesthesia. Complications during follow-up, including endoleaks (24% vs. 20%), kinking (3.5% vs. 2.5%), and migration (4.9% vs. 3.5%), appeared significantly more frequently in group A. Despite intensive follow-up of this category, still a greater proportion died (12% vs. 9%, adjusted HR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.8). After 84 months of follow-up, the cumulative survival rates in groups A and B were 71% and 74%, respectively (p < 0.0001). It seems that follow-up intensity was based on baseline patient characteristics. High-risk patients had, despite more intensive surveillance, still more complications after adjustment for patient, morphological, and center-specific characteristics. Further assessment is indicated to evaluate the effectiveness of different frequencies of surveillance visits.",

      "conclusionA": "While surveillance is a valid management strategy for unruptured intracranial aneurysms, its benefit is significantly modified by patient and aneurysm characteristics; **personalized risk stratification – integrating aneurysm size and growth rate, neck morphology, and underlying patient comorbidities – is essential to optimize outcomes, shifting from surveillance to intervention based on individual risk profiles rather than a uniform approach.**",
      "conclusionB": "Despite more intensive imaging surveillance—defined as attendance at all scheduled follow-up visits—patients undergoing endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair exhibited a significantly higher adjusted hazard of mortality (HR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.8) and a trend towards increased post-operative complications, suggesting that increased surveillance frequency does not improve outcomes and may identify a higher-risk cohort."

We extracted data from 23 peer-reviewed studies. Prevalence of torture, variably defined, was above 30% across all studies. Torture history in clinic populations correlated with hunger and posttraumatic stress disorder, although in small, nonrepresentative samples.

Limited evidence suggests that asylum seekers frequently experience violence and health problems, but large-scale studies are needed to inform policies and services for this vulnerable group often at the center of political debate.",
      "# Title: Sexual and reproductive health of migrants: does the EU care?\n# Abstract: The European Union (EU) refers to health as a human right in many internal and external communications, policies and agreements, defending its universality. In parallel, specific health needs of migrants originating from outside the EU have been acknowledged. Yet, their right to health and in particular sexual and reproductive health (SRH) is currently not ensured throughout the EU. This paper reflects on the results of a comprehensive literature review on migrants' SRH in the EU applying the Critical Interpretive Synthesis review method. We highlight the discrepancy between a proclaimed rights-based approach to health and actual obstacles to migrants' attainment of good SRH. Uncertainties on entitlements of diverse migrant groups are fuelled by unclear legal provisions, creating significant barriers to access health systems in general and SRH services in particular. Furthermore, the rare strategies addressing migrants' health fail to address sexual health and are generally limited to perinatal care and HIV screening. Thus, future European public health policy-making should not only strongly encourage its Member States to ensure equal access to health care for migrants as for EU citizens, but also promote migrants' SRH effectively through a holistic and inclusive approach in SRH policies, prevention and care.",
      "# Title: Evaluating the impact of immigration policies on health status among undocumented immigrants: a systematic review.\n# Abstract: Over the past two decades, new anti-immigration policies and laws have emerged to address the migration of undocumented immigrants. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to assess and understand how these immigration policies and laws may affect both access to health services and health outcomes among undocumented immigrants. Eight databases were used to conduct this review, which returned 325 papers that were assessed for validity based on specified inclusion criteria. Forty critically appraised articles were selected for analysis; thirty articles related to access to health services, and ten related to health outcomes. The articles showed a direct relationship between anti-immigration policies and their effects on access to health services. In addition, as a result of these policies, undocumented immigrants were impacted by mental health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Action items were presented, including the promotion of cultural diversity training and the development of innovative strategies to support safety-net health care facilities serving vulnerable populations.",

A large number of barriers and facilitators to HIV testing were identified across the individual, social and structural levels. A number of study design and methodological issues, however, inhibited a comprehensive synthesis. There is no doubt that addressing HIV testing in migrants in high-income countries is complex; however, it has important implications for individual, community and population health, and a strong, empirically based response is warranted.",

      "# Title: What the eye does not see: a critical interpretive synthesis of European Union policies addressing sexual violence in vulnerable migrants.\n# Abstract: In Europe, refugees, asylum seekers and undocumented migrants are more vulnerable to sexual victimisation than European citizens. They face more challenges when seeking care. This literature review examines how legal and policy frameworks at national, European and international levels condition the prevention of and response to sexual violence affecting these vulnerable migrant communities living in the European Union (EU). Applying the Critical Interpretive Synthesis method, we reviewed 187 legal and policy documents and 80 peer-reviewed articles on migrant sexual health for elements on sexual violence and further analysed the 37 legal and 12 peer-reviewed articles among them that specifically focused on sexual violence in vulnerable migrants in the EU-27 States. Legal and policy documents dealing with sexual violence, particularly but not exclusively in vulnerable migrants, apply 'tunnel vision'. They ignore: a) frequently occurring types of sexual violence, b) victimisation rates across genders and c) specific risk factors within the EU such as migrants' legal status, gender orientation and living conditions. The current EU policy-making paradigm relegates sexual violence in vulnerable migrants as an 'outsider' and 'female only' issue while EU migration and asylum policies reinforce its invisibility. Effective response must be guided by participatory rights- and evidence-based policies and a public health approach, acknowledging the occurrence and multiplicity of sexual victimisation of vulnerable migrants of all genders within EU borders.",

A scoping literature review approach was used to systematically search nursing, medical, psychological, law, and international databases and synthesize information on a complex, understudied topic. The search yielded 826 articles, and 39 met the predetermined criteria for inclusion in the review. Trafficking in Ethiopia has occurred internally and externally in the form of adult and child labor and sex trafficking. There were also some reports of organ trafficking and other closely related human rights violations, such as child marriage, child soldiering, and exploitative intercountry adoption. Risk factors for trafficking included push factors (poverty, political instability, economic problems, and gender discrimination) and pull factors (demand for cheap labor). Trafficking was associated with poor health and economic outcomes for victims. Key recommendations for service delivery, research and training, and policy are identified, including establishing comprehensive services for survivor rehabilitation and reintegration, conducting quantitative health outcomes research, and reforming policy around migration and trafficking. Implementing the recommendations identified by this review will allow policy makers, researchers, and practitioners to take meaningful steps toward confronting human trafficking in Ethiopia.",

      "# Title: Factors Influencing the Accuracy of Infectious Disease Reporting in Migrants: A Scoping Review.\n# Abstract: We conducted a scoping review of literature to improve our understanding of the accuracy of infectious disease monitoring in migrants in the Europe. We searched PubMed for papers relevant to the topic including: case reports, observational and experimental studies, reviews, guidelines or policy documents; published after 1994. We identified 532 papers, 27 of which were included in the review. Legislation and right to access health care influence both the accuracy of rates and risk measures under estimating the at risk population, i.e., the denominator. Furthermore, the number of reported cases, i.e., the numerator, may also include cases not accounted for in the denominator. Both biases lead to an overestimated disease occurrence. Restriction to healthcare access and low responsiveness may cause under-detection of cases, however a quantification of this phenomenon has not been produced. On the contrary, screening for asymptomatic diseases increases ascertainment leading to increased detection of cases. Incompleteness of denominator data underestimates the at-risk population. In conclusion, most studies show a lower probability of under-reporting infectious diseases in migrants compared with native populations."

      "# Title: Nutritional care; do process and structure indicators influence malnutrition prevalence over time?\n# Abstract: To date, no information is available about the effect of structural and process factors of nutritional care on the prevalence of malnutrition over time in the long-term care sector. This study analyzes the trend of malnutrition prevalence rates between 2007 and 2011 in the long-term care sector, and the related effects of(1) process indicators such as nutritional screening and treatment and 2) structural indicators (guideline, protocol or nutritional screening policy). From 2007 to 2011, the Dutch National Prevalence Measurement of Care Problems (LPZ) was performed in Dutch long-term care organizations using a standardized questionnaire involving measurements at institutional, ward and resident level. The data were analyzed by mixed-linear regression for longitudinal data. Presence of malnutrition was assessed by BMI, undesired weight loss and nutritional intake. Seventy-four care homes were included (26,101 residents). The malnutrition prevalence trend significantly decreased (P < 0.001) from 26% to 18% from 2007 to 2011. In the final model of the mixed effects analysis only the interacted process indicators nutritional screening and oral nutritional supplementation (ONS) were significant in influencing malnutrition prevalence rates over time. Structural indicators had no impact on the malnutrition prevalence over time. In conclusion, over time a lower prevalence of malnutrition is associated with a higher degree of nutritional screening. As might be expected, a higher prevalence of malnutrition is associated with higher use of ONS. Structural nutritional screening is an important intervention to tackle the problem of malnutrition in the long term care sector.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether resident characteristics influence possible differences in malnutrition prevalence between countries. The study followed a cross-sectional, multi-centre design that measured malnutrition in nursing home residents from The Netherlands, Germany and Austria. Resident data were gathered using a standardised questionnaire. Malnutrition was operationalised using BMI, unintentional weight loss and nutritional intake. Data were analysed using an association model. The prevalence rates of malnutrition in The Netherlands, Germany and Austria were 18·3, 20·1 and 22·5 %, respectively. The multivariate generalised estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression analysis showed that sex, age, care dependency, the mean number of diseases and some specific diseases were influencing factors for whether the resident was malnourished or not. The OR of malnutrition in the three countries declined after including the influencing factors resulting from the multivariate GEE analysis.

    "referenceConclusion": "Pre-conditioning significantly reduced the severity of creatine kinase release, delayed-onset muscle soreness, loss of maximal voluntary contraction force and the range of motion decrease. Pre-conditioning may prevent severe EIMD and accelerate recovery of muscle force generation capacity. The current systematic review identified that pre-conditioning activities are effective in attenuating EIMD measures, CK, muscle soreness, ROM and maximal voluntary force production. These findings suggest the use of pre-conditioning activities prior to a strenuous bout of exercise does provide a significant protective effect when performed a minimum of 24 h prior to the damaging stimulus. Furthermore, the greater improvement in MVC suggests that the pre-conditioning activities may accelerate the recovery of muscle contractile properties following strenuous exercises. However, it is unclear if pre-conditioning would prevent EIMD from more complex exercises or to what extent EIMD prevention carries over into other modes of exercise.",

      "# Title: Muscle tenderness and peak torque changes after downhill running following a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: Unaccustomed exercise (usually of an eccentric nature) is often followed by delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Previous studies have found that prior eccentric activity produces a training effect which reduces DOMS and morphological changes. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a prior bout of maximal isokinetic eccentric exercise on DOMS, strength loss and plasma creatine kinase (CK) changes following a downhill run. Ten male subjects with a mean (+/- S.D.) age of 22.5 +/- 2.8 years, body mass of 62.67 +/- 0.05 kg and height of 176 +/- 3 cm were allocated to either a treatment group or a control group. The treatment group performed 100 maximal eccentric activations of the knee extensors in the dominant leg at 0.52 rad s-1. Two weeks later, the downhill run was performed on a motor-driven treadmill. This consisted of five bouts of 8 min at a gradient of -10% at a speed corresponding to 80% of the predicted maximal heart rate. The untrained group performed the downhill run as above but without the prior isokinetic session. Tenderness measurements, plasma CK activity and concentric and eccentric isokinetic peak torque measurements of the knee extensors at 0.52 and 2.83 rad s-1 were recorded prior to, immediately following and 2, 4 and 7 days after each protocol. The isokinetic protocol caused an increase (P < 0.01) in CK and tenderness and a decrease (P < 0.05) in concentric and eccentric torque at both speeds in the treatment group. Following the downhill run, a reduction in peak torque (P < 0.01) was observed in the eccentric and concentric modes at both isokinetic speeds in the control group. For the treatment group, the decrease in peak torque occurred only at the faster eccentric speed. With the exception of the faster eccentric speed, the decrement in peak torque was greater in the control group in all post-exercise isokinetic strength tests. There was less tenderness (P < 0.01) in the trained knee extensor muscle group. Peak torque also returned to pre-downhill values earlier for the trained group. Although plasma CK activity increased in both groups after downhill running, it was much lower (P < 0.01) in the trained group. The results suggest that a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric training reduces muscle damage, reduces the amount of strength loss and decreases the sensation of DOMS after downhill running.",
      "# Title: Exercise-induced skeletal muscle damage and adaptation following repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions.\n# Abstract: Repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions were used to examine indirect indices of exercise-induced muscle damage and adaptation in human skeletal muscle. Twenty-four subjects (18 females, 6 males) aged 20.0 +/- 1.4 years (mean +/- S.D.) performed an initial bout of either 10 (n = 7), 30 (n = 9) or 50 (n = 8) maximum voluntary eccentric contractions of the knee extensors, followed by a second bout of 50 contractions 3 weeks later using the same leg. Muscle soreness was elevated after all bouts (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon test), although the initial bout reduced the soreness associated with the second bout. Force loss and a decline in the 20:100 Hz percutaneous electrical myostimulation force ratio were observed after all exercise bouts (P < 0.01). Serum creatine kinase activity was elevated following the initial bouts of 30 and 50 repetitions (P < 0.01), but there was no increase following 10 repetitions. No increase in serum creatine kinase activity was observed in any group following the second bout of contractions (P > 0.05). We conclude that skeletal muscle adaptation can be brought about by a single bout of relatively few eccentric muscle contractions. Increasing the number of eccentric muscle repetitions did not result in an increased prophylactic effect on skeletal muscle.",
      "# Title: Influence of previous concentric exercise on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether a fatiguing concentric exercise performed immediately before eccentric exercise would exacerbate eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. One arm of nine female subjects (mean +/- s: 23.3 +/- 6.7 years) performed 12 maximal eccentric actions of the elbow flexors (ECC), and the other arm performed 100 repetitions of isokinetic concentric actions of the elbow flexors followed by the same eccentric exercise (CON-ECC). The two exercise regimens (ECC and CON-ECC) were separated by 2 weeks and presented in a counterbalanced order. Changes in muscle soreness level, maximal isometric force generation, relaxed and flexed elbow joint angle, upper arm circumference and plasma creatine kinase activity were compared between the ECC and CON-ECC conditions. All measures changed significantly after both ECC and CON-ECC; however, there were significant differences in the changes between the conditions. A lower level of soreness, a faster recovery of maximal isometric force generation, a smaller decrease in relaxed elbow joint angle and a smaller increase in upper arm circumference and creatine kinase activity were evident after the CON-ECC condition compared to the ECC condition. Thus, it would seem that muscle damage was attenuated by performance of previous concentric exercise. An additional experiment using a different group of subjects (n = 5) showed that warm-up exercise before the eccentric exercise also attenuated eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Acute adaptation to low volume eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: Many symptoms of eccentric muscle damage can be substantially reduced if a similar eccentric bout is repeated within several weeks of the initial bout. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a nondamaging, low repetition, low volume eccentric exercise bout could also provide a protective/adaptive effect.",
      "# Title: The repeated bout effect of reduced-load eccentric exercise on elbow flexor muscle damage.\n# Abstract: In this study we investigated the extent to which an initial eccentric exercise consisting of two (2ECC) or six maximal eccentric actions (6ECC) of the elbow flexors would produce a similar effect to 24 maximal eccentric actions (24ECC), on a second bout of 24ECC performed 2 weeks later. Male students (n = 34) were assigned to one of three groups, and with their non-dominant arm performed either 2ECC (n = 12), 6ECC (n = 10), or 24ECC (n = 12) as a first bout of exercise. Two weeks later all groups performed 24ECC. Maximal isometric strength, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration were assessed before, immediately after, and for 4 days after exercise. Changes in all variables were compared between the bouts and groups by a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance. All variables changed significantly (P< 0.05) after 2ECC, 6ECC, and 24ECC, but the amount of change after 2ECC and 6ECC was significantly smaller (P<0.05) than both 6ECC and 24ECC, and 24ECC, respectively. After the second bout, the 6ECC and 24ECC groups showed a profound repeated bout effect, and no significant differences were found between the groups. All variables except muscle soreness were significantly (P< 0.05) larger after the second bout for the 2ECC group, however the changes observed after 24ECC were significantly smaller (P < 0.01) than those observed after the first 24ECC of the 24ECC group. These results suggest that it is not necessary to conduct a high number of eccentric actions in the first bout to elicit a repeated bout effect in a subsequent bout performed some time later.",

      "# Title: Intensity of eccentric exercise, shift of optimum angle, and the magnitude of repeated-bout effect.\n# Abstract: This study compared the effect of four different intensities of initial eccentric exercise (ECC1) on optimum angle shift and extent of muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise. Fifty-two male students were placed into 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% groups (n = 13 per group), performing 30 eccentric actions of the elbow flexors of 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% of maximal isometric strength [maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)] for ECC1, followed 2-3 wk later by a similar exercise (ECC2) that used 100% MVC load. MVC at six elbow joint angles, range of motion, upper arm circumference, serum creatine kinase activity, myoglobin concentration, and muscle soreness were measured before and for 5 days following ECC1 and ECC2. A rightward shift of optimum angle following ECC1 was significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 100% and 80% than for the 60% and 40% groups, and it decreased significantly (P < 0.05) from immediately to 5 days postexercise. By the time ECC2 was performed, only the 100% group kept a significant shift (4 degrees). Changes in most of the criterion measures following ECC1 were significantly greater for the 100% and 80% groups compared with the 60% and 40% groups. Changes in the criterion measures following ECC2 were significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 40% group compared with other groups. Although the magnitude of repeated bout effect following ECC2 was significantly (P < 0.05) smaller for the 40% and 60% groups, all groups showed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced changes in criterion measures following ECC2 compared with the ECC1 100% bout. We conclude that the repeated-bout effect was not dependent on the shift of optimum angle.",
      "# Title: Repeated bout effect after maximal eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: We hypothesized that a bout of high or low volume eccentric exercise would protect against muscle damage following a subsequent high volume bout and that adaptation would be attributable to neural changes, independent of the initial exercise volume. Sixteen males performed either 45 (ECC45) or 10 (ECC10) maximal eccentric contractions using the elbow flexors, followed by an ECC45 bout 2 weeks later. Damage markers were measured for the following 96 h; EMG and work done during the first 10 eccentric contractions were also recorded. CK, soreness, and decrements in MVC and range of motion (ROM) were greater in bout 1 than bout 2 (p < 0.01). Soreness, MVC and ROM were greater after the initial ECC45 bout compared to the initial ECC10 bout and the repeated bouts of ECC45 exercise in both groups (p < 0.01). Median frequency decreased from bout 1 to bout 2 (p < 0.001), no differences between groups were observed. An ECC45 bout of maximal eccentric exercise causes more initial damage than an ECC10 bout of maximal eccentric exercise, although both confer protection from subsequent ECC45 bouts of maximal eccentric contractions, which are attributable, at least in part, to a shift in the frequency content of EMG.",
      "# Title: A light load eccentric exercise confers protection against a subsequent bout of more demanding eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that a light eccentric exercise (ECC) that does not induce a loss of muscle function and delayed onset muscle soreness would confer a protective effect against a more strenuous ECC. Eighteen young men were randomly placed into two groups: 10-40% (n=9) and 40% (n=9). Subjects in the 10-40% group performed ECC of the elbow flexors (six sets of five reps) using a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (MVC) at an elbow joint angle of 90 degrees , followed 2 days later by ECC using a dumbbell weight of 40% MVC. Subjects in the 40% group performed the 40% ECC only. Changes in MVC, range of motion (ROM), upper arm circumference (CIR), plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and muscle soreness before, immediately after, 1-5 and 7 days following the 40% ECC were compared between groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any of the criterion measures were found immediately and 1-2 days after the 10% ECC. Following the 40% ECC, the 10-40% group showed significantly (P<0.05) smaller decreases in MVC and ROM, and smaller increases in muscle soreness compared with the 40% group, but no significant differences between groups were evident for CIR and plasma CK activity. These results suggest that the 10% ECC induced some protection against a subsequent bout of 40% ECC performed 2 days later. It appears that the light eccentric exercise preconditioned the muscles for exposure to the subsequent damaging eccentric exercise bout.",
      "# Title: Protection against muscle damage following fifty drop jumps conferred by ten drop jumps.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether 10 drop jumps (DJs) would confer protective effect against muscle damage and soreness in a subsequent bout of 50 DJs. Sixteen men were randomly placed into either a group performing 1 set of 10 DJs followed by 5 sets of 10 DJs (10-50, n = 8) or another group performing 2 bouts of 5 sets of 10 DJs (50-50, n = 8) separated by 2 weeks. The DJs were performed from a box height of 0.6 m, with a 10-second interval between jumps and a 1-minute rest between sets. Jump height, peak vertical ground reaction force, ground contact time, and heart rate during DJs were measured, and blood lactate concentration was assessed before and immediately after DJs. Changes in maximal isometric (ISO) and isokinetic concentric torque (CON), vertical jump, muscle soreness, and plasma creatine kinase activity before, immediately after, and at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours following exercise were compared between groups for the first and second bouts and between the bouts by a 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance. Changes in ISO, CON, vertical jump, and muscle soreness were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller for 10 DJs compared with 50 DJs; however, no significant differences in the measures between groups were evident following the second bout. The changes in the measures following 50 DJs in the 10-50 group were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller than those following the first bout of the 50-50 group. These results suggest that 10 DJs and 50 DJs conferred the same magnitude of protective effect against muscle damage by 50 DJs.",
      "# Title: Muscle damage protection by low-intensity eccentric contractions remains for 2 weeks but not 3 weeks.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that the protective effect conferred by a low-intensity eccentric exercise against maximal eccentric exercise would not last more than a week. Untrained men (21.3 ± 1.6 years) were allocated into either a control or one of four repeated bout groups (n = 13 per group). The repeated bout groups performed 30 low-intensity eccentric contractions (ECC) of the elbow flexors with a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (10%-ECC) either 2 days, 7 days (1 week), 14 days (2 weeks) or 21 days (3 weeks) before 30 maximal eccentric contractions (Max-ECC). The control group performed Max-ECC only. Changes in maximal voluntary contraction strength, optimum angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following 10%-ECC were analysed by a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Changes in the variables following Max-ECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. The 10%-ECC did not change any variables, showing no indication of muscle damage. The changes in all variables following Max-ECC were smaller (P < 0.05) for 2-day, 1- and 2-week groups than control group, without significant differences between 2-day and 1-week groups. The 2-week group showed greater (P < 0.05) changes in all variables compared with 2-day and 1-week groups. Changes in the variables were similar between 3-week and control groups, except for muscle soreness showing smaller (P < 0.05) changes for 3-week group. These results suggest that non-damaging eccentric exercise confers a protective effect against Max-Ecc, but the effect is attenuated between 1 and 2 weeks.",
      "# Title: Two maximal isometric contractions attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVC-ISO) would attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. Young untrained men were placed into one of the two experimental groups or one control group (n = 13 per group). Subjects in the experimental groups performed either two or 10 MVC-ISO of the elbow flexors at a long muscle length (20° flexion) 2 days prior to 30 maximal isokinetic eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors. Subjects in the control group performed the eccentric contractions without MVC-ISO. No significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction peak torque, peak torque angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and myoglobin concentration, muscle soreness, and ultrasound echo intensity were evident after MVC-ISO. Changes in the variables following eccentric contractions were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2 MVC-ISO group (e.g., peak torque loss at 5 days after exercise, 23% ± 3%; peak CK activity, 1964 ± 452 IU·L(-1); peak muscle soreness, 46 ± 4 mm) or the 10 MVC-ISO group (13% ± 3%, 877 ± 198 IU·L(-1), 30 ± 4 mm) compared with the control (34% ± 4%, 6192 ± 1747 IU·L(-1), 66 ± 5 mm). The 10 MVC-ISO group showed smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following eccentric contractions compared with the 2 MVC-ISO group. Therefore, two MVC-ISO conferred potent protective effects against muscle damage, whereas greater protective effect was induced by 10 MVC-ISO, which can be used as a strategy to minimize muscle damage.",

      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions attenuate muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise of the knee extensors in the elderly.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors would attenuate the magnitude of muscle damage induced by maximal eccentric exercise of the same muscle performed 7 days later using elderly individuals. Healthy older men (66.4 ± 4.6 years) were assigned to control or experimental (Exp) group (n = 13 per group). The control group performed six sets of ten maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC) of the knee extensors of non-dominant leg. The Exp group performed six sets of ten low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors on a leg extension machine by lowering a weight of 10 % maximal voluntary isometric knee extension strength (10 %ECC) 7 days prior to MaxECC. Changes in maximal voluntary isokinetic concentric torque (MVC-CON), angle at peak torque, range of motion (ROM), upper thigh circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin (Mb) concentration and B-mode ultrasound echo-intensity before and for 5 days after MaxECC were compared between groups by a mixed factor ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were observed following 10 %ECC. Following MaxECC, all variables changed significantly, and changes in all variables except for angle at peak torque were significantly different between groups. MVC-CON and ROM decreased smaller and recovered faster (P < 0.05) for Exp than control group, and changes in other variables were smaller (P < 0.05) for Exp group compared with control group. These results suggest that preconditioning knee extensor muscles with low-intensity eccentric contractions was effective for attenuating muscle damage induced by subsequent MaxECC of the knee extensors for elderly individuals.",
      "# Title: Effect of two maximal isometric contractions on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the elbow flexors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the time wise protective effect conferred by two maximal voluntary isometric contractions (2MVCs) at 20° elbow flexion on muscle damage induced by 30 maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors (MaxECC). Sixty-five young untrained men were randomly assigned to a control group that did not perform 2MVCs, or one of four experimental groups (n = 13 per group) who performed 2MVCs either immediately (0d), 2 (2d), 4 (4d) or 7 days (7d) before MaxECC. Changes in maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) concentric torque (MVC-CON), optimum angle (OA), range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following MaxECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were evident following 2MVCs. The 2d and 4d groups showed 16-62 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following MaxECC than the control, 0d and 7d groups. The 2d group showed 14-34 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables except for OA compared with the 4d group. The changes in the variables were similar among the control, 0d and 7d groups. These results show that 2MVCs that were performed between 2 and 4 days before MaxECC attenuated the magnitude of muscle damage, but no such effect was evident if the 2MVCs were performed immediately or 7 days before MaxECC. It is concluded that the protective effect conferred by 2MVCs is relatively short-lived, and there is a window for the effect to be conferred.",
      "# Title: Effect of a prior bout of preconditioning exercise on muscle damage from downhill walking.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether reduced-duration downhill walking (DW) would confer a protective effect against muscle damage induced by a subsequent bout of longer duration DW performed 1 week or 4 weeks later. Healthy young adults were allocated to a control or one of the preconditioning exercise (PRE-1wk or PRE-4wk) groups (10 men and 4 women per group). PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups performed 20-min DW (-28% slope, 5 km/h, 10% body mass added to a backpack) 1 week and 4 weeks before 40-min DW, respectively, and the control group performed 40-min DW only. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) knee extension torque, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity, and muscle soreness (100-mm visual analog scale) were measured before, immediately after, and 24, 48, and 72 h after DW, and the changes in these variables were compared among groups. The control group showed symptoms of muscle damage (e.g., prolonged decrease in MVC: -14% ± 10% at 48 h post-DW) after 40-min DW. Changes in all variables after 40-min DW of PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups were 54%-61% smaller (P < 0.05) than the control group, without significant differences between PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups for MVC and plasma CK activity. Importantly, changes after the preconditioning exercise (20-min DW) were 67%-69% smaller (P < 0.05) than those after the 40-min DW of the control group. These findings suggest that 20-min DW resulting in minor muscle damage conferred a protective effect against subsequent 40-min DW, and its effect could last for more than 4 weeks.",

      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors and flexors protect against muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the magnitude and duration of the protective effect of low-intensity eccentric contractions (LowEC) against damage induced by maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) of the knee flexors (KF) and extensors (KE). Young men were assigned to 8 experimental groups and 2 control groups (n = 13/group); the experimental groups performed LowEC of KF or KE 2 days (2d), 1 week (1wk), 2 weeks (2wk), or 3 weeks (3wk) before MaxEC, while the control groups performed MaxEC of KF or KE without LowEC. The 2d, 1wk, 2wk, and 3wk groups performed 30 LowEC of KF or 60 LowEC of KE with a load of 10% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction strength on a resistance-training machine, and all groups performed 30 MaxEC of KF or 60 MaxEC of KE on an isokinetic dynamometer. Several muscle damage markers were measured from before to 2 days after exercise (LowEC) or from before to 5 days after exercise (MaxEC). No significant changes in any variables were evident after LowEC. The changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2d and 1wk groups (e.g., peak creatine kinase activity: 1002 ± 501 IU/L; peak muscle soreness: 13 ± 5 mm) than for the control group (peak creatine kinase activity: 3005 ± 983 IU/L; peak muscle soreness 28 ± 6 mm) for both KE and KF. There were no significant differences between the 2d and 1wk groups or among the 2wk, 3wk, and control groups. These results show that LowEC provided 30%-66% protection against damage induced by MaxEC of KF and KE, and the protective effect lasted 1 week.",
      "# Title: Protective effect by maximal isometric contractions against maximal eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the knee extensors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) performed before maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) would attenuate muscle damage of the knee extensors. Untrained men were placed to an experimental group that performed 6 sets of 10 MVIC at 90° knee flexion 2 weeks before 6 sets of 10 MaxEC or a control group that performed MaxEC only (n = 13/group). Changes in muscle damage markers were assessed before to 5 days after each exercise. Small but significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction torque, range of motion (ROM) and plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity were evident at immediately to 2 days post-MVIC (p < 0.05), but other variables (e.g. thigh girth, myoglobin concentration, B-mode echo intensity) did not change significantly. Changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (p < 0.05) by 45% (soreness)-67% (CK) for the experimental than the control group. These results suggest that MVIC conferred potent protective effect against MaxEC-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Prevention of downhill walking-induced muscle damage by non-damaging downhill walking.\n# Abstract: Mountain trekking involves level, uphill, and downhill walking (DW). Prolonged DW induces damage to leg muscles, reducing force generating ability and muscle coordination. These increase risks for more serious injuries and accidents in mountain trekking, thus a strategy to minimize muscle damage is warranted. It has been shown that low-intensity eccentric contractions confer protective effect on muscle damage induced by high-intensity eccentric contractions. This study tested the hypothesis that 5-min non-damaging DW would attenuate muscle damage induced by 40-min DW, but 5-min level walking (LW) would not.",
      "# Title: Isometric pre-conditioning blunts exercise-induced muscle damage but does not attenuate changes in running economy following downhill running.\n# Abstract: Running economy (RE) is impaired following unaccustomed eccentric-biased exercises that induce muscle damage. It is also known that muscle damage is reduced when maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) are performed at a long muscle length 2-4 days prior to maximal eccentric exercise with the same muscle, a phenomenon that can be described as isometric pre-conditioning (IPC). We tested the hypothesis that IPC could attenuate muscle damage and changes in RE following downhill running. Thirty untrained men were randomly assigned into experimental or control groups and ran downhill on a treadmill (-15%) for 30 min. Participants in the experimental group completed 10 MVIC in a leg press machine two days prior to downhill running, while participants in the control group did not perform IPC. The magnitude of changes in muscle soreness determined 48 h after downhill running was greater for the control group (122 ± 28 mm) than for the experimental group (92 ± 38 mm). Isometric peak torque recovered faster in the experimental group compared with the control group (3 days vs. no full recovery, respectively). No significant effect of IPC was found for countermovement jump height, serum creatine kinase activity or any parameters associated with RE. These results supported the hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in markers of muscle damage. The hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in RE was not supported by our data. It appears that the mechanisms involved in changes in markers of muscle damage and parameters associated with RE following downhill running are not completely shared.",

      "# Title: Protective Effect Conferred by Isometric Preconditioning Against Slow- and Fast-Velocity Eccentric Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage.\n# Abstract: We investigated if the same isometric preconditioning protocol (IPP) attenuates the magnitude of muscle damage induced by different maximal eccentric exercise protocols in the elbow flexors. Sixty-four untrained men were assigned to either two experimental or two control groups. Participants in the experimental groups performed an IPP prior to either slow (60°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-S) or fast (180°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-F) maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC). Subjects in the control groups performed slow (ECC-S) or fast (ECC-F) MaxECC without IPP. Maximal isokinetic concentric torque (MVC), muscle soreness (SOR), and muscle thickness (MT) were assessed before, immediately after, and 1-4 days following the MaxECC. Significant (p < 0.05) group vs. time interactions were found for MVC (F = 4,517), SOR (F = 6,318), and MT (F = 1,863). The ECC-S group presented faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and MT and less (p < 0.05) SOR at 96 h post-MaxECC compared with ECC-F group. No significant differences in MVC and MT were found between ECC-S and ECC-F groups following MaxECC. The ISO + ECC-S group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and SOR compared to the ECC-S group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ECC-S in any variable. The ISO + ECC-F group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of all assessed variables compared with the ECC-F group. MVC was greater (p < 0.05) at 48-72 h, and SOR was less (p < 0.05) at 48-96 h in the ISO + ECC-F compared to the ECC-F group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ISO + ECC-F for any variable. These results show that the IPP accelerated recovery of MVC and SOR for the slow-eccentric exercise condition and attenuated strength loss and SOR in addition to faster recovery of all assessed variables for the fast-eccentric exercise condition. Therefore, the IPP can be used as a strategy to attenuate and accelerate recovery of muscle damage induced by different-velocity eccentric exercises, resulting in greater protection against muscle damage induced by faster velocity."

A total of 80 patients with acute cerebral infarction who were treated at our hospital were randomly selected. They were divided into groups A and B. The two groups were treated with intravenous thrombolysis, while group B received sub-hypothermia treatment. Prior to treatment and at 7 days after treatment, 5 ml of venous blood was collected and stored in a freezer at -80˚C. IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 levels were detected by ELISA and compared between the groups and time-points. The results were as follows: i) At 7 days after treatment, the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in group B were significantly decreased compared with those in group A (P<0.05), while there was no significant difference of these levels between group A and B before treatment (P>0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions in group A and group B was 35 and 20% respectively, and the mortality rate was 10 and 5%, respectively. There were no significant differences in adverse events and mortality between the two groups (P>0.05). In addition, a positive correlation of the level of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was determined in the patients prior to treatment. In conclusion, mild hypothermia treatment in addition to intravenous thrombolysis significantly reduced the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in patients with acute cerebral infarction and reduced inflammation, and should therefore be incorporated in clinical practice.",

Our objective was to determine if mFI predicts morbidity and mortality in the diverse national cohort of patients undergoing neurosurgery for intracranial neoplasms. We identified patients in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program who underwent oncologic neurosurgery procedures between 2008 and 2012. The mFI, ranging from 0 to 1, was calculated as the proportion of 11 possible risk factors present. We assessed the associations between mFI and 30-day mortality, neurologic and medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge in univariate and multivariable analyses and compare the index to established risk stratification techniques. A total of 9149 patients were identified. Mortality, severe medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge increased incrementally with increasing levels of frailty. Severe neurologic complications were highest in those with low frailty. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, increased frailty increased the odds of all adverse outcomes, including neurologic complications. The mFI increased the ability to predict all outcomes beyond available indices and was the most reliable predictor of neurologic complications. The mFI can be calculated from routinely collected medical record data and is predictive of 30-day adverse outcomes in a wide variety of neurosurgical oncology patients. The index may be a useful component of preoperative risk assessment with implications for shared decision-making, perioperative planning, and risk adjusted outcomes measurement in national quality registries.",

      "# Title: Frailty and outcomes after craniotomy for brain tumor.\n# Abstract: Frailty has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in a variety of surgical disciplines. Few data exist regarding the relationship of frailty with adverse outcomes in craniotomy for brain tumor resection. We assessed the relationship between frailty and the incidence of major post-operative complication, discharge destination other than home, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality after elective craniotomy for brain tumor resection. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 20,333 adult patients undergoing elective craniotomy for tumor resection in the 2012-2018 ACS-NSQIP Participant Use File. Multivariate logistic regression was performed using all covariates deemed eligible through clinical and statistical significance. 6,249 patients (30.7%) were low-frailty and 2,148 patients (10.6%) were medium-to-high frailty. In multivariate logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, BMI, ASA classification, smoking status, dyspnea, significant pre-operative weight loss, chronic steroid use, bleeding disorder, tumor type, and operative time, low frailty was associated with increased adjusted odds ratio of major complication (1.41, 95% CI: 1.23-1.60, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.32, 95% CI: 1.20-1.46, p < 0.001), 30-day readmission (1.29, 95% CI: 1.15-1.44, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (1.87, 95% CI: 1.41-2.47, p < 0.001). Moderate-to-high frailty was also associated with increased adjusted odds of major complication (1.61, 95% CI: 1.35-1.92, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.80, 95% CI: 1.58-2.05), 30-day readmission (1.39, 95% CI: 1.19-1.62, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (2.42, 95% CI: 1.74-3.38, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is associated with increased odds of major post-operative complication, discharge to destination other than home, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality.",

    "referenceConclusion": "The primary goal of this review was to scope evidence regarding neurocognitive and neurophysiological functions that could be related to ACL injury in athletes and to synthesize them into RTS and rehabilitation paradigms. The existing evidence shows that cognitive skills and CNS functions may be linked to an increased injury risk and diminish postinjury performance in athletes. Cortical reorganization may demand compensatory strategies and occupy cognitive reserve, which makes it difficult to manage dynamic environment in sports. RTS and rehabilitation concepts should consider this notion to prevent second injuries and to achieve an adequate competitive level in athletes.",

Alterations in the central nervous system also play a role, but their influence after injury, recovery, and recurrent injury remain unknown. Modern neuroimaging techniques can be used to elucidate the underlying functional and structural alterations of the brain that predicate the neuromuscular control adaptations associated with ACL injury. This knowledge will further our understanding of the neural adaptations after ACL injury and rehabilitation and in relation to injury risk. In this paper, we describe the measurement of brain activation during knee extension-flexion after ACL injury and reconstruction and 26 days before a contralateral ACL injury.",
      "# Title: Corticospinal and intracortical excitability differ between athletes early after ACLR and matched controls.\n# Abstract: Neuromuscular impairments, such as quadriceps weakness and activation deficits, persist after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Recent research demonstrating changes in the function of the primary motor cortex after ACLR posits that quadriceps impairments may be influenced by reduced corticospinal excitability. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the integrity of the neuromotor axis of the vastus medialis is altered in subjects 2 weeks post-ACLR compared to uninjured control subjects. Eighteen athletes 2 weeks post-ACLR and 18 age and sex matched uninjured control subjects participated in this cross-sectional study. We quantified corticospinal (resting motor threshold, RMT; motor evoked potential amplitudes at 120% RMT, MEP120 ) and intracortical (inhibition and facilitation) excitability using single and paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), respectively. We assessed spinal-reflex excitability (H-reflex amplitude normalized to maximal M-wave, H/M ratio) using peripheral stimulation. Subjects post-ACLR had higher RMTs (p = 0.001), greater MEP120 amplitudes (p = 0.001), and more asymmetric facilitation (p = 0.041) than the uninjured control subjects. No significant group differences were found for intracortical inhibition (p = 0.289) and H/M ratio (p = 0.332). Our findings indicate that both intracortical and corticospinal excitability of vastus medialis are bilaterally altered in subjects 2 weeks after ACLR. Given persistent neuromuscular deficits seen after ACLR, rehabilitation strategies targeting intracortical and corticospinal deficits may potentially improve clinical outcomes. © 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

      "# Title: Quadriceps muscle function following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: systemic differences in neural and morphological characteristics.\n# Abstract: Quadriceps muscle dysfunction is common following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Data considering the diversity of neural changes, in-concert with morphological adaptations of the quadriceps muscle, are lacking. We investigated bilateral differences in neural and morphological characteristics of the quadriceps muscle in ACLR participants (n = 11, month post-surgery: 69.4 ± 22.4) compared to controls matched by sex, age, height, weight, limb dominance, and activity level. Spinal reflex excitability was assessed using Hoffmann reflexes (H:M); corticospinal excitability was quantified via active motor thresholds (AMT) and motor-evoked potentials (MEP) using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Cortical activation was assessed using a knee flexion/extension task with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Muscle volume was quantified using structural MRI. Muscle strength and patient-reported outcomes were also collected. 2 × 2 RM ANOVAs were used to evaluate group differences. Smaller quadriceps muscle volume (total volume, rectus femoris, vastus medialis, and intermedius) and lower strength were detected compared to contralateral and control limbs. Individuals with ACLR reported higher levels of pain and fear and lower levels of knee function compared to controls. No differences were observed for H:M. ACLR individuals demonstrated higher AMT bilaterally and smaller MEPs in the injured limb, compared to the controls. ACLR participants demonstrated greater activation in frontal lobe areas responsible for motor and pain processing compared to controls, which were associated with self-reported pain. Our results suggest that individuals with ACLR demonstrate systemic neural differences compared to controls, which are observed concurrently with smaller quadriceps muscle volume, quadriceps muscle weakness, and self-reported dysfunction.",

      "# Title: Corticomotor function is associated with quadriceps rate of torque development in individuals with ACL surgery.\n# Abstract: Impaired corticomotor function arising from altered intracortical and corticospinal pathways are theorized to impede muscle recovery following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) surgery, yet functional implications of centrally driven adaptations remain unclear. We aimed to assess relationships between quadriceps corticomotor and neuromechanical function after ACL surgery, and to compare with contralateral and control limbs. 16 individuals after primary, unilateral ACL surgery and 16 sex- and age-matched controls participated. Corticomotor function was assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation, and quantified via active motor thresholds (AMT), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF). Neuromechanical function was quantified via electromechanical delay, early and late-phase rate of torque development (RTD0-50, RTD100-200), coefficient of variation, maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) torque, and central activation ratio. We observed significant correlations in the ACL limbs between: AMT and RTD0-50 (r = - 0.513, p = 0.031), SICI and RTD100-200 (r = 0.501, p = 0.048), AMT and SICI (r = - 0.659, p = 0.010), AMT and ICF (r = 0.579, p = 0.031), RTD0-50 and MVIC (r = 0.504, p = 0.023), and RTD100-200 and MVIC (r = 0.680, p = 0.002). The ACL limbs demonstrated higher AMT compared to controls (44.9 ± 8.4 vs. 30.1 ± 8.2%, p < 0.001), and lesser MVIC torque (2.37 ± 0.52 vs. 2.80 ± 0.59 Nm/kg, p = 0.005) and RTD100-200 (6.79 ± 1.72 vs. 7.90 ± 1.98 Nm/kg/s, p = 0.006) compared to the contralateral limbs. Our findings indicate that lesser corticospinal excitability is associated with lesser early-phase RTD, and greater intracortical inhibition is associated with lesser late-phase RTD. These findings provide evidence of implications of altered intracortical and corticospinal pathways relative to the ability to rapidly generate quadriceps torque following ACL surgery.",

      "# Title: Athletes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction demonstrate asymmetric intracortical facilitation early after surgery.\n# Abstract: Quadriceps dysfunction persists after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), yet the etiology remains elusive. Inhibitory and facilitatory intracortical networks (ie, intracortical excitability) may be involved in quadriceps dysfunction, yet the investigation of these networks early after ACLR is sparse. The purposes of this study were to examine (a) changes in intracortical excitability in athletes after ACLR compared to uninjured athletes during the course of postoperative rehabilitation, (b) the association between intracortical excitability and quadriceps strength in athletes after ACLR. Eighteen level I/II athletes after ACLR between the ages of 18 to 30 years and eighteen healthy sex, age, and activity matched athletes were tested at three-time points: (a) 2 weeks after surgery, (b) achievement of a \"quiet knee\" defined as full range of motion and minimal effusion, (c) return to running time point defined as achievement of a quadriceps index ≥80% and at least 12 weeks post-ACLR. Short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF), measured via transcranial magnetic stimulation and isometric quadriceps strength were examined bilaterally at each time point. There was a significant group × limb interaction (P = .017) for ICF. The ACLR group demonstrated asymmetric ICF (greater in the nonsurgical limb) compared to controls and a significant relationship between SICI and quadriceps strength of the surgical limb at the quiet knee time point (P = .018). ACLR individuals demonstrate differential effects on ICF between limbs. Also, SICI is associated with isometric quadriceps strength after ACLR, suggesting increased inhibition of the motor cortex may contribute to impaired quadriceps strength following ACLR.",

      "# Title: Neural activity for hip-knee control in those with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A task-based functional connectivity analysis.\n# Abstract: Anterior cruciate ligament injury may induce neurophysiological changes for sensorimotor control. Neuroimaging investigations have revealed unique brain activity patterns for knee movement following injury, indicating potential neural mechanisms underlying aberrant neuromuscular control that may contribute to heightened risk of secondary injury, altered movement patterns and poor patient outcomes. However, neuroimaging paradigms thus far have been limited to single joint, single motion knee tasks. Therefore, we sought to overcome prior limitations to understand the effects of injury on neural control of lower extremity movement by employing a multi-joint motor paradigm and determining differences in neural activity between ACL-reconstructed (ACLr) individuals relative to healthy matched controls. Fifteen patients with left anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and fifteen matched healthy controls participated in this study. Neural activity was examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging during a block-designed knee-hip movement paradigm (similar to a supine heel-slide). Participants for each group were monitored and task performance was controlled via a metronome to ensure the same spatial-temporal parameters. We observed that those with ACL reconstruction displayed increased activation within the intracalcarine cortex, lingual gyrus, occipital fusiform gyrus, lateral occipital cortex, angular gyrus, and superior parietal lobule relative to controls. A follow-up task-based functional connectivity analyses using seed regions identified from the group analysis revealed connectivity among fronto-insular-temporal and sensorimotor regions within the ACLr participants. The results of this fMRI investigation suggest ACLr individuals require increased activity and connectivity in areas responsible for visual-spatial cognition and orientation, and attention for hip and knee motor control."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the determinants and consequences of surveillance completeness. Patients who underwent endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair between October 1996 and August 2004 and enrolled in the EUROSTAR registry were analyzed. Two groups were compared: patients who attended all scheduled visits (group A) and those who came infrequently (group B). Odds ratios and hazard rates (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined to detect which patient characteristics and complications were associated with follow-up intensity. Of the 4,433 patients, 1,538 (35%) attended all scheduled visits until the end of follow-up (group A). Analysis of patient characteristics demonstrated that intensive visitors were more often smokers, hyperlipemic, and considered unfit for open surgery or general anesthesia. Complications during follow-up, including endoleaks (24% vs. 20%), kinking (3.5% vs. 2.5%), and migration (4.9% vs. 3.5%), appeared significantly more frequently in group A. Despite intensive follow-up of this category, still a greater proportion died (12% vs. 9%, adjusted HR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.8). After 84 months of follow-up, the cumulative survival rates in groups A and B were 71% and 74%, respectively (p < 0.0001). It seems that follow-up intensity was based on baseline patient characteristics. High-risk patients had, despite more intensive surveillance, still more complications after adjustment for patient, morphological, and center-specific characteristics.

However, BI-ALCL diagnosis on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) might be challenging for pathologists lacking experience with peri-implant breast effusions. Sixty-seven late breast implant seromas collected by FNA from 50 patients were evaluated by Papanicolaou smear stain and immunocytochemistry on cell blocks. A diagnostic algorithm based on the cellular composition, cell morphology and percentage of CD30+ cells was developed. Histological evaluation of the corresponding peri-prosthetic capsules was also performed. Most of the effusions (91% of the samples) were classified as reactive and 9% as BI-ALCL. In the BI-ALCL cases, medium-to-large atypical cells expressing CD30 represented more than 70% of the cellularity, whereas in in the reactive effusions CD30+ elements were extremely rare (<5%) and consisted of non-atypical elements. The reactive effusions were categorized into three patterns: i) acute infiltrate with prominent neutrophilic component (33% of the samples); ii) mixed infiltrate characterized by a variable number of neutrophils, lymphocytes and macrophages (30% of the samples); iii) chronic infiltrate composed predominantly of T lymphocytes or macrophages with only sporadic granulocytes (37% of the samples). The inflammatory cytological patterns were consistent with the histology of the corresponding capsules. Our results indicate that cytological analysis of late breast implant effusions, supported by the knowledge of the heterogeneous cytomorphological spectrum of late seromas, is a valuable approach for the early recognition of BI-ALCL.",

Its etiology unknown, one hypothesis suggests an initiating inflammatory stimulus, possibly infectious, triggers BIA-ALCL. We analyzed microbiota of breast, skin, implant and capsule in BIA-ALCL patients (n = 7), and controls via culturing methods, 16S rRNA microbiome sequencing, and immunohistochemistry. Alpha and beta diversity metrics and relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria were calculated, and phylogenetic trees constructed. Staphylococcus spp., the most commonly cultured microbes, were identified in both the BIA-ALCL and contralateral control breast. The diversity of bacterial microbiota did not differ significantly between BIA-ALCL and controls for any material analyzed. Further, there were no significant differences in the relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria between BIA-ALCL and control specimens. Heat maps suggested substantial diversity in the composition of the bacterial microbiota of the skin, breast, implant and capsule between patients with no clear trend to distinguish BIA-ALCL from controls. While we identified no consistent differences between patients with BIA-ALCL-affected and contralateral control breasts, this study provides insights into the composition of the breast microbiota in this population.",

      "# Title: Gram-Negative Bacterial Lipopolysaccharide Promotes Tumor Cell Proliferation in Breast Implant-Associated Anaplastic Large-Cell Lymphoma.\n# Abstract: Breast implant-associated anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) is a distinct malignancy associated with textured breast implants. We investigated whether bacteria could trigger the activation and multiplication of BIA-ALCL cells in vitro. BIA-ALCL patient-derived BIA-ALCL tumor cells, BIA-ALCL cell lines, cutaneous ALCL cell lines, an immortal T-cell line (MT-4), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from BIA-ALCL, capsular contracture, and primary augmentation patients were studied. Cells were subjected to various mitogenic stimulation assays including plant phytohemagglutinin (PHA), Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Staphylococcal superantigens enterotoxin A (SEA), toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), or sterilized implant shells. Patient-derived BIA-ALCL tumor cells and BIA-ALCL cell lines showed a unique response to LPS stimulation. This response was dampened significantly in the presence of a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) inhibitor peptide. In contrast, cutaneous ALCL cells, MT-4, and PBMC cells from all patients responded significantly more to PHA, SEA, and TSST-1 than to LPS. Breast implant shells of all surface grades alone did not produce a proliferative response of BIA-ALCL cells, indicating the breast implant does not act as a pro-inflammatory stimulant. These findings indicate a possible novel pathway for LPS to promote BIA-ALCL cell proliferation via a TLR4 receptor-mediated bacterial transformation of T-cells into malignancy."

      "# Title: Serum Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2-binding protein for patients with chronic hepatitis B and C: a comparative study.\n# Abstract: We compared Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2-binding protein (WFA+ -M2BP) levels between patients with chronic hepatitis B (n=249) and chronic hepatitis C (n=386) based on the degree of liver fibrosis. We examined WFA+ -M2BP levels in patients with F4 (cirrhosis), F3 or more (advanced fibrosis) and F2 or more (significant fibrosis) in the two groups. We further examined the relationship between five fibrosis markers and the degree of fibrosis. The WFA+ -M2BP values ranged from 0.25 cut-off index (COI) to 12.9 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 0.34-20.0 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P<.0001). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F4 in the two groups were 2.83 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 5.03 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P=.0046). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F3 or more in the two groups were 1.79 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 3.79 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P<.0001). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F2 or more in the two groups were 1.49 COI in the hepatitis B cohort and 3.19 COI in the hepatitis C group (P<.0001). Among five liver fibrosis markers, WFA+ -M2BP had the highest correlation coefficient (rs =.629) in terms of correlation with the degree of fibrosis in the patients with hepatitis C and had the second highest rs value (.415) in the hepatitis B group. Although WFA+ -M2BP could be a useful indicator of liver fibrosis, WFA+ -M2BP levels in the two groups significantly differed even in the same degree of fibrosis. Individual cut-off values in each aetiology for the degree of fibrosis should be determined.",
      "# Title: Serum Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n# Abstract: Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein (WFA+-M2BP) has been suggested to be useful for the assessment of disease severity in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Consecutive adult NAFLD patients who had a liver biopsy were included. Serum WFA+-M2BP level was measured using a lectin-antibody sandwich immunoassay using a chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay machine (HISCL-5000, Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). The measured levels were indexed using the following equation: Cut-off index (COI) = ([WFA+-M2BP]sample-[WFA+-M2BP]NC) / ([WFA+-M2BP]PC-[WFA+-M2BP]NC), where PC = positive control and NC = negative control. Histopathological examination of liver biopsy specimen was reported according to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Clinical Research Network Scoring System. Data for 220 cases were analyzed. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of NASH was 0.65. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of steatosis grade ≥2 and 3 was 0.64 and 0.53, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of lobular inflammation grade ≥1, ≥2 and 3 was 0.57, 0.68 and 0.59, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of hepatocyte ballooning grade ≥1 and 2 was 0.64 and 0.65, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of fibrosis stage ≥1, ≥2, ≥3 and 4 was 0.61, 0.71, 0.74 and 0.84, respectively. Out of the 220 cases, 152 cases were the same 76 patients who had a repeat liver biopsy after 48 weeks of intervention. The AUROC of the change in the COI to detect improvement in steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning and fibrosis was 0.57, 0.54, 0.59 and 0.52, respectively. In conclusion, serum WFA+-M2BP was most useful for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in NAFLD patients. However, it was less useful for differentiating NASH from non-NASH, and for diagnosis and follow-up of the individual histopathological components of NASH.",
      "# Title: Serum Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2-binding protein expression predicts disease severity in chronic hepatitis C patients.\n# Abstract: Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein (WFA+-M2BP) has recently been developed as a promising liver fibrosis glyco biomarker. We assessed its efficacy in evaluating liver disease severity in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in Taiwan. The association between WFA+-M2BP and histological features was evaluated among those CHC patients underwent liver biopsy. We also aimed to clarify the factors determining the performance of WFA+-M2BP in CHC. A total of 229 CHC patients were consecutively recruited. The mean value of WFA+-M2BP in patients from F0 to F4 was 1.68, 2.23, 3.45, 3.48, 3.77 respectively (linear trend P = 0.008). Linear regression analysis revealed that alanine aminotransferase (odds ratio [OR]: 0.03, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.02-0.05, P < 0.001), AST (OR: -0.1, 95% CI: -0.02 to -0.01, P < 0.001), and liver fibrosis (OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.01-0.59, P = 0.043) were the independent factors correlated to serum WFA+-M2BP level. The optimal cutoff values of WFA+-M2BP for fibrosis stages F1, F2, F3, and F4 were 1.42, 1.61, 1.42, and 2.67, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the platelet count (OR/CI: -0.009/0.986-0.996, P = <0.001), r-glutamyl transferase (OR/CI: 0.007/1.000-1.013, P = 0.036), and WFA+-M2BP (OR/CI: 0.187/1.057-1.374, P = 0.005). We concluded that WFA+-M2BP is a competent noninvasive marker for liver fibrosis assessment in CHC patients.",

      "# Title: Comparison of serum fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B.\n# Abstract: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The diagnosis of liver fibrosis has a key role in selecting patients with CHB for antiviral treatment. However, serum biomarkers demonstrate limited diagnostic utility. The present study aimed to compare the performances of fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB and to identify the most appropriate biomarker for these patients. The current study included 96 antiviral-naïve patients with CHB who underwent liver biopsy. METAVIR scoring system was used to assess liver fibrosis and necroinflammation. The diagnostic performances were evaluated of the platelet (PLT) count; the levels of hyaluronan, serum 7S domain of type 4 collagen, procollagen type III N-terminal peptide, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1, Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) and N-terminal type III collagen propeptide (Pro-C3); the fibrosis index based on four factors; the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index; and enhanced liver fibrosis score for identifying significant liver fibrosis [≥fibrosis stage 2 (F2)]. All fibrosis biomarkers, except the Pro-C3 level, correlated with the fibrosis stage. M2BPGi was better than other biomarkers for diagnosing ≥F2, with the highest area under the curve of 0.902. M2BPGi demonstrated a higher diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis than mild/severe fibrosis or cirrhosis. However, no significant correlation was observed between the M2BPGi level and fibrosis stage in patients with CHB having significant liver necroinflammation defined as ≥ necroinflammatory activity 2. The M2BPGi level and PLT count were exclusively correlated with the fibrosis stage in 73 patients without significant liver necroinflammation. M2BPGi demonstrated the highest diagnostic performance for significant fibrosis in patients having significant liver fibrosis with no significant liver necroinflammation. In conclusion, the M2BPGi level can accurately diagnose significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB.",

This study evaluated the performance of WFA+ -M2BP in predicting fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. A total of 80 patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) were enrolled. Serum WFA+ -M2BP levels were measured using standard methods. The fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index was also measured. The mean values of WFA+ -M2BP were 1.0, 1.0, 0.8, and 2.2 in Metavir fibrosis stage F0, F1, F2, and F3-4, respectively (linear trend p = 0.005). The optimal cut-off value of WFA+ -M2BP in predicting advanced fibrosis (F3-4) was 1.37 cut-off index (COI), yielding the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, and accuracy of 75.0, 79.4, 39.1, 94.7, and 78.7%, respectively (p < 0.001). Combining WFA+ -M2BP with FIB-4 significantly increased the diagnostic performance for advanced fibrosis, yielding specificity, PPV, and accuracy of 100, 100, and 93%, respectively. The significant factors predicting advanced liver fibrosis in the multivariate regression analysis were WFA+ -M2BP ≥ 1.37 COI (OR/confidence interval [CI]: 9.49/1.63-55.21, p = 0.01) and FIB-4 ≥ 2.80 (OR/CI: 38.18/4.89-297.93, p = 0.001).

      "# Title: Therapeutic effects of a reducible poly (oligo-D-arginine) carrier with the heme oxygenase-1 gene in the treatment of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.\n# Abstract: Non-viral carriers for gene therapy have been developed to minimize carrier cytotoxicity and to enhance transfection efficiency. Previously, we synthesized a 9-arginine-based reducible high molecular weight peptide for gene delivery. For the reducible poly(oligo-D-arginines) (rPOA), 9-arginine oligopeptides are connected by internal disulfide linkages to produce a high molecular weight peptide. In this study, rPOA was evaluated as a carrier of the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene for the treatment of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) -induced brain stroke. An in vitro transfection assay showed that rPOA had higher transfection efficiency and lower toxicity than polyethylenimine (PEI). For in vivo evaluation, I/R rat models were produced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). rPOA/HO-1 expression plasmid (pHO-1) polyplexes were injected into the brain at 1 h before MCAO, and HO-1 expression levels in the brain were then measured by ELISA. The results indicated that rPOA/pHO-1 polyplexes had higher transfection efficiencies than PEI/pHO-1 polyplexes. The rPOA/pHO-1 polyplexes significantly reduced infarct volumes. In addition, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) was reduced in the rPOA/pHO-1 polyplex injection group, suggesting that HO-1 had an anti-inflammatory effect, while the PEI/pHO-1 polyplex did not show this effect. These results suggest that rPOA is a potential non-viral vector for HO-1 gene therapy to protect brain cells from I/R-related neuronal injury including stroke.",
      "# Title: Poly-arginine and arginine-rich peptides are neuroprotective in stroke models.\n# Abstract: Using cortical neuronal cultures and glutamic acid excitotoxicity and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) stroke models, we demonstrated that poly-arginine and arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), are highly neuroprotective, with efficacy increasing with increasing arginine content, have the capacity to reduce glutamic acid-induced neuronal calcium influx and require heparan sulfate preotoglycan-mediated endocytosis to induce a neuroprotective effect. Furthermore, neuroprotection could be induced with immediate peptide treatment or treatment up to 2 to 4 hours before glutamic acid excitotoxicity or OGD, and with poly-arginine-9 (R9) when administered intravenously after stroke onset in a rat model. In contrast, the JNKI-1 peptide when fused to the (non-arginine) kFGF CPP, which does not rely on endocytosis for uptake, was not neuroprotective in the glutamic acid model; the kFGF peptide was also ineffective. Similarly, positively charged poly-lysine-10 (K10) and R9 fused to the negatively charged poly-glutamic acid-9 (E9) peptide (R9/E9) displayed minimal neuroprotection after excitotoxicity. These results indicate that peptide positive charge and arginine residues are critical for neuroprotection, and have led us to hypothesize that peptide-induced endocytic internalization of ion channels is a potential mechanism of action. The findings also question the mode of action of different neuroprotective peptides fused to arginine-rich CPPs.",

      "# Title: The R18 Polyarginine Peptide Is More Effective Than the TAT-NR2B9c (NA-1) Peptide When Administered 60 Minutes after Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in the Rat.\n# Abstract: We examined the dose responsiveness of polyarginine R18 (100, 300, and 1000 nmol/kg) when administered 60 minutes after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The TAT-NR2B9c peptide, which is known to be neuroprotective in rodent and nonhuman primate stroke models, served as a positive control. At 24 hours after MCAO, there was reduced total infarct volume in R18 treated animals at all doses, but this reduction only reached statistical significance at doses of 100 and 1000 nmol/kg. The TAT-NR2B9c peptide reduced infarct volume at doses of 300 and 1000 nmol/kg, but not to a statistically significant extent, while the 100 nmol/kg dose was ineffective. The reduction in infarct volume with R18 and TAT-NR2B9c peptide treatments was mirrored by improvements in one or more functional outcomes (namely, neurological score, adhesive tape removal, and rota-rod), but not to a statistically significant extent. These findings further confirm the neuroprotective properties of polyarginine peptides and for R18 extend its therapeutic time window and dose range, as well as demonstrating its greater efficacy compared to TAT-NR2B9c in a severe stroke model. The superior neuroprotective efficacy of R18 over TAT-NR2B9c highlights the potential of this polyarginine peptide as a lead candidate for studies in human stroke.",
      "# Title: Assessment of the Neuroprotective Effects of Arginine-Rich Protamine Peptides, Poly-Arginine Peptides (R12-Cyclic, R22) and Arginine-Tryptophan-Containing Peptides Following In Vitro Excitotoxicity and/or Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in Rats.\n# Abstract: We have demonstrated that arginine-rich and poly-arginine peptides possess potent neuroprotective properties with arginine content and peptide positive charge being particularly critical for neuroprotective efficacy. In addition, the presence of other amino acids within arginine-rich peptides, as well as chemical modifications, peptide length and cell-penetrating properties also influence the level of neuroprotection. Against this background, we have examined the neuroprotective efficacy of arginine-rich protamine peptides, a cyclic (R12-c) poly-arginine peptide and a R22 poly-arginine peptide, as well as arginine peptides containing tryptophan or other amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, glycine or leucine) in in vitro glutamic acid excitotoxicity and in vivo rat permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion models of stroke. In vitro studies demonstrated that protamine and poly-arginine peptides (R12-c, R22) were neuroprotective. Arginine-tryptophan-containing peptides were highly neuroprotective, with R12W8a being the most potent arginine-rich peptide identified in our laboratory. Peptides containing phenylalanine or tyrosine substituted in place of tryptophan in R12W8a were also highly neuroprotective, whereas leucine, and in particular glycine substitutions, decreased peptide efficacy. In vivo studies with protamine administered intravenously at 1000 nmol/kg 30 min after MCAO significantly reduced infarct volume and cerebral oedema by 22.5 and 38.6%, respectively. The R12W8a peptide was highly toxic when administered intravenously at 300 or 100 nmol/kg and ineffective at reducing infarct volume when administered at 30 nmol/kg 30 min after MCAO, unlike R18 (30 nmol/kg), which significantly reduced infarct volume by 20.4%. However, both R12W8a and R18 significantly reduced cerebral oedema by 19.8 and 42.2%, respectively. Protamine, R12W8a and R18 also reduced neuronal glutamic acid-induced calcium influx. These findings further highlight the neuroprotective properties of arginine-rich peptides and support the view that they represent a new class of neuroprotective agent.",
      "# Title: Delayed 2-h post-stroke administration of R18 and NA-1 (TAT-NR2B9c) peptides after permanent and/or transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat.\n# Abstract: Following positive results with the poly-arginine peptide R18 when administered intravenously 30 or 60min after permanent and/or transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO; 90min) in the rat, we examined the effectiveness of the peptide when administered 2h after MCAO. R18 was administered intravenously (1000nmol/kg via jugular vein) after permanent MCAO or a transient 3-h MCAO or when administered intra-arterially (100nmol/kg via internal carotid artery) immediately after reperfusion following a transient 2-h MCAO. In the transient MCAO studies, the neuroprotective NA-1 peptide was used as a positive control. Infarct volume, cerebral edema and functional outcomes were measured 24h after MCAO. Following permanent or transient MCAO, neither R18 nor NA-1 significantly reduced infarct volume. However, following permanent MCAO, R18 appeared to reduce cerebral edema (p=0.006), whereas following a transient 3-h MCAO, R18 improved the time to remove adhesive tape (p=0.04) without significantly affecting cerebral edema. There was also a trend (p=0.07) towards improved rota-rod performance with R18 in both permanent and transient 3-h MCAO. Following a transient 2-h MCAO, R18 had no significant effects on cerebral edema or neurological score but did lessen the extent of weight loss. Overall, while R18 had no effect on infarct volume, the peptide reduced cerebral edema after permanent MCAO, and improved some functional outcomes after transient MCAO.",
      "# Title: Warburg effect hypothesis in autism Spectrum disorders.\n# Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disease which is characterized by a deficit in social interactions and communication with repetitive and restrictive behavior. In altered cells, metabolic enzymes are modified by the dysregulation of the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway. In ASD, the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway is upregulated. We focus this review on the hypothesis of Warburg effect stimulated by the overexpression of the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway in ASD. Upregulation of WNT/β-catenin pathway induces aerobic glycolysis, named Warburg effect, through activation of glucose transporter (Glut), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1(PDK1), monocarboxylate lactate transporter 1 (MCT-1), lactate dehydrogenase kinase-A (LDH-A) and inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH). The aerobic glycolysis consists to a supply of a large part of glucose into lactate regardless of oxygen. Aerobic glycolysis is less efficient in terms of ATP production than oxidative phosphorylation because of the shunt of the TCA cycle. Dysregulation of energetic metabolism might promote cell deregulation and progression of ASD. Warburg effect regulation could be an attractive target for developing therapeutic interventions in ASD.",
      "# Title: Comparison of neuroprotective efficacy of poly-arginine R18 and R18D (D-enantiomer) peptides following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in the Wistar rat and in vitro toxicity studies.\n# Abstract: We have previously demonstrated that arginine-rich and poly-arginine peptides possess potent neuroprotective properties, with poly-arginine peptide R18 identified as being highly effective at reducing infarct volume following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the Sprague Dawley rat. Since peptides synthesised using D-isoform amino acids have greater stability than L-isoform peptides due to increased resistance to proteolytic degradation, they represent potentially more effective peptide therapeutics. Therefore we compared the neuroprotective efficacy of R18 and its D-enantiomer R18D following permanent MCAO in the Wistar rat. Furthermore, as increased peptide stability may also increase peptide toxicity, we examined the effects of R18 and R18D on cultured cortical neurons, astrocytes, brain endothelial cells (bEND.3), and embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) following a 10-minute or 24-hour peptide exposure duration. The in vivo studies demonstrated that R18D resulted in a greater reduction in mean infarct volume compared to R18 (33%, p = 0.004 vs 12%, p = 0.27) after intravenous administration at 300 nmol/kg 30 minutes after MCAO. Both R18D and R18 reduced cerebral hemisphere swelling to a comparable degree (27%, p = 0.03 and 30%, p = 0.02), and improved neurological assessment scores (1.5, p = 0.02 and 2, p = 0.058 vs 3 for vehicle). No abnormal histological findings specific to peptide treatments were observed in hematoxylin and eosin stained sections of kidney, liver, spleen, lung and heart. In vitro studies demonstrated that R18 and R18D were most toxic to neurons, followed by astrocytes, HEK293 and bEND.3 cells, but only at high concentrations and/or following 24-hour exposure. These findings further highlight the neuroprotective properties of poly-arginine peptides, and indicate that R18D at the dose examined is more potent than R18 in Wistar rats, and justify continued investigation of the R18 peptide as a novel neuroprotective agent for stroke.",

In the development of a therapeutic for HIE, we examined the neuroprotective efficacy of the poly-arginine peptide R18D (arginine 18 mer synthesised with D-arginine) in a perinatal model of hypoxia-ischaemia (HI; common carotid and external carotid occlusion + 8%O2 /92%N2 for 2.5 hr) in the P7 Sprague-Dawley rat. R18D was administered intraperitoneally 30 min (doses 10, 30, 100, 300 and 1,000 nmol/kg), 60 min (doses 30 and 300 nmol/kg) or 120 min (doses 30 and 300 nmol/kg) after HI. Infarct volumes and behavioural outcomes were measured 48 hr after HI. When administered 30 min after HI, R18D at varying doses reduced infarct volume by 23.7% to 35.6% (p = 0.009 to < 0.0001) and resulted in improvements in the negative geotactic response and wire-hang times, at a dose of 30 nmol/kg. When administered 60 min after HI, R18D at the 30 nmol/kg dose reduced total infarct volume by 34.2% (p = 0.002), whilst the 300 nmol/kg dose improved wire-hang time. When administered 120 min after HI, R18D at the 30 and 300 nmol/kg doses had no significant impact on infarct volume, but the 300 nmol/kg dose improved the negative geotactic response. This study further confirms the neuroprotective properties of poly-arginine peptides, demonstrating that R18D can reduce infarct volume and improve behavioural outcomes after HI if administered up to 60 min after HI and improve behavioural outcomes up to 2 hr after HI.",
      "# Title: Poly-Arginine Peptides R18 and R18D Improve Functional Outcomes After Endothelin-1-Induced Stroke in the Sprague Dawley Rat.\n# Abstract: We have previously demonstrated that R18 and its d-enantiomer, R18D, are neuroprotective at 24 hours following intraluminal filament occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) in the rat. This study examined R18 and R18D effectiveness in improving functional outcomes at up to 56 days poststroke following endothelin-1-induced MCAO. Peptides were administered intravenously at doses of 100, 300, or 1000 nmol/kg, 60 minutes after MCAO. Functional recovery poststroke was assessed using multiple forelimb placing tests and horizontal ladder test, and NA-1 (TAT-NR2B9c), a neuroprotective currently in phase 3 clinical stroke trials, was used as a benchmark. The study demonstrated that R18 (300 and 1000 nmol/kg) was the most effective peptide in improving functional outcomes, followed by R18D (300 and 1000 nmol/kg), and NA-1 (300 and 100 nmol/kg). Furthermore, R18 at doses of 300 and 1000 nmol/kg was the most effective agent in restoring pre-stroke body weight, while R18 and R18D at doses of 300 and 1000 nmol/kg, but not NA-1 also significantly reduced the number of animals requiring hand feeding 48 hours after stroke. This study confirms that R18 and R18D are effective in improving long-term functional outcomes after stroke, and suggests that R18 may be more effective than NA-1.",
      "# Title: Comparative Assessment of the Proteolytic Stability and Impact of Poly-Arginine Peptides R18 and R18D on Infarct Growth and Penumbral Tissue Preservation Following Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in the Sprague Dawley Rat.\n# Abstract: Poly-arginine peptides R18 and R18D have previously been demonstrated to be neuroprotective in ischaemic stroke models. Here we examined the proteolytic stability and efficacy of R18 and R18D in reducing infarct core growth and preserving the ischaemic penumbra following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the Sprague Dawley rat. R18 (300 or 1000 nmol/kg), R18D (300 nmol/kg) or saline were administered intravenously 10 min after MCAO induced using a filament. Serial perfusion and diffusion-weighted MRI imaging was performed to measure changes in the infarct core and penumbra from time points between 45- and 225-min post-occlusion. Repeated measures analyses of infarct growth and penumbral tissue size were evaluated using generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs). R18D (300 nmol/kg) was most effective in slowing infarct core growth (46.8 mm3 reduction; p < 0.001) and preserving penumbral tissue (21.6% increase; p < 0.001), followed by R18 at the 300 nmol/kg dose (core: 29.5 mm3 reduction; p < 0.001, penumbra: 12.5% increase; p < 0.001). R18 at the 1000 nmol/kg dose had a significant impact in slowing core growth (19.5 mm3 reduction; p = 0.026), but only a modest impact on penumbral preservation (6.9% increase; p = 0.062). The in vitro anti-excitotoxic neuroprotective efficacy of R18D was also demonstrated to be unaffected when preincubated for 1-3 h or overnight, in a cell lysate prepared from dying neurons or with the proteolytic enzyme, plasmin, whereas the neuroprotective efficacy of R18 was significantly reduced after a 2-h incubation. These findings highlight the capacity of poly-arginine peptides to reduce infarct growth and preserve the ischaemic penumbra, and confirm the superior efficacy and proteolytic stability of R18D, which indicates that this peptide is likely to retain its neuroprotective properties when co-administered with alteplase during thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke."

    "referenceConclusion": "Pre-conditioning significantly reduced the severity of creatine kinase release, delayed-onset muscle soreness, loss of maximal voluntary contraction force and the range of motion decrease. Pre-conditioning may prevent severe EIMD and accelerate recovery of muscle force generation capacity. The current systematic review identified that pre-conditioning activities are effective in attenuating EIMD measures, CK, muscle soreness, ROM and maximal voluntary force production. These findings suggest the use of pre-conditioning activities prior to a strenuous bout of exercise does provide a significant protective effect when performed a minimum of 24 h prior to the damaging stimulus. Furthermore, the greater improvement in MVC suggests that the pre-conditioning activities may accelerate the recovery of muscle contractile properties following strenuous exercises. However, it is unclear if pre-conditioning would prevent EIMD from more complex exercises or to what extent EIMD prevention carries over into other modes of exercise.",

      "# Title: Muscle tenderness and peak torque changes after downhill running following a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: Unaccustomed exercise (usually of an eccentric nature) is often followed by delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Previous studies have found that prior eccentric activity produces a training effect which reduces DOMS and morphological changes. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a prior bout of maximal isokinetic eccentric exercise on DOMS, strength loss and plasma creatine kinase (CK) changes following a downhill run. Ten male subjects with a mean (+/- S.D.) age of 22.5 +/- 2.8 years, body mass of 62.67 +/- 0.05 kg and height of 176 +/- 3 cm were allocated to either a treatment group or a control group. The treatment group performed 100 maximal eccentric activations of the knee extensors in the dominant leg at 0.52 rad s-1. Two weeks later, the downhill run was performed on a motor-driven treadmill. This consisted of five bouts of 8 min at a gradient of -10% at a speed corresponding to 80% of the predicted maximal heart rate. The untrained group performed the downhill run as above but without the prior isokinetic session. Tenderness measurements, plasma CK activity and concentric and eccentric isokinetic peak torque measurements of the knee extensors at 0.52 and 2.83 rad s-1 were recorded prior to, immediately following and 2, 4 and 7 days after each protocol. The isokinetic protocol caused an increase (P < 0.01) in CK and tenderness and a decrease (P < 0.05) in concentric and eccentric torque at both speeds in the treatment group. Following the downhill run, a reduction in peak torque (P < 0.01) was observed in the eccentric and concentric modes at both isokinetic speeds in the control group. For the treatment group, the decrease in peak torque occurred only at the faster eccentric speed. With the exception of the faster eccentric speed, the decrement in peak torque was greater in the control group in all post-exercise isokinetic strength tests. There was less tenderness (P < 0.01) in the trained knee extensor muscle group. Peak torque also returned to pre-downhill values earlier for the trained group. Although plasma CK activity increased in both groups after downhill running, it was much lower (P < 0.01) in the trained group. The results suggest that a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric training reduces muscle damage, reduces the amount of strength loss and decreases the sensation of DOMS after downhill running.",
      "# Title: Exercise-induced skeletal muscle damage and adaptation following repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions.\n# Abstract: Repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions were used to examine indirect indices of exercise-induced muscle damage and adaptation in human skeletal muscle. Twenty-four subjects (18 females, 6 males) aged 20.0 +/- 1.4 years (mean +/- S.D.) performed an initial bout of either 10 (n = 7), 30 (n = 9) or 50 (n = 8) maximum voluntary eccentric contractions of the knee extensors, followed by a second bout of 50 contractions 3 weeks later using the same leg. Muscle soreness was elevated after all bouts (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon test), although the initial bout reduced the soreness associated with the second bout. Force loss and a decline in the 20:100 Hz percutaneous electrical myostimulation force ratio were observed after all exercise bouts (P < 0.01). Serum creatine kinase activity was elevated following the initial bouts of 30 and 50 repetitions (P < 0.01), but there was no increase following 10 repetitions. No increase in serum creatine kinase activity was observed in any group following the second bout of contractions (P > 0.05). We conclude that skeletal muscle adaptation can be brought about by a single bout of relatively few eccentric muscle contractions. Increasing the number of eccentric muscle repetitions did not result in an increased prophylactic effect on skeletal muscle.",
      "# Title: Influence of previous concentric exercise on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether a fatiguing concentric exercise performed immediately before eccentric exercise would exacerbate eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. One arm of nine female subjects (mean +/- s: 23.3 +/- 6.7 years) performed 12 maximal eccentric actions of the elbow flexors (ECC), and the other arm performed 100 repetitions of isokinetic concentric actions of the elbow flexors followed by the same eccentric exercise (CON-ECC). The two exercise regimens (ECC and CON-ECC) were separated by 2 weeks and presented in a counterbalanced order. Changes in muscle soreness level, maximal isometric force generation, relaxed and flexed elbow joint angle, upper arm circumference and plasma creatine kinase activity were compared between the ECC and CON-ECC conditions. All measures changed significantly after both ECC and CON-ECC; however, there were significant differences in the changes between the conditions. A lower level of soreness, a faster recovery of maximal isometric force generation, a smaller decrease in relaxed elbow joint angle and a smaller increase in upper arm circumference and creatine kinase activity were evident after the CON-ECC condition compared to the ECC condition. Thus, it would seem that muscle damage was attenuated by performance of previous concentric exercise. An additional experiment using a different group of subjects (n = 5) showed that warm-up exercise before the eccentric exercise also attenuated eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Acute adaptation to low volume eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: Many symptoms of eccentric muscle damage can be substantially reduced if a similar eccentric bout is repeated within several weeks of the initial bout. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a nondamaging, low repetition, low volume eccentric exercise bout could also provide a protective/adaptive effect.",
      "# Title: The repeated bout effect of reduced-load eccentric exercise on elbow flexor muscle damage.\n# Abstract: In this study we investigated the extent to which an initial eccentric exercise consisting of two (2ECC) or six maximal eccentric actions (6ECC) of the elbow flexors would produce a similar effect to 24 maximal eccentric actions (24ECC), on a second bout of 24ECC performed 2 weeks later. Male students (n = 34) were assigned to one of three groups, and with their non-dominant arm performed either 2ECC (n = 12), 6ECC (n = 10), or 24ECC (n = 12) as a first bout of exercise. Two weeks later all groups performed 24ECC. Maximal isometric strength, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration were assessed before, immediately after, and for 4 days after exercise. Changes in all variables were compared between the bouts and groups by a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance. All variables changed significantly (P< 0.05) after 2ECC, 6ECC, and 24ECC, but the amount of change after 2ECC and 6ECC was significantly smaller (P<0.05) than both 6ECC and 24ECC, and 24ECC, respectively. After the second bout, the 6ECC and 24ECC groups showed a profound repeated bout effect, and no significant differences were found between the groups. All variables except muscle soreness were significantly (P< 0.05) larger after the second bout for the 2ECC group, however the changes observed after 24ECC were significantly smaller (P < 0.01) than those observed after the first 24ECC of the 24ECC group. These results suggest that it is not necessary to conduct a high number of eccentric actions in the first bout to elicit a repeated bout effect in a subsequent bout performed some time later.",

      "# Title: Intensity of eccentric exercise, shift of optimum angle, and the magnitude of repeated-bout effect.\n# Abstract: This study compared the effect of four different intensities of initial eccentric exercise (ECC1) on optimum angle shift and extent of muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise. Fifty-two male students were placed into 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% groups (n = 13 per group), performing 30 eccentric actions of the elbow flexors of 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% of maximal isometric strength [maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)] for ECC1, followed 2-3 wk later by a similar exercise (ECC2) that used 100% MVC load. MVC at six elbow joint angles, range of motion, upper arm circumference, serum creatine kinase activity, myoglobin concentration, and muscle soreness were measured before and for 5 days following ECC1 and ECC2. A rightward shift of optimum angle following ECC1 was significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 100% and 80% than for the 60% and 40% groups, and it decreased significantly (P < 0.05) from immediately to 5 days postexercise. By the time ECC2 was performed, only the 100% group kept a significant shift (4 degrees). Changes in most of the criterion measures following ECC1 were significantly greater for the 100% and 80% groups compared with the 60% and 40% groups. Changes in the criterion measures following ECC2 were significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 40% group compared with other groups. Although the magnitude of repeated bout effect following ECC2 was significantly (P < 0.05) smaller for the 40% and 60% groups, all groups showed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced changes in criterion measures following ECC2 compared with the ECC1 100% bout. We conclude that the repeated-bout effect was not dependent on the shift of optimum angle.",
      "# Title: Repeated bout effect after maximal eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: We hypothesized that a bout of high or low volume eccentric exercise would protect against muscle damage following a subsequent high volume bout and that adaptation would be attributable to neural changes, independent of the initial exercise volume. Sixteen males performed either 45 (ECC45) or 10 (ECC10) maximal eccentric contractions using the elbow flexors, followed by an ECC45 bout 2 weeks later. Damage markers were measured for the following 96 h; EMG and work done during the first 10 eccentric contractions were also recorded. CK, soreness, and decrements in MVC and range of motion (ROM) were greater in bout 1 than bout 2 (p < 0.01). Soreness, MVC and ROM were greater after the initial ECC45 bout compared to the initial ECC10 bout and the repeated bouts of ECC45 exercise in both groups (p < 0.01). Median frequency decreased from bout 1 to bout 2 (p < 0.001), no differences between groups were observed. An ECC45 bout of maximal eccentric exercise causes more initial damage than an ECC10 bout of maximal eccentric exercise, although both confer protection from subsequent ECC45 bouts of maximal eccentric contractions, which are attributable, at least in part, to a shift in the frequency content of EMG.",
      "# Title: A light load eccentric exercise confers protection against a subsequent bout of more demanding eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that a light eccentric exercise (ECC) that does not induce a loss of muscle function and delayed onset muscle soreness would confer a protective effect against a more strenuous ECC. Eighteen young men were randomly placed into two groups: 10-40% (n=9) and 40% (n=9). Subjects in the 10-40% group performed ECC of the elbow flexors (six sets of five reps) using a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (MVC) at an elbow joint angle of 90 degrees , followed 2 days later by ECC using a dumbbell weight of 40% MVC. Subjects in the 40% group performed the 40% ECC only. Changes in MVC, range of motion (ROM), upper arm circumference (CIR), plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and muscle soreness before, immediately after, 1-5 and 7 days following the 40% ECC were compared between groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any of the criterion measures were found immediately and 1-2 days after the 10% ECC. Following the 40% ECC, the 10-40% group showed significantly (P<0.05) smaller decreases in MVC and ROM, and smaller increases in muscle soreness compared with the 40% group, but no significant differences between groups were evident for CIR and plasma CK activity. These results suggest that the 10% ECC induced some protection against a subsequent bout of 40% ECC performed 2 days later. It appears that the light eccentric exercise preconditioned the muscles for exposure to the subsequent damaging eccentric exercise bout.",
      "# Title: Protection against muscle damage following fifty drop jumps conferred by ten drop jumps.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether 10 drop jumps (DJs) would confer protective effect against muscle damage and soreness in a subsequent bout of 50 DJs. Sixteen men were randomly placed into either a group performing 1 set of 10 DJs followed by 5 sets of 10 DJs (10-50, n = 8) or another group performing 2 bouts of 5 sets of 10 DJs (50-50, n = 8) separated by 2 weeks. The DJs were performed from a box height of 0.6 m, with a 10-second interval between jumps and a 1-minute rest between sets. Jump height, peak vertical ground reaction force, ground contact time, and heart rate during DJs were measured, and blood lactate concentration was assessed before and immediately after DJs. Changes in maximal isometric (ISO) and isokinetic concentric torque (CON), vertical jump, muscle soreness, and plasma creatine kinase activity before, immediately after, and at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours following exercise were compared between groups for the first and second bouts and between the bouts by a 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance. Changes in ISO, CON, vertical jump, and muscle soreness were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller for 10 DJs compared with 50 DJs; however, no significant differences in the measures between groups were evident following the second bout. The changes in the measures following 50 DJs in the 10-50 group were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller than those following the first bout of the 50-50 group. These results suggest that 10 DJs and 50 DJs conferred the same magnitude of protective effect against muscle damage by 50 DJs.",
      "# Title: Muscle damage protection by low-intensity eccentric contractions remains for 2 weeks but not 3 weeks.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that the protective effect conferred by a low-intensity eccentric exercise against maximal eccentric exercise would not last more than a week. Untrained men (21.3 ± 1.6 years) were allocated into either a control or one of four repeated bout groups (n = 13 per group). The repeated bout groups performed 30 low-intensity eccentric contractions (ECC) of the elbow flexors with a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (10%-ECC) either 2 days, 7 days (1 week), 14 days (2 weeks) or 21 days (3 weeks) before 30 maximal eccentric contractions (Max-ECC). The control group performed Max-ECC only. Changes in maximal voluntary contraction strength, optimum angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following 10%-ECC were analysed by a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Changes in the variables following Max-ECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. The 10%-ECC did not change any variables, showing no indication of muscle damage. The changes in all variables following Max-ECC were smaller (P < 0.05) for 2-day, 1- and 2-week groups than control group, without significant differences between 2-day and 1-week groups. The 2-week group showed greater (P < 0.05) changes in all variables compared with 2-day and 1-week groups. Changes in the variables were similar between 3-week and control groups, except for muscle soreness showing smaller (P < 0.05) changes for 3-week group. These results suggest that non-damaging eccentric exercise confers a protective effect against Max-Ecc, but the effect is attenuated between 1 and 2 weeks.",
      "# Title: Two maximal isometric contractions attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVC-ISO) would attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. Young untrained men were placed into one of the two experimental groups or one control group (n = 13 per group). Subjects in the experimental groups performed either two or 10 MVC-ISO of the elbow flexors at a long muscle length (20° flexion) 2 days prior to 30 maximal isokinetic eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors. Subjects in the control group performed the eccentric contractions without MVC-ISO. No significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction peak torque, peak torque angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and myoglobin concentration, muscle soreness, and ultrasound echo intensity were evident after MVC-ISO. Changes in the variables following eccentric contractions were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2 MVC-ISO group (e.g., peak torque loss at 5 days after exercise, 23% ± 3%; peak CK activity, 1964 ± 452 IU·L(-1); peak muscle soreness, 46 ± 4 mm) or the 10 MVC-ISO group (13% ± 3%, 877 ± 198 IU·L(-1), 30 ± 4 mm) compared with the control (34% ± 4%, 6192 ± 1747 IU·L(-1), 66 ± 5 mm). The 10 MVC-ISO group showed smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following eccentric contractions compared with the 2 MVC-ISO group. Therefore, two MVC-ISO conferred potent protective effects against muscle damage, whereas greater protective effect was induced by 10 MVC-ISO, which can be used as a strategy to minimize muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Attenuation of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage by preconditioning exercises.\n# Abstract: This study compared the effect of an initial exercise consisting of either low-intensity eccentric or maximal isometric contractions (ISOs) on protective effect against maximal eccentric contraction (MaxECC)-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions attenuate muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise of the knee extensors in the elderly.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors would attenuate the magnitude of muscle damage induced by maximal eccentric exercise of the same muscle performed 7 days later using elderly individuals. Healthy older men (66.4 ± 4.6 years) were assigned to control or experimental (Exp) group (n = 13 per group). The control group performed six sets of ten maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC) of the knee extensors of non-dominant leg. The Exp group performed six sets of ten low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors on a leg extension machine by lowering a weight of 10 % maximal voluntary isometric knee extension strength (10 %ECC) 7 days prior to MaxECC. Changes in maximal voluntary isokinetic concentric torque (MVC-CON), angle at peak torque, range of motion (ROM), upper thigh circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin (Mb) concentration and B-mode ultrasound echo-intensity before and for 5 days after MaxECC were compared between groups by a mixed factor ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were observed following 10 %ECC. Following MaxECC, all variables changed significantly, and changes in all variables except for angle at peak torque were significantly different between groups. MVC-CON and ROM decreased smaller and recovered faster (P < 0.05) for Exp than control group, and changes in other variables were smaller (P < 0.05) for Exp group compared with control group. These results suggest that preconditioning knee extensor muscles with low-intensity eccentric contractions was effective for attenuating muscle damage induced by subsequent MaxECC of the knee extensors for elderly individuals.",
      "# Title: Effect of two maximal isometric contractions on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the elbow flexors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the time wise protective effect conferred by two maximal voluntary isometric contractions (2MVCs) at 20° elbow flexion on muscle damage induced by 30 maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors (MaxECC). Sixty-five young untrained men were randomly assigned to a control group that did not perform 2MVCs, or one of four experimental groups (n = 13 per group) who performed 2MVCs either immediately (0d), 2 (2d), 4 (4d) or 7 days (7d) before MaxECC. Changes in maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) concentric torque (MVC-CON), optimum angle (OA), range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following MaxECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were evident following 2MVCs. The 2d and 4d groups showed 16-62 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following MaxECC than the control, 0d and 7d groups. The 2d group showed 14-34 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables except for OA compared with the 4d group. The changes in the variables were similar among the control, 0d and 7d groups. These results show that 2MVCs that were performed between 2 and 4 days before MaxECC attenuated the magnitude of muscle damage, but no such effect was evident if the 2MVCs were performed immediately or 7 days before MaxECC. It is concluded that the protective effect conferred by 2MVCs is relatively short-lived, and there is a window for the effect to be conferred.",
      "# Title: Effect of a prior bout of preconditioning exercise on muscle damage from downhill walking.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether reduced-duration downhill walking (DW) would confer a protective effect against muscle damage induced by a subsequent bout of longer duration DW performed 1 week or 4 weeks later. Healthy young adults were allocated to a control or one of the preconditioning exercise (PRE-1wk or PRE-4wk) groups (10 men and 4 women per group). PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups performed 20-min DW (-28% slope, 5 km/h, 10% body mass added to a backpack) 1 week and 4 weeks before 40-min DW, respectively, and the control group performed 40-min DW only. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) knee extension torque, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity, and muscle soreness (100-mm visual analog scale) were measured before, immediately after, and 24, 48, and 72 h after DW, and the changes in these variables were compared among groups. The control group showed symptoms of muscle damage (e.g., prolonged decrease in MVC: -14% ± 10% at 48 h post-DW) after 40-min DW. Changes in all variables after 40-min DW of PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups were 54%-61% smaller (P < 0.05) than the control group, without significant differences between PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups for MVC and plasma CK activity. Importantly, changes after the preconditioning exercise (20-min DW) were 67%-69% smaller (P < 0.05) than those after the 40-min DW of the control group. These findings suggest that 20-min DW resulting in minor muscle damage conferred a protective effect against subsequent 40-min DW, and its effect could last for more than 4 weeks.",

Young men were assigned to 8 experimental groups and 2 control groups (n = 13/group); the experimental groups performed LowEC of KF or KE 2 days (2d), 1 week (1wk), 2 weeks (2wk), or 3 weeks (3wk) before MaxEC, while the control groups performed MaxEC of KF or KE without LowEC. The 2d, 1wk, 2wk, and 3wk groups performed 30 LowEC of KF or 60 LowEC of KE with a load of 10% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction strength on a resistance-training machine, and all groups performed 30 MaxEC of KF or 60 MaxEC of KE on an isokinetic dynamometer. Several muscle damage markers were measured from before to 2 days after exercise (LowEC) or from before to 5 days after exercise (MaxEC). No significant changes in any variables were evident after LowEC. The changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2d and 1wk groups (e.g., peak creatine kinase activity: 1002 ± 501 IU/L; peak muscle soreness: 13 ± 5 mm) than for the control group (peak creatine kinase activity: 3005 ± 983 IU/L; peak muscle soreness 28 ± 6 mm) for both KE and KF. There were no significant differences between the 2d and 1wk groups or among the 2wk, 3wk, and control groups. These results show that LowEC provided 30%-66% protection against damage induced by MaxEC of KF and KE, and the protective effect lasted 1 week.",
      "# Title: Protective effect by maximal isometric contractions against maximal eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the knee extensors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) performed before maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) would attenuate muscle damage of the knee extensors. Untrained men were placed to an experimental group that performed 6 sets of 10 MVIC at 90° knee flexion 2 weeks before 6 sets of 10 MaxEC or a control group that performed MaxEC only (n = 13/group). Changes in muscle damage markers were assessed before to 5 days after each exercise. Small but significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction torque, range of motion (ROM) and plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity were evident at immediately to 2 days post-MVIC (p < 0.05), but other variables (e.g. thigh girth, myoglobin concentration, B-mode echo intensity) did not change significantly. Changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (p < 0.05) by 45% (soreness)-67% (CK) for the experimental than the control group. These results suggest that MVIC conferred potent protective effect against MaxEC-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Prevention of downhill walking-induced muscle damage by non-damaging downhill walking.\n# Abstract: Mountain trekking involves level, uphill, and downhill walking (DW). Prolonged DW induces damage to leg muscles, reducing force generating ability and muscle coordination. These increase risks for more serious injuries and accidents in mountain trekking, thus a strategy to minimize muscle damage is warranted. It has been shown that low-intensity eccentric contractions confer protective effect on muscle damage induced by high-intensity eccentric contractions. This study tested the hypothesis that 5-min non-damaging DW would attenuate muscle damage induced by 40-min DW, but 5-min level walking (LW) would not.",
      "# Title: Isometric pre-conditioning blunts exercise-induced muscle damage but does not attenuate changes in running economy following downhill running.\n# Abstract: Running economy (RE) is impaired following unaccustomed eccentric-biased exercises that induce muscle damage. It is also known that muscle damage is reduced when maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) are performed at a long muscle length 2-4 days prior to maximal eccentric exercise with the same muscle, a phenomenon that can be described as isometric pre-conditioning (IPC). We tested the hypothesis that IPC could attenuate muscle damage and changes in RE following downhill running. Thirty untrained men were randomly assigned into experimental or control groups and ran downhill on a treadmill (-15%) for 30 min. Participants in the experimental group completed 10 MVIC in a leg press machine two days prior to downhill running, while participants in the control group did not perform IPC. The magnitude of changes in muscle soreness determined 48 h after downhill running was greater for the control group (122 ± 28 mm) than for the experimental group (92 ± 38 mm). Isometric peak torque recovered faster in the experimental group compared with the control group (3 days vs. no full recovery, respectively). No significant effect of IPC was found for countermovement jump height, serum creatine kinase activity or any parameters associated with RE. These results supported the hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in markers of muscle damage. The hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in RE was not supported by our data. It appears that the mechanisms involved in changes in markers of muscle damage and parameters associated with RE following downhill running are not completely shared.",

This study investigated whether 10% EC would confer damage protective effect on high-intensity eccentric contractions (80% EC) for nine different muscle groups.",
      "# Title: Protective Effect Conferred by Isometric Preconditioning Against Slow- and Fast-Velocity Eccentric Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage.\n# Abstract: We investigated if the same isometric preconditioning protocol (IPP) attenuates the magnitude of muscle damage induced by different maximal eccentric exercise protocols in the elbow flexors. Sixty-four untrained men were assigned to either two experimental or two control groups. Participants in the experimental groups performed an IPP prior to either slow (60°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-S) or fast (180°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-F) maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC). Subjects in the control groups performed slow (ECC-S) or fast (ECC-F) MaxECC without IPP. Maximal isokinetic concentric torque (MVC), muscle soreness (SOR), and muscle thickness (MT) were assessed before, immediately after, and 1-4 days following the MaxECC. Significant (p < 0.05) group vs. time interactions were found for MVC (F = 4,517), SOR (F = 6,318), and MT (F = 1,863). The ECC-S group presented faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and MT and less (p < 0.05) SOR at 96 h post-MaxECC compared with ECC-F group. No significant differences in MVC and MT were found between ECC-S and ECC-F groups following MaxECC. The ISO + ECC-S group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and SOR compared to the ECC-S group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ECC-S in any variable. The ISO + ECC-F group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of all assessed variables compared with the ECC-F group. MVC was greater (p < 0.05) at 48-72 h, and SOR was less (p < 0.05) at 48-96 h in the ISO + ECC-F compared to the ECC-F group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ISO + ECC-F for any variable. These results show that the IPP accelerated recovery of MVC and SOR for the slow-eccentric exercise condition and attenuated strength loss and SOR in addition to faster recovery of all assessed variables for the fast-eccentric exercise condition. Therefore, the IPP can be used as a strategy to attenuate and accelerate recovery of muscle damage induced by different-velocity eccentric exercises, resulting in greater protection against muscle damage induced by faster velocity."

      "conclusionA": "Performing a prior bout of low-to-moderate volume eccentric or isometric exercise—even as little as two maximal isometric contractions or 10-50 eccentric actions—significantly attenuates subsequent exercise-induced muscle damage, typically within a window of 1-2 weeks, regardless of exercise modality (downhill walking, elbow flexors, knee extensors) or contraction velocity; however, this protective effect is not sustained beyond 2-3 weeks.",
      "conclusionB": "Eccentric exercise, performed at a submaximal intensity, currently stands out as the most effective pre-conditioning strategy for reducing Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage (EIMD); however, the magnitude of this effect is significantly moderated by participant characteristics – notably training status and sex – and the specific muscle group targeted, necessitating individualized and nuanced application of pre-conditioning protocols."

      "# Title: Comparisons of forward and backward gait between poorer and better attention capabilities in early Parkinson's disease.\n# Abstract: This study compared forward and backward gait between Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with poorer and better attention capabilities. PD and healthy control (HC) participants received a dual-stimuli attention task. The results were assessed using principal component analysis to quantify and rank attention capability. Accordingly, 22 PD and 42 HC subjects were equally divided into poorer (14 PD-P, 18 HC-P) and better (8 PD-B, 24 HC-B) attention capabilities. To analyze the spatiotemporal gait parameters, each participant walked forwards and backwards on a GAITRite(®) walkway. Compared to HC, PD performed worse in the dual task and exhibited slower velocity, less swing, and shorter stride in both walking directions. Notably, PD-P experienced all these gait defects, regardless of directions. PD-B walked worse than HC-B backwards, and displayed comparable gait to HC-P in both directions. In PD and HC, velocity, stride, and swing decreased perceptibly when walking backwards compared to forwards, and the same was true for velocity and stride in PD-P and PD-B. Backward strides were reduced evidently more in PD-P than in PD-B. However, backward swing reductions in PD-P and PD-B were statistically insignificant. Cadence in both directions was similar within the groups and between the groups, and there were little alterations between directions within each group and between groups. These results suggest that attention capability may affect PD gait. Poorer attention exacerbates gait defects and better attention improves gait in both directions. These results may support the application of cuing strategies in PD to enhance attention capability and improve walking gait.",
      "# Title: Investigation of factors impacting mobility and gait in Parkinson disease.\n# Abstract: Mobility and gait limitations are major issues for people with Parkinson disease (PD). Identification of factors that contribute to these impairments may inform treatment and intervention strategies. In this study we investigated factors that predict mobility and gait impairment in PD. Participants with mild to moderate PD and without dementia (n=114) were tested in one session 'off' medication. Mobility measures included the 6-Minute Walk test and Timed-Up-and-Go. Gait velocity was collected in four conditions: forward preferred speed, forward dual task, forward fast as possible and backward walking. The predictors analyzed were age, gender, disease severity, balance, balance confidence, fall history, self-reported physical activity, and executive function. Multiple regression models were used to assess the relationships between predictors and outcomes. The predictors, in different combinations for each outcome measure, explained 55.7% to 66.9% of variability for mobility and 39.5% to 52.8% for gait velocity. Balance was the most relevant factor (explaining up to 54.1% of variance in mobility and up to 45.6% in gait velocity). Balance confidence contributed to a lesser extent (2.0% to 8.2% of variance) in all models. Age explained a small percentage of variance in mobility and gait velocity (up to 2.9%). Executive function explained 3.0% of variance during forward walking only. The strong predictive relationships between balance deficits and mobility and gait impairment suggest targeting balance deficits may be particularly important for improving mobility and gait in people with PD, regardless of an individual's age, disease severity, fall history, or other demographic features."

The current study analyzed the clinical significance of this new stage in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Subjects and Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 4045 eligible PTC patients. The patients were divided into four groups according to the extent of ETE: no ETE, ETE into perithyroidal tissue, T3b (ETE into the strap muscles), and ETE beyond the strap muscles. Differences in the clinical characteristics and prognosis of the four groups were assessed. Results: Of these 4045 patients, 2300 (56.9%) had no ETE, 1004 (24.8%) had ETE into perithyroidal tissue, 371 (9.2%) had ETE into the strap muscles, and 370 (9.1%) had ETE beyond the strap muscles. Tumor size, multifocality, lymph node metastasis (LNM), distant metastasis (DM), recurrence, and recurrence-free survival (RFS) between patients with ETE into perithyroidal tissue and patients without ETE did not show differences, but significant differences were observed between patients with T3b and patients without ETE, and only patients with ETE beyond the strap muscles had significantly worse overall survival (OS) than the other three groups. However, T3b did not independently predict worse RFS in univariable and multivariable analyses. Conclusions: T3b, distinguished from minimal ETE, may be related to larger tumor size, higher prevalence of multifocality, LNM, DM, recurrence, and worse RFS than no ETE, but it may not affect OS and may not independently predict recurrence in PTC patients.",
      "# Title: Is There a Difference Between Minimal and Gross Extension into the Strap Muscles for the Risk of Recurrence in Papillary Thyroid Carcinomas?\n# Abstract: Background: The morbidity of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is primarily related to locoregional recurrences and distant metastases. The definition of minimal extrathyroidal extension (mETE) has been recently revised. The presence of mETE does not impact mortality and is generally not considered to be a predictor for the risk of recurrence. This study aimed at comparing the risk of recurrence and the response to therapy of PTC with mETE and gross extrathyroidal extension (ETE) into the strap muscles (gETE) with low- and intermediate-risk PTC without ETE (low risk w/o ETE and intermediate risk w/o ETE, respectively) to further characterize the impact of ETE on outcomes. Methods: A total of 596 PTCs were analyzed according to the degree of ETE as well as other predictors of recurrence. Four groups of patients were compared, low risk w/o ETE (n = 251), intermediate risk w/o ETE (n = 89), mETE (n = 191), and gETE (n = 65), to determine the risk of recurrence and the response to treatment. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate associations between groups and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: The risk of recurrence was 3% in low risk w/o ETE PTC, 14% in intermediate risk w/o ETE, 14% in mETE, and 25% in gETE. The recurrence risk was increased by the presence of ETE (odds ratio [OR] = 2.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-5.85, p = 0.005) and lymph node metastases (OR = 2.44 [95% CI 1.25-4.76], p = 0.009). Patients with low-risk carcinomas w/o ETE experienced longer DFS than those with mETE (hazard ratio = 0.08 [95% CI 0.02-0.28], p < 0.001), but no significant difference was observed between intermediate risk w/o ETE, mETE, and gETE. In terms of the response to therapy, patients with gETE had higher rates of biochemical and/or structural incomplete responses within the first year of treatment (OR = 2.68 [95% CI 1.31-5.45], p = 0.007) and at the final follow-up evaluation (OR = 4.35 [95% CI 1.99-9.51], p < 0.001) compared with those with mETE. An analysis of the subgroups of microcarcinomas without lymph node metastases revealed no significant difference in DFS or the response to therapy between the low risk w/o ETE and mETE PTC groups. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that both mETE and gETE are independent risk factors for the risk of recurrence in PTC. Although gETE has a more pronounced impact on the recurrence risk and is associated with a worse response to therapy, mETE may not be associated with a low risk of recurrence. This observation suggests that patients with PTC and mETE may, in part, have an intermediate risk of recurrence and need to be followed accordingly."

Consecutive adult NAFLD patients who had a liver biopsy were included. Serum WFA+-M2BP level was measured using a lectin-antibody sandwich immunoassay using a chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay machine (HISCL-5000, Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). The measured levels were indexed using the following equation: Cut-off index (COI) = ([WFA+-M2BP]sample-[WFA+-M2BP]NC) / ([WFA+-M2BP]PC-[WFA+-M2BP]NC), where PC = positive control and NC = negative control. Histopathological examination of liver biopsy specimen was reported according to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Clinical Research Network Scoring System. Data for 220 cases were analyzed. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of NASH was 0.65. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of steatosis grade ≥2 and 3 was 0.64 and 0.53, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of lobular inflammation grade ≥1, ≥2 and 3 was 0.57, 0.68 and 0.59, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of hepatocyte ballooning grade ≥1 and 2 was 0.64 and 0.65, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of fibrosis stage ≥1, ≥2, ≥3 and 4 was 0.61, 0.71, 0.74 and 0.84, respectively.

We assessed its efficacy in evaluating liver disease severity in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in Taiwan. The association between WFA+-M2BP and histological features was evaluated among those CHC patients underwent liver biopsy. We also aimed to clarify the factors determining the performance of WFA+-M2BP in CHC. A total of 229 CHC patients were consecutively recruited. The mean value of WFA+-M2BP in patients from F0 to F4 was 1.68, 2.23, 3.45, 3.48, 3.77 respectively (linear trend P = 0.008). Linear regression analysis revealed that alanine aminotransferase (odds ratio [OR]: 0.03, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.02-0.05, P < 0.001), AST (OR: -0.1, 95% CI: -0.02 to -0.01, P < 0.001), and liver fibrosis (OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.01-0.59, P = 0.043) were the independent factors correlated to serum WFA+-M2BP level.

The diagnostic performances were evaluated of the platelet (PLT) count; the levels of hyaluronan, serum 7S domain of type 4 collagen, procollagen type III N-terminal peptide, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1, Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) and N-terminal type III collagen propeptide (Pro-C3); the fibrosis index based on four factors; the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index; and enhanced liver fibrosis score for identifying significant liver fibrosis [≥fibrosis stage 2 (F2)]. All fibrosis biomarkers, except the Pro-C3 level, correlated with the fibrosis stage. M2BPGi was better than other biomarkers for diagnosing ≥F2, with the highest area under the curve of 0.902. M2BPGi demonstrated a higher diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis than mild/severe fibrosis or cirrhosis. However, no significant correlation was observed between the M2BPGi level and fibrosis stage in patients with CHB having significant liver necroinflammation defined as ≥ necroinflammatory activity 2. The M2BPGi level and PLT count were exclusively correlated with the fibrosis stage in 73 patients without significant liver necroinflammation. M2BPGi demonstrated the highest diagnostic performance for significant fibrosis in patients having significant liver fibrosis with no significant liver necroinflammation. In conclusion, the M2BPGi level can accurately diagnose significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB.",

This study evaluated the performance of WFA+ -M2BP in predicting fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. A total of 80 patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) were enrolled. Serum WFA+ -M2BP levels were measured using standard methods. The fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index was also measured. The mean values of WFA+ -M2BP were 1.0, 1.0, 0.8, and 2.2 in Metavir fibrosis stage F0, F1, F2, and F3-4, respectively (linear trend p = 0.005). The optimal cut-off value of WFA+ -M2BP in predicting advanced fibrosis (F3-4) was 1.37 cut-off index (COI), yielding the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, and accuracy of 75.0, 79.4, 39.1, 94.7, and 78.7%, respectively (p < 0.001). Combining WFA+ -M2BP with FIB-4 significantly increased the diagnostic performance for advanced fibrosis, yielding specificity, PPV, and accuracy of 100, 100, and 93%, respectively. The significant factors predicting advanced liver fibrosis in the multivariate regression analysis were WFA+ -M2BP ≥ 1.37 COI (OR/confidence interval [CI]: 9.49/1.63-55.21, p = 0.01) and FIB-4 ≥ 2.80 (OR/CI: 38.18/4.89-297.93, p = 0.001). Monitoring WFA+ -M2BP is suitable for noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis in NASH patients, particularly in combination with FIB-4."

A total of 80 patients with acute cerebral infarction who were treated at our hospital were randomly selected. They were divided into groups A and B. The two groups were treated with intravenous thrombolysis, while group B received sub-hypothermia treatment. Prior to treatment and at 7 days after treatment, 5 ml of venous blood was collected and stored in a freezer at -80˚C. IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 levels were detected by ELISA and compared between the groups and time-points. The results were as follows: i) At 7 days after treatment, the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in group B were significantly decreased compared with those in group A (P<0.05), while there was no significant difference of these levels between group A and B before treatment (P>0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions in group A and group B was 35 and 20% respectively, and the mortality rate was 10 and 5%, respectively. There were no significant differences in adverse events and mortality between the two groups (P>0.05). In addition, a positive correlation of the level of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was determined in the patients prior to treatment. In conclusion, mild hypothermia treatment in addition to intravenous thrombolysis significantly reduced the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in patients with acute cerebral infarction and reduced inflammation, and should therefore be incorporated in clinical practice.",

A retrospective study of 103 patients.\n# Abstract: A retrospective study of 103 patients with essential thrombocythemia was carried out to evaluate the incidence of thrombohemorrhagic complications and establish whether there were any correlations between these events and clinical or laboratory data. At onset or during the course of the disease, 26 patients (25.2%) presented thrombotic and 12 (11.6%) hemorrhagic complications: among the latter, six patients had gastrointestinal bleeding during antiaggregant therapy. No significant correlations were observed between thrombohemorrhagic complications and platelet count, age, sex, platelet function, bleeding time, or therapeutic regimen. However, there was a statistically significant correlation between a positive patient history for thrombotic events and an increase in thromboses. In agreement with other authors, it is believed that the best approach in asymptomatic patients is strict surveillance without treatment. Chemotherapy and/or treatment with antiaggregant agents should be reserved for symptomatic patients or patients with a positive history for thrombotic events.",
      "# Title: Clinical course of essential thrombocythemia in 147 cases.\n# Abstract: The authors retrospectively analyzed the initial characteristics, treatment, and clinical course in 147 patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET). Median age was 60 years and the M:F ratio was 0.69. At diagnosis, 53 patients were asymptomatic; 50 patients had functional symptoms (mainly vasomotor disturbances); 27 patients had large vessel thrombosis; 27 patients had a bleeding diathesis; and seven patients had both bleeding and thrombosis. The platelet count ranged from 0.7 to 2.92 X 10(12)/l. Forty-five of the 61 tested patients (61%) had prolonged bleeding time and/or platelet hypoaggregation. Three patients had in vitro spontaneous aggregation. No significant correlations were found between hemostatic findings and in vivo bleeding or thrombosis. The incidence of bleeding, however, was higher in patients with more than 2 x 10(12)/l platelets. Of 87 karyotypes performed with banding techniques, only four were abnormal. One hundred twenty-nine patients received one or more cytoreductive agents at diagnosis or during follow-up. Sixty patients received an antiaggregating agent. First-line therapy was radiophosphorus (32P) in 22 patients; busulfan in 35 patients; and hydroxyurea in 72 patients. Hydroxyurea required continuous maintenance therapy and had to be changed to another treatment in 12 of the initial responders because of inadequate control of thrombocythemia. During follow-up, 14 treated patients experienced one or several major thrombotic events. Two untreated patients also had major thrombosis. Only one major bleeding event was seen during follow-up. Median actuarial survival was 73.5% at 7 years and only one patient progressed to acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). These results suggest that large vessel thrombosis is the main complication of ET. It appears largely unpredictable in a given patient at diagnosis but can be largely prevented by the control of thrombocythemia. Because of the low incidence of side effects of treatment in this experience, the authors believe that cytoreductive therapy is indicated in most patients with ET, as long as a group of patients with very low risk of thrombosis is not defined in prospective studies.",

Seventy-seven patients had vascular risk factors, and 37 a history of MVC at ET diagnosis. Forty-nine MVC were registered in 33 patients during the follow-up period. The actuarial probability of MVC was 27% at 6 years in the whole series, 35.6% for patients above 60 years, and 21.4% for patients younger than 60 years, whereas only one of the 36 patients younger than 45 years had MVC. At multivariate analysis, age >60 years, history of major ischemia and hypercholesterolemia were the variables associated with an increased MVC risk. These results suggest that all ET patients above 60 years should be treated, whereas in younger patients treatment decisions should be primarily based on the existence of risk factors for MVC.",
      "# Title: Thrombosis and bleeding in myeloproliferative disorders: identification of at-risk patients with whole blood platelet aggregation studies.\n# Abstract: Seventy-five patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders were studied to investigate platelet function by simultaneous measurement of platelet aggregation by the impedance method and ATP dense granule release using a whole blood platelet lumi-aggregometer, in an attempt to identify patients at risk for thrombosis and bleeding. Thirty-nine patients had at least one abnormal result indicating platelet hyperactivity (i.e. impedance or release with one agonist being above the reference range); 16 patients had platelet hypoactivity (i.e. at least one result was below the reference range), whilst 14 had co-existence of hyper- and hypoactivity. Six patients had normal results. 20/53 patients with platelet hyperactivity (alone or mixed) had a positive history of venous and/or arterial thrombosis; in comparison, only two of the other 22 patients had a positive history. During a median follow-up of 33 months, nine patients with and one patient without platelet hyperactivity respectively developed new thrombotic events before the addition of specific therapy. A total of 50 patients with and eight patients without platelet hyperactivity respectively received specific treatment including aspirin and/or cytotoxic therapy. All but one elderly patient with platelet hyperactivity have remained free of new thrombotic events on specific therapy. Two of the 17 patients with platelet hypoactivity had major clinical bleeding. These observations highlight the need to test platelets for hyper- as well as hypo-function and suggest a useful role for routine whole blood platelet aggregation studies to identify the patients at risk for thrombosis or bleeding.",
      "# Title: Incidence, clinical features and outcome of essential thrombocythaemia in a well defined geographical area.\n# Abstract: In an attempt to characterise the clinical features, incidence and outcome of essential thrombocythaemia (ET) we report our experience in a large unselected series of patients from a well defined region. All new cases of ET in the County of Copenhagen were registered during the period 1977-98. We identified 96 cases of ET, yielding an age- and sex-adjusted annual incidence rate of 0.59/100.000 and a point-prevalence at last follow up of 11/100.000. The overall incidence rate was 0.31 and 1.00 per 100.000 population during the consecutive periods 1977-89 and 1990-98, respectively, corresponding to a 3.2-fold increase. Median age at diagnosis was 67 yr (females 68 yr, males 66 yr, range 18-87 yr), and the female to male (F/M) ratio was 2.6:1. At diagnosis, 52% of the patients displayed no ET-related symptoms and were discovered fortuitously by a routine platelet count. Forty-eight percent presented with thrombohaemorrhagic phenomena, of which microvascular disturbances of the central nervous system (CNS), extremities and skin were most frequently observed (23%). Compared to patients diagnosed after 1989, patients diagnosed before 1990 had a significantly higher mean platelet count, white blood cell (WBC) count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) value and alkaline phosphatase value. With a median follow up of 70 months, 5-yr survival was 76%, significantly lower than the expected survival of an age- and sex-matched control group (p = 0.0052). Thirty-seven patients experienced a total of 55 thrombohaemorrhagic events during follow-up, corresponding to an incidence of thrombosis and microvascular disturbances or haemorrhage of 8.1% per pt-yr and 2.5% per pt-yr, respectively. The number of patients experiencing thrombosis or microvascular disturbances was significantly higher among the 29 patients who never received acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) compared to the 67 patients who received ASA during follow up (45% vs. 21%; p = 0.017). This study provides population-based data suggesting the benefit of treatment with low-dose ASA in a non-selected population of patients with ET.",

In 18 (11.6%) of 155 patients diagnosed with IM in a single institution, 31 thrombotic events (19 arterial, 12 venous) were registered after a mean follow-up of 4.2 (s.d.: 4.5) years. In six patients, the thrombosis was simultaneous to or appeared a few months before IM diagnosis and 14 had one or more thrombotic episodes. When compared with the general population, a significant increase was observed in the incidence of venous thrombosis (odds ratio 17.5, 95% confidence interval: 10.3-31.4). At multivariate analysis, the initial variables associated with an increased risk of thrombosis were thrombocytosis (platelets >450 x 10(9)/l, P=0.001), presence of one cardiovascular risk factor (arterial hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes, P=0.003), cellular phase of myelofibrosis (P=0.005), and Hb >11 g/dl (P=0.02). Considering post-diagnosis events, the 5-year thrombosis-free survival probability was 90.4% in the series, 80.6% for patients with platelets >450 x 10(9)/l, 82.6% for patients with one cardiovascular risk factor, and 85.1% for those in cellular phase. These results indicate an increased thrombotic risk for IM patients with hyperproliferative features and/or coexistent cardiovascular risk factors.",

      "# Title: Leukocytosis is a risk factor for thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia: interaction with treatment, standard risk factors, and Jak2 mutation status.\n# Abstract: Leukocytes contribute to the pathogenesis of thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia (ET) through recently discovered mechanisms of activation and interaction with platelets and endothelial cells. To evaluate whether an increased leukocyte count was associated with thrombosis and whether this effect can be modulated by therapy, we analyzed the clinical course of 439 patients with ET followed at the Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo. The strength of the association was measured at diagnosis or before thrombotic events by multivariable analyses carried out using data at baseline as well as time-varying covariates. The results showed that (1) an increased leukocyte count at diagnosis was associated with thrombosis during follow-up (\"baseline analysis,\" relative risk [RR] 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-3.9, P = .001); (2) hydroxyurea (HU) lowered leukocytosis and reduced the strength of the association between leukocytosis and thrombosis (\"time-dependent analysis,\" RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.9-2.0, not significant [NS]); (3) the association of leukocytosis and thrombosis was more evident in untreated low-risk patients (RR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-6.4, P = .01) compared with HU-treated high-risk patients (RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.8-3.2, NS); and (4) the presence of JAK2 V617F was not identified as a risk factor for thrombosis during follow-up despite a significant association between the mutation and leukocytosis. We suggest validation of these findings in prospective clinical studies.",
      "# Title: Clinical profile of homozygous JAK2 617V>F mutation in patients with polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia.\n# Abstract: JAK2 617V>F mutation occurs in a homozygous state in 25% to 30% of patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and 2% to 4% with essential thrombocythemia (ET). Whether homozygosity associates with distinct clinical phenotypes is still under debate. This retrospective multicenter study considered 118 JAK2 617V>F homozygous patients (104 PV, 14 ET) whose clinical characteristics were compared with those of 587 heterozygous and 257 wild-type patients. Irrespective of their clinical diagnosis, homozygous patients were older, displayed a higher leukocyte count and hematocrit value at diagnosis, and presented larger spleen volume. Aquagenic pruritus was significantly more common among homozygous PV patients. JAK2 617V>F homozygosity associated with more frequent evolution into secondary myelofibrosis in both PV and ET. After adjustment for sex, age, leukocyte count, and previous thrombosis in a multivariate analysis, homozygous ET patients displayed a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio [HR] 3.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-11.7; P = .013) than wild-type (HR = 1.0) or heterozygous patients (HR = 1.49). No significant association of JAK2 617V>F homozygosity with thrombosis risk was observed in PV. Finally, JAK2 617V>F homozygous patients were more likely to receive chemotherapy for control of disease. We conclude that JAK2 617V>F homozygosity identifies PV or ET patients with a more symptomatic myeloproliferative disorder and is associated with a higher risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with ET.",

However, its prognostic relevance to clinical outcome is not completely understood. We investigated the association of JAK2 V617F with vascular events in Korean patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). We studied 283 patients from 15 centers, who were diagnosed with MPN. The JAK2 V617F status was evaluated by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. The patients' diagnoses were essential thrombocythemia (ET n = 146), polycythemia vera (PV n = 120), primary myelofibrosis (n = 12), and unclassifiable MPN (MPNu n = 5). JAK2 V617F was detected in 89 (61%) patients with ET, 103 (86%) with PV, four (33%) with myelofibrosis, and four (80%) with MPNu. A higher number of leukocytes, haemoglobin levels and BM cellularity as well as an older age, lower platelet counts, and diagnosis of PV were significantly correlated with JAK2 V617F. Eighty-three and 43 episodes of thrombosis and bleeding occurred in 100 patients each before and after the diagnosis. Vascular events more frequently occurred in 37% of patients with JAK2 V617F than in 29% of those without the mutation (p = 0.045). Among 175 patients whose samples were available for sequencing, 28 patients with homozygous JAK2 V617F had vascular events more frequently (57%) than those who were heterozygotes (39%) or had the wild type (27%) (p = 0.03). The multivariate analysis showed that a JAK2 homozygous mutation, hypercholesterolemia and older age were independent risk factors for a vascular event. The results of this study showed that Korean patients with MPN had a similar JAK2 mutation rate and frequency of vascular events when compared to Western patients. The presence of V617F was significantly related to vascular events. Therefore, initial evaluation for the JAK2 mutation and careful monitoring for vascular events should be performed in MPN patients.",
      "# Title: Thrombosis in primary myelofibrosis: incidence and risk factors.\n# Abstract: We assessed frequency and predictive factors for major cardiovascular (CV) events in 707 patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) followed in 4 European institutions. A total of 236 deaths (33%) were recorded for an overall mortality of 7.7% patient-years (pt-yr). Fatal and nonfatal thromboses were registered in 51 (7.2%) patients, with a rate of 1.75% pt-yr. If deaths from non-CV causes were considered as competing events, we estimated that the adjusted rate of major thrombotic events would have been 2.2% pt-yr. In a multivariable model, age older than 60 years (hazard ratio [HR], 2.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-4.39, P = .01) and JAK2 mutational status (HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.10-3.34; P = .02) were significantly associated with thrombosis, whereas the strength of the association between leukocyte count higher than 15 x 10(9)/L and CV events was of borderline significance (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 0.97-2.72; P = .06). The highest incidence of fatal and nonfatal thrombosis was observed when the mutation was present along with leukocytosis (3.9% pt-yr; HR, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.26-7.81). This study is the largest hitherto carried out in this setting and shows that the rate of major CV events in PMF is comparable with that reported in essential thrombocythemia, and it is increased in aged patients and those with JAK2 V617F mutation and leukocytosis.",
      "# Title: Thrombosis in myelofibrosis: prior thrombosis is the only predictive factor and most venous events are provoked.\n# Abstract: In a retrospective analysis of 205 patients (median age 62 years) with primary myelofibrosis and known JAK2V617F mutational status, 13.2% experienced a vaso-occlusive event at or prior to their diagnosis. After a median follow up of 31 months, post-diagnosis thrombosis occurred in 22 patients (10.7%), including 9 (4.4%) and 16 (7.8%) patients with a total of 9 arterial and 24 venous events, respectively. The majority (71%) of the venous events were temporally associated with other exogenous risk factors for thrombosis such as surgery, line placement or hormonal therapy. On multivariable analysis that included age, JAK2V617F mutation status and leukocyte count as covariates, history of thrombosis was the only predictive variable in general (P=0.04) or when arterial (P=0.007) and venous (P=0.02) thromboses were analyzed separately. The current study demonstrates a higher prevalence of venous, as opposed to arterial, events in PMF, post-diagnosis, and clarifies their nature as being mostly provoked.",
      "# Title: Impact of leukocytosis on thrombotic risk and survival in 532 patients with essential thrombocythemia: a retrospective study.\n# Abstract: Established risk factors for thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia (ET) include age (≥ 60 years) and previous vascular events. Recently, also leukocytosis has been proposed in risk stratification of ET patients. We report a retrospective study on 532 ET patients followed for a median of 7.6 years. Sixty-four patients (12%) developed 95 thrombotic events during follow-up. Together with the high-risk condition, a white blood cell (WBC) value above 11 × 10⁹/L, corresponding to the fourth percentile value, significantly correlated with a higher thrombotic risk (p = 0.033) by Cox proportional hazards. Moreover, the cumulative risk of thrombosis was significantly higher in high-risk patients with WBC >11 × 10⁹/L. JAK2 V617F mutation did not correlate with thrombosis. Overall, 123 (23%) patients died. Three independent parameters were noted as prognostic factors for survival in multivariate analysis: age > 60 years, leukocytosis >11 × 10⁹/L, and hemoglobin level below normal values. Based on these parameters, three groups of risk were defined, with significantly different survivals. Baseline leukocytosis correlated with a higher thrombotic risk in high-risk patients and identified a cohort of patients with worse survival.",
      "# Title: Incidence and risk factors for bleeding in 1104 patients with essential thrombocythemia or prefibrotic myelofibrosis diagnosed according to the 2008 WHO criteria.\n# Abstract: In an international study of 1104 patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET), a histological review according to the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria confirmed ET in 891 patients (WHO-ET, 81%), and revised the diagnosis to prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis (PMF) in 180 patients (PMF, 16%). Major bleeding during follow-up occurred in 55 (6%) WHO-ET and 21 (12%) PMF patients (P = 0.009), at a rate of 0.79 and 1.39% patients per year, respectively, (P = 0.039). In a multivariable analysis, predictors of bleeding included diagnosis of PMF (P = 0.05; hazard ratio (HR) 1.74), leukocytosis (P = 0.04; HR 1.74), previous hemorrhage (P = 0.025; HR 2.35) and aspirin therapy (P=0.001; HR 3.16). The analysis restricted to patients with WHO-ET confirmed previous hemorrhage (P = 0.043; HR 1.92) and aspirin (P=0.027; HR 2.24) as independent risk factors. The current study reveals that major bleeding associated with thrombocytosis might be relatively specific to PMF, as opposed to WHO-defined ET. Furthermore, it shows that low-dose aspirin exacerbates these hemorrhagic events of PMF. In contrast, thrombocytosis per se was not a risk factor for bleeding; however, low-dose aspirin had a synergistic hemorrhagic effect unmasking the bleeding tendency of patients with extreme thrombocytosis. These observations carry significant therapeutic implications in these two WHO entities.",
      "# Title: Leukocytosis as an important risk factor for arterial thrombosis in WHO-defined early/prefibrotic myelofibrosis: an international study of 264 patients.\n# Abstract: We aimed to determine risk factors for thrombotic events in early/prefibrotic myelofibrosis diagnosed according to the World Health Organization criteria. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was calculated on a total number of 264 patients derived from an international database. After a median follow-up of 6.28 years, 42 (15.9%) patients experienced arterial (n = 31) or venous thrombosis (n = 11). A higher leukocyte count correlated with an increased risk for total thrombosis and in particular, with an increased risk for arterial thrombosis (P = 0.005, HR 1.15 and P = 0.047, HR 1.12, respectively). A platelet count above 870 × 10⁹/L was associated with a lower risk for total thrombosis and also for venous thrombosis (P = 0.022, HR 0.44 and P = 0.027, HR 0.19). Moreover, a lower hemoglobin level was associated with an increased risk for venous thrombosis (P = 0.007, HR 0.59). Our data indicate that leukocytosis is a prominent risk factor for thrombosis in early/prefibrotic MF.",

Due to the morbidity and mortality of these events, antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant agents are commonly employed as primary and/or secondary prophylaxis. On the other hand, disease-related bleeding complications (i.e., from esophageal varices) are common in patients with MPN. This analysis was performed to define the frequency of such events, identify risk factors, and assess antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy in a cohort of patients with MPN.",

      "# Title: Thromboses and hemorrhages are common in MPN patients with high JAK2V617F allele burden.\n# Abstract: The most common causes of morbidity and mortality in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications. The JAK2V617F mutation, commonly found in MPN, correlates with several clinical and laboratory characteristics even if the relevance of JAK2V617F allele burden in the natural history of these diseases is unclear. In this study we searched, a relation between thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications and JAK2V617F allele burden level in MPN patients. We evaluated 253 consecutive MPN [121 essential thrombocythemia (ET), 124 polycythemia vera (PV), and 8 primary myelofibrosis (PMF)] patients in whom the JAK2V617F allele burden was available, all studied and followed (median 8.8 years) in our department. Patients were stratified accordingly to their JAK2V617F allele burden, into four quartiles (1st <25%, 2nd 26-50%, 3rd 51-75%, and 4th >75%). Significantly higher incidence of thromboses (p = 0.001) and hemorrhages (p < 0.001) during follow-up has been observed in higher quartiles when compared to lower ones. Thrombosis- and hemorrhage-free survivals were poorer in patients belonging to the highest quartile. Our data suggest that MPN patients with JAK2V617F allele burden higher than 75% have to be considered as high risk patients, being prone to develop thrombo-hemorrhagic complications during the disease course.",
      "# Title: Risk factors for arterial versus venous thrombosis in polycythemia vera: a single center experience in 587 patients.\n# Abstract: In a recent International Working Group on Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) study, prior arterial events and hypertension were predictors of subsequent arterial thrombosis whereas prior venous events and age ≥65 years predicted venous thrombosis in polycythemia vera (PV). In the current study, we sought to validate the above findings and identify additional predictors of arterial versus venous thrombosis. At a median follow up of 109 months, thrombosis after diagnosis occurred in 128 (22%) patients; 82 (14%) arterial and 57 (10%) venous events. On multivariate analysis, prior arterial events (<0.0001), hyperlipidemia (p = 0.03), and hypertension (p = 0.02) predicted subsequent arterial events. In comparison, prior venous events (p = 0.05), leukocytosis ≥11 × 109/L (p = 0.002), and major hemorrhage (p = 0.02) were predictors of subsequent venous events. Salient associations with arterial thrombosis included age ≥ 60 years, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and normal karyotype whereas age ≤ 60 years, females, palpable splenomegaly and history of major hemorrhage were associated with venous thrombosis. TET2 or ASXL1 mutations did not impact arterial nor venous thrombosis. In conclusion, we identify distinct associations for arterial versus venous thrombosis in PV and confirm that a prior arterial or venous thrombotic event is the most reliable predictor of subsequent events.",
      "# Title: Evaluation of vascular events in patients with myeloproliferative syndromes and mutations of either the januskinase-2 or calreticulin gene at the university hospital Krems from 2008 to 2015.\n# Abstract: Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), classified as polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis (ET) and myelofibrosis (MF) are stem-cell derived disorders. Mutations in either the januskinase-2 (JAK-2) or the calreticulin (CALR) gene are characteristic for MPN and may result in enhanced proliferation of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets, and thus increase the risk for vascular events. This study is a retrospective and descriptive analysis of records of patients, who underwent treatment for myeloproliferative syndromes at the Department of Hemato-Oncology of the University hospital Krems from 2008 to the end of 2015. Out of 250 patients, who were suspected for MPN, 51 patients displayed a JAK-2 V617F mutation. These were analyzed with regard to their blood values, gender, age at diagnosis, therapy and vascular events before and after diagnosis (during therapy). Of the 51 patients diagnosed with MPN and a JAK-2 V617F mutation, 33 suffered from PV, 15 from ET and 3 from MF. More men than women were diagnosed with MPN and the median age at diagnosis was 72 years. Acetylsalicylic acid, phlebotomy and Hydroxyurea were the most frequent therapies applied. In our study cohort, the most common vascular events were acute coronary syndrome and transitory ischemic attack. Thromboembolic events were effectively reduced by MPN therapy while no elevation in bleeding events could be observed.",
      "# Title: Clinico-hematological profile and thrombotic/hemorrhagic events in 150 chinese patients with essential thrombocythemia.\n# Abstract: Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is an uncommon chronic myeloproliferative disorder with no cure. Patients with ET are at risk of different complications, and currently there are no optimal prognostic standards to predict severe post-diagnosis complications such as thrombosis and hemorrhage. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the full set of clinical data from 150 Chinese patients with ET enrolled from 2013 to 2016. We discovered that neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), along with other known clinical parameters such as age, leukocyte count, incidence of thrombotic events is higher in patients with JAK2 V617F mutation. NLR is also higher in patients at high-risk stratification of thrombosis. Multivariate analysis showed that age (P = 0.001, 95% CI 1.023-1.089) and JAK2 V617F mutation (P = 0.003, 95% CI 1.837-21.035) were independent factors for thrombotic events, while age (P = 0.005, 95% CI 1.019-1.111) was the only predictive factor for hemorrhagic events at diagnosis. For future thrombotic events, multivariate analysis revealed NLR as the best predictive parameter (P < 0.001, 95% CI 1.173-1.486) when compared with other clinical parameters such as age (P = 0.037, 95% CI 1.004-1.126), thrombosis at diagnosis (P = 0.036, 95% CI 1.077-9.099) and WBC count (P = 0.047, 95% CI 1.001-1.109). Further ROC curve and Kaplan Meier analysis validated NLR as better prognostic marker for future thrombotic events and thrombosis-free survival. In summary, our data suggest that NLR parameter may possess great prognostic significance for future thrombosis in ET patients."

      "conclusionB": "**Primary Concluding Statement:**\n\nAmong patients with Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), including essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), there is a significantly increased risk of both thrombosis and hemorrhage. Key risk factors identified across multiple studies include older age (particularly >60 years), history of prior vascular events (thrombotic or hemorrhagic), leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count), JAK2 V617F mutation status (especially homozygosity in ET), and specific disease characteristics like cellular phase in myelofibrosis or high platelet counts in ET. Low-dose aspirin is associated with a reduced risk of thrombosis in ET, though it may increase bleeding risk, particularly in PMF. Interventions like cytoreductive therapy and antiplatelet agents are used to mitigate these risks, and specific risk stratification models (e.g., IPSET, IPSET-Thrombosis) have been developed to guide management."

Torture history in clinic populations correlated with hunger and posttraumatic stress disorder, although in small, nonrepresentative samples. One study observed that previous exposure to interpersonal violence interacted with longer immigration detention periods, resulting in higher depression scores. Limited evidence suggests that asylum seekers frequently experience violence and health problems, but large-scale studies are needed to inform policies and services for this vulnerable group often at the center of political debate.",
      "# Title: Sexual and reproductive health of migrants: does the EU care?\n# Abstract: The European Union (EU) refers to health as a human right in many internal and external communications, policies and agreements, defending its universality. In parallel, specific health needs of migrants originating from outside the EU have been acknowledged. Yet, their right to health and in particular sexual and reproductive health (SRH) is currently not ensured throughout the EU. This paper reflects on the results of a comprehensive literature review on migrants' SRH in the EU applying the Critical Interpretive Synthesis review method. We highlight the discrepancy between a proclaimed rights-based approach to health and actual obstacles to migrants' attainment of good SRH. Uncertainties on entitlements of diverse migrant groups are fuelled by unclear legal provisions, creating significant barriers to access health systems in general and SRH services in particular. Furthermore, the rare strategies addressing migrants' health fail to address sexual health and are generally limited to perinatal care and HIV screening. Thus, future European public health policy-making should not only strongly encourage its Member States to ensure equal access to health care for migrants as for EU citizens, but also promote migrants' SRH effectively through a holistic and inclusive approach in SRH policies, prevention and care.",
      "# Title: Evaluating the impact of immigration policies on health status among undocumented immigrants: a systematic review.\n# Abstract: Over the past two decades, new anti-immigration policies and laws have emerged to address the migration of undocumented immigrants. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to assess and understand how these immigration policies and laws may affect both access to health services and health outcomes among undocumented immigrants. Eight databases were used to conduct this review, which returned 325 papers that were assessed for validity based on specified inclusion criteria. Forty critically appraised articles were selected for analysis; thirty articles related to access to health services, and ten related to health outcomes. The articles showed a direct relationship between anti-immigration policies and their effects on access to health services. In addition, as a result of these policies, undocumented immigrants were impacted by mental health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Action items were presented, including the promotion of cultural diversity training and the development of innovative strategies to support safety-net health care facilities serving vulnerable populations.",

HIV testing may improve these outcomes. We reviewed and synthesised studies into migrants and HIV testing (outcome variable), published between January 1997 and April 2014. Papers using quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods designs, and samples with adult (≥18 years) migrants from low- and middle-income countries in high-income countries were included in the paper. Of 3155 papers retrieved, 31 met the inclusion criteria and are included in the review. A large number of barriers and facilitators to HIV testing were identified across the individual, social and structural levels. A number of study design and methodological issues, however, inhibited a comprehensive synthesis. There is no doubt that addressing HIV testing in migrants in high-income countries is complex; however, it has important implications for individual, community and population health, and a strong, empirically based response is warranted.",

      "# Title: What the eye does not see: a critical interpretive synthesis of European Union policies addressing sexual violence in vulnerable migrants.\n# Abstract: In Europe, refugees, asylum seekers and undocumented migrants are more vulnerable to sexual victimisation than European citizens. They face more challenges when seeking care. This literature review examines how legal and policy frameworks at national, European and international levels condition the prevention of and response to sexual violence affecting these vulnerable migrant communities living in the European Union (EU). Applying the Critical Interpretive Synthesis method, we reviewed 187 legal and policy documents and 80 peer-reviewed articles on migrant sexual health for elements on sexual violence and further analysed the 37 legal and 12 peer-reviewed articles among them that specifically focused on sexual violence in vulnerable migrants in the EU-27 States. Legal and policy documents dealing with sexual violence, particularly but not exclusively in vulnerable migrants, apply 'tunnel vision'. They ignore: a) frequently occurring types of sexual violence, b) victimisation rates across genders and c) specific risk factors within the EU such as migrants' legal status, gender orientation and living conditions. The current EU policy-making paradigm relegates sexual violence in vulnerable migrants as an 'outsider' and 'female only' issue while EU migration and asylum policies reinforce its invisibility. Effective response must be guided by participatory rights- and evidence-based policies and a public health approach, acknowledging the occurrence and multiplicity of sexual victimisation of vulnerable migrants of all genders within EU borders.",
      "# Title: Human Trafficking in Ethiopia: A Scoping Review to Identify Gaps in Service Delivery, Research, and Policy.\n# Abstract: The purpose of this review is to integrate evidence on human trafficking in Ethiopia and identify gaps and recommendations for service delivery, research and training, and policy. A scoping literature review approach was used to systematically search nursing, medical, psychological, law, and international databases and synthesize information on a complex, understudied topic. The search yielded 826 articles, and 39 met the predetermined criteria for inclusion in the review. Trafficking in Ethiopia has occurred internally and externally in the form of adult and child labor and sex trafficking. There were also some reports of organ trafficking and other closely related human rights violations, such as child marriage, child soldiering, and exploitative intercountry adoption. Risk factors for trafficking included push factors (poverty, political instability, economic problems, and gender discrimination) and pull factors (demand for cheap labor). Trafficking was associated with poor health and economic outcomes for victims. Key recommendations for service delivery, research and training, and policy are identified, including establishing comprehensive services for survivor rehabilitation and reintegration, conducting quantitative health outcomes research, and reforming policy around migration and trafficking. Implementing the recommendations identified by this review will allow policy makers, researchers, and practitioners to take meaningful steps toward confronting human trafficking in Ethiopia.",

      "# Title: Factors Influencing the Accuracy of Infectious Disease Reporting in Migrants: A Scoping Review.\n# Abstract: We conducted a scoping review of literature to improve our understanding of the accuracy of infectious disease monitoring in migrants in the Europe. We searched PubMed for papers relevant to the topic including: case reports, observational and experimental studies, reviews, guidelines or policy documents; published after 1994. We identified 532 papers, 27 of which were included in the review. Legislation and right to access health care influence both the accuracy of rates and risk measures under estimating the at risk population, i.e., the denominator. Furthermore, the number of reported cases, i.e., the numerator, may also include cases not accounted for in the denominator. Both biases lead to an overestimated disease occurrence. Restriction to healthcare access and low responsiveness may cause under-detection of cases, however a quantification of this phenomenon has not been produced. On the contrary, screening for asymptomatic diseases increases ascertainment leading to increased detection of cases. Incompleteness of denominator data underestimates the at-risk population. In conclusion, most studies show a lower probability of under-reporting infectious diseases in migrants compared with native populations."

    "referenceConclusion": "Our findings show that a consensus must be reached for defining a set of indicators and standards to improve quality in NHs. Establishing the relationship between structural, process, and outcome indicators is a challenge. There are grounds for investigating this theme by means of prospective longitudinal studies that take the risk adjustment into account. Our findings show that there is an open debate regarding the indicators that could be used to describe the quality of nutritional care in NHs. A consensus must be reached to define a set of indicators and a standard to improve the quality in NHs. For this purpose, studies aimed at testing the reliability and validity of the indicators are encouraged. Moreover, the relationships among structural, process, and outcome indicators are a matter of challenge. According to our results, while the prevalence or risk of malnutrition is associated with aspects such as having a policy related to nutritional risk assessment or having suitable scales to weigh the residents, these findings need to be confirmed. In conclusion, there are grounds for investigating this new theme by means of prospective longitudinal studies that also take the risk adjustment into account.",

      "# Title: Future development of nursing home quality indicators.\n# Abstract: Nursing home quality indicators have been developed over the past 10 years to quantify nursing home quality and to draw systematic comparisons between facilities. Although these indicators have been applied widely for nursing home regulation, quality improvement, and public reporting, researchers and stakeholders have raised concerns about their accuracy and usefulness. We critically evaluate nursing home quality indicators from the standpoint of theory, measurement, and application, and we recommend strategies to make the indicators more valuable as quality assessment tools. We recommend that (a) more comprehensive quality indicators should be developed in conjunction with the new Minimum Data Set 3.0; (b) the validity and reliability of the indicators should be evaluated thoroughly with respect to both measurement and application; (c) statistical criteria should be incorporated explicitly into quality indicator scoring and outlier targeting; (d) the dimensionality and theoretical structure of the quality indicators should be carefully examined; (e) risk adjustment methods should be refined and broadened; and (f) quality indicator reporting systems should be strengthened and tailored to stakeholders' needs.",

      "# Title: Nutritional care; do process and structure indicators influence malnutrition prevalence over time?\n# Abstract: To date, no information is available about the effect of structural and process factors of nutritional care on the prevalence of malnutrition over time in the long-term care sector. This study analyzes the trend of malnutrition prevalence rates between 2007 and 2011 in the long-term care sector, and the related effects of(1) process indicators such as nutritional screening and treatment and 2) structural indicators (guideline, protocol or nutritional screening policy). From 2007 to 2011, the Dutch National Prevalence Measurement of Care Problems (LPZ) was performed in Dutch long-term care organizations using a standardized questionnaire involving measurements at institutional, ward and resident level. The data were analyzed by mixed-linear regression for longitudinal data. Presence of malnutrition was assessed by BMI, undesired weight loss and nutritional intake. Seventy-four care homes were included (26,101 residents). The malnutrition prevalence trend significantly decreased (P < 0.001) from 26% to 18% from 2007 to 2011. In the final model of the mixed effects analysis only the interacted process indicators nutritional screening and oral nutritional supplementation (ONS) were significant in influencing malnutrition prevalence rates over time. Structural indicators had no impact on the malnutrition prevalence over time. In conclusion, over time a lower prevalence of malnutrition is associated with a higher degree of nutritional screening. As might be expected, a higher prevalence of malnutrition is associated with higher use of ONS. Structural nutritional screening is an important intervention to tackle the problem of malnutrition in the long term care sector.",

      "# Title: Which characteristics of nursing home residents influence differences in malnutrition prevalence? An international comparison of The Netherlands, Germany and Austria.\n# Abstract: Prevalence rates of malnutrition vary considerably internationally, partly due to differences in measurement methodology and instruments. In the present study, the same measurement methodology and instruments were used in The Netherlands, Germany and Austria. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether resident characteristics influence possible differences in malnutrition prevalence between countries. The study followed a cross-sectional, multi-centre design that measured malnutrition in nursing home residents from The Netherlands, Germany and Austria. Resident data were gathered using a standardised questionnaire. Malnutrition was operationalised using BMI, unintentional weight loss and nutritional intake. Data were analysed using an association model. The prevalence rates of malnutrition in The Netherlands, Germany and Austria were 18·3, 20·1 and 22·5 %, respectively. The multivariate generalised estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression analysis showed that sex, age, care dependency, the mean number of diseases and some specific diseases were influencing factors for whether the resident was malnourished or not. The OR of malnutrition in the three countries declined after including the influencing factors resulting from the multivariate GEE analysis. The present study reveals that differences in the prevalence rates of malnutrition in nursing homes in The Netherlands, Germany and Austria are influenced by different resident characteristics. Since other country-related factors could also play an important role in influencing differences in the prevalence rates of malnutrition between the countries (structural and process factors of malnutrition care policy). We recommend the investigation of these factors in future studies.",

      "# Title: Sexual and reproductive health of migrants: does the EU care?\n# Abstract: The European Union (EU) refers to health as a human right in many internal and external communications, policies and agreements, defending its universality. In parallel, specific health needs of migrants originating from outside the EU have been acknowledged. Yet, their right to health and in particular sexual and reproductive health (SRH) is currently not ensured throughout the EU. This paper reflects on the results of a comprehensive literature review on migrants' SRH in the EU applying the Critical Interpretive Synthesis review method. We highlight the discrepancy between a proclaimed rights-based approach to health and actual obstacles to migrants' attainment of good SRH. Uncertainties on entitlements of diverse migrant groups are fuelled by unclear legal provisions, creating significant barriers to access health systems in general and SRH services in particular. Furthermore, the rare strategies addressing migrants' health fail to address sexual health and are generally limited to perinatal care and HIV screening. Thus, future European public health policy-making should not only strongly encourage its Member States to ensure equal access to health care for migrants as for EU citizens, but also promote migrants' SRH effectively through a holistic and inclusive approach in SRH policies, prevention and care.",
      "# Title: Evaluating the impact of immigration policies on health status among undocumented immigrants: a systematic review.\n# Abstract: Over the past two decades, new anti-immigration policies and laws have emerged to address the migration of undocumented immigrants. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to assess and understand how these immigration policies and laws may affect both access to health services and health outcomes among undocumented immigrants. Eight databases were used to conduct this review, which returned 325 papers that were assessed for validity based on specified inclusion criteria. Forty critically appraised articles were selected for analysis; thirty articles related to access to health services, and ten related to health outcomes. The articles showed a direct relationship between anti-immigration policies and their effects on access to health services. In addition, as a result of these policies, undocumented immigrants were impacted by mental health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Action items were presented, including the promotion of cultural diversity training and the development of innovative strategies to support safety-net health care facilities serving vulnerable populations.",

Papers using quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods designs, and samples with adult (≥18 years) migrants from low- and middle-income countries in high-income countries were included in the paper. Of 3155 papers retrieved, 31 met the inclusion criteria and are included in the review. A large number of barriers and facilitators to HIV testing were identified across the individual, social and structural levels. A number of study design and methodological issues, however, inhibited a comprehensive synthesis. There is no doubt that addressing HIV testing in migrants in high-income countries is complex; however, it has important implications for individual, community and population health, and a strong, empirically based response is warranted.",

      "# Title: What the eye does not see: a critical interpretive synthesis of European Union policies addressing sexual violence in vulnerable migrants.\n# Abstract: In Europe, refugees, asylum seekers and undocumented migrants are more vulnerable to sexual victimisation than European citizens. They face more challenges when seeking care. This literature review examines how legal and policy frameworks at national, European and international levels condition the prevention of and response to sexual violence affecting these vulnerable migrant communities living in the European Union (EU). Applying the Critical Interpretive Synthesis method, we reviewed 187 legal and policy documents and 80 peer-reviewed articles on migrant sexual health for elements on sexual violence and further analysed the 37 legal and 12 peer-reviewed articles among them that specifically focused on sexual violence in vulnerable migrants in the EU-27 States. Legal and policy documents dealing with sexual violence, particularly but not exclusively in vulnerable migrants, apply 'tunnel vision'. They ignore: a) frequently occurring types of sexual violence, b) victimisation rates across genders and c) specific risk factors within the EU such as migrants' legal status, gender orientation and living conditions. The current EU policy-making paradigm relegates sexual violence in vulnerable migrants as an 'outsider' and 'female only' issue while EU migration and asylum policies reinforce its invisibility. Effective response must be guided by participatory rights- and evidence-based policies and a public health approach, acknowledging the occurrence and multiplicity of sexual victimisation of vulnerable migrants of all genders within EU borders.",
      "# Title: Human Trafficking in Ethiopia: A Scoping Review to Identify Gaps in Service Delivery, Research, and Policy.\n# Abstract: The purpose of this review is to integrate evidence on human trafficking in Ethiopia and identify gaps and recommendations for service delivery, research and training, and policy. A scoping literature review approach was used to systematically search nursing, medical, psychological, law, and international databases and synthesize information on a complex, understudied topic. The search yielded 826 articles, and 39 met the predetermined criteria for inclusion in the review. Trafficking in Ethiopia has occurred internally and externally in the form of adult and child labor and sex trafficking. There were also some reports of organ trafficking and other closely related human rights violations, such as child marriage, child soldiering, and exploitative intercountry adoption. Risk factors for trafficking included push factors (poverty, political instability, economic problems, and gender discrimination) and pull factors (demand for cheap labor). Trafficking was associated with poor health and economic outcomes for victims. Key recommendations for service delivery, research and training, and policy are identified, including establishing comprehensive services for survivor rehabilitation and reintegration, conducting quantitative health outcomes research, and reforming policy around migration and trafficking. Implementing the recommendations identified by this review will allow policy makers, researchers, and practitioners to take meaningful steps toward confronting human trafficking in Ethiopia.",

      "# Title: Factors Influencing the Accuracy of Infectious Disease Reporting in Migrants: A Scoping Review.\n# Abstract: We conducted a scoping review of literature to improve our understanding of the accuracy of infectious disease monitoring in migrants in the Europe. We searched PubMed for papers relevant to the topic including: case reports, observational and experimental studies, reviews, guidelines or policy documents; published after 1994. We identified 532 papers, 27 of which were included in the review. Legislation and right to access health care influence both the accuracy of rates and risk measures under estimating the at risk population, i.e., the denominator. Furthermore, the number of reported cases, i.e., the numerator, may also include cases not accounted for in the denominator. Both biases lead to an overestimated disease occurrence. Restriction to healthcare access and low responsiveness may cause under-detection of cases, however a quantification of this phenomenon has not been produced. On the contrary, screening for asymptomatic diseases increases ascertainment leading to increased detection of cases. Incompleteness of denominator data underestimates the at-risk population. In conclusion, most studies show a lower probability of under-reporting infectious diseases in migrants compared with native populations."

Our objective was to determine if mFI predicts morbidity and mortality in the diverse national cohort of patients undergoing neurosurgery for intracranial neoplasms. We identified patients in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program who underwent oncologic neurosurgery procedures between 2008 and 2012. The mFI, ranging from 0 to 1, was calculated as the proportion of 11 possible risk factors present. We assessed the associations between mFI and 30-day mortality, neurologic and medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge in univariate and multivariable analyses and compare the index to established risk stratification techniques. A total of 9149 patients were identified. Mortality, severe medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge increased incrementally with increasing levels of frailty. Severe neurologic complications were highest in those with low frailty. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, increased frailty increased the odds of all adverse outcomes, including neurologic complications. The mFI increased the ability to predict all outcomes beyond available indices and was the most reliable predictor of neurologic complications. The mFI can be calculated from routinely collected medical record data and is predictive of 30-day adverse outcomes in a wide variety of neurosurgical oncology patients. The index may be a useful component of preoperative risk assessment with implications for shared decision-making, perioperative planning, and risk adjusted outcomes measurement in national quality registries.",

Few data exist regarding the relationship of frailty with adverse outcomes in craniotomy for brain tumor resection. We assessed the relationship between frailty and the incidence of major post-operative complication, discharge destination other than home, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality after elective craniotomy for brain tumor resection. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 20,333 adult patients undergoing elective craniotomy for tumor resection in the 2012-2018 ACS-NSQIP Participant Use File. Multivariate logistic regression was performed using all covariates deemed eligible through clinical and statistical significance. 6,249 patients (30.7%) were low-frailty and 2,148 patients (10.6%) were medium-to-high frailty. In multivariate logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, BMI, ASA classification, smoking status, dyspnea, significant pre-operative weight loss, chronic steroid use, bleeding disorder, tumor type, and operative time, low frailty was associated with increased adjusted odds ratio of major complication (1.41, 95% CI: 1.23-1.60, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.32, 95% CI: 1.20-1.46, p < 0.001), 30-day readmission (1.29, 95% CI: 1.15-1.44, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (1.87, 95% CI: 1.41-2.47, p < 0.001). Moderate-to-high frailty was also associated with increased adjusted odds of major complication (1.61, 95% CI: 1.35-1.92, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.80, 95% CI: 1.58-2.05), 30-day readmission (1.39, 95% CI: 1.19-1.62, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (2.42, 95% CI: 1.74-3.38, p < 0.001).

      "# Title: Comparisons of forward and backward gait between poorer and better attention capabilities in early Parkinson's disease.\n# Abstract: This study compared forward and backward gait between Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with poorer and better attention capabilities. PD and healthy control (HC) participants received a dual-stimuli attention task. The results were assessed using principal component analysis to quantify and rank attention capability. Accordingly, 22 PD and 42 HC subjects were equally divided into poorer (14 PD-P, 18 HC-P) and better (8 PD-B, 24 HC-B) attention capabilities. To analyze the spatiotemporal gait parameters, each participant walked forwards and backwards on a GAITRite(®) walkway. Compared to HC, PD performed worse in the dual task and exhibited slower velocity, less swing, and shorter stride in both walking directions. Notably, PD-P experienced all these gait defects, regardless of directions. PD-B walked worse than HC-B backwards, and displayed comparable gait to HC-P in both directions. In PD and HC, velocity, stride, and swing decreased perceptibly when walking backwards compared to forwards, and the same was true for velocity and stride in PD-P and PD-B. Backward strides were reduced evidently more in PD-P than in PD-B. However, backward swing reductions in PD-P and PD-B were statistically insignificant. Cadence in both directions was similar within the groups and between the groups, and there were little alterations between directions within each group and between groups. These results suggest that attention capability may affect PD gait. Poorer attention exacerbates gait defects and better attention improves gait in both directions. These results may support the application of cuing strategies in PD to enhance attention capability and improve walking gait.",
      "# Title: Investigation of factors impacting mobility and gait in Parkinson disease.\n# Abstract: Mobility and gait limitations are major issues for people with Parkinson disease (PD). Identification of factors that contribute to these impairments may inform treatment and intervention strategies. In this study we investigated factors that predict mobility and gait impairment in PD. Participants with mild to moderate PD and without dementia (n=114) were tested in one session 'off' medication. Mobility measures included the 6-Minute Walk test and Timed-Up-and-Go. Gait velocity was collected in four conditions: forward preferred speed, forward dual task, forward fast as possible and backward walking. The predictors analyzed were age, gender, disease severity, balance, balance confidence, fall history, self-reported physical activity, and executive function. Multiple regression models were used to assess the relationships between predictors and outcomes. The predictors, in different combinations for each outcome measure, explained 55.7% to 66.9% of variability for mobility and 39.5% to 52.8% for gait velocity. Balance was the most relevant factor (explaining up to 54.1% of variance in mobility and up to 45.6% in gait velocity). Balance confidence contributed to a lesser extent (2.0% to 8.2% of variance) in all models. Age explained a small percentage of variance in mobility and gait velocity (up to 2.9%). Executive function explained 3.0% of variance during forward walking only. The strong predictive relationships between balance deficits and mobility and gait impairment suggest targeting balance deficits may be particularly important for improving mobility and gait in people with PD, regardless of an individual's age, disease severity, fall history, or other demographic features."

      "# Title: The modified frailty index and 30-day adverse events in oncologic neurosurgery.\n# Abstract: The modified frailty index (mFI) is emerging as a leading measure for preoperative risk assessment using routinely available medical record data. Our objective was to determine if mFI predicts morbidity and mortality in the diverse national cohort of patients undergoing neurosurgery for intracranial neoplasms. We identified patients in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program who underwent oncologic neurosurgery procedures between 2008 and 2012. The mFI, ranging from 0 to 1, was calculated as the proportion of 11 possible risk factors present. We assessed the associations between mFI and 30-day mortality, neurologic and medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge in univariate and multivariable analyses and compare the index to established risk stratification techniques. A total of 9149 patients were identified. Mortality, severe medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge increased incrementally with increasing levels of frailty. Severe neurologic complications were highest in those with low frailty. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, increased frailty increased the odds of all adverse outcomes, including neurologic complications. The mFI increased the ability to predict all outcomes beyond available indices and was the most reliable predictor of neurologic complications. The mFI can be calculated from routinely collected medical record data and is predictive of 30-day adverse outcomes in a wide variety of neurosurgical oncology patients. The index may be a useful component of preoperative risk assessment with implications for shared decision-making, perioperative planning, and risk adjusted outcomes measurement in national quality registries.",

Few data exist regarding the relationship of frailty with adverse outcomes in craniotomy for brain tumor resection. We assessed the relationship between frailty and the incidence of major post-operative complication, discharge destination other than home, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality after elective craniotomy for brain tumor resection. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 20,333 adult patients undergoing elective craniotomy for tumor resection in the 2012-2018 ACS-NSQIP Participant Use File. Multivariate logistic regression was performed using all covariates deemed eligible through clinical and statistical significance. 6,249 patients (30.7%) were low-frailty and 2,148 patients (10.6%) were medium-to-high frailty. In multivariate logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, BMI, ASA classification, smoking status, dyspnea, significant pre-operative weight loss, chronic steroid use, bleeding disorder, tumor type, and operative time, low frailty was associated with increased adjusted odds ratio of major complication (1.41, 95% CI: 1.23-1.60, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.32, 95% CI: 1.20-1.46, p < 0.001), 30-day readmission (1.29, 95% CI: 1.15-1.44, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (1.87, 95% CI: 1.41-2.47, p < 0.001). Moderate-to-high frailty was also associated with increased adjusted odds of major complication (1.61, 95% CI: 1.35-1.92, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.80, 95% CI: 1.58-2.05), 30-day readmission (1.39, 95% CI: 1.19-1.62, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (2.42, 95% CI: 1.74-3.38, p < 0.001).

      "# Title: Genome-wide survey reveals predisposing diabetes type 2-related DNA methylation variations in human peripheral blood.\n# Abstract: Inter-individual DNA methylation variations were frequently hypothesized to alter individual susceptibility to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Sequence-influenced methylations were described in T2DM-associated genomic regions, but evidence for direct, sequence-independent association with disease risk is missing. Here, we explore disease-contributing DNA methylation through a stepwise study design: first, a pool-based, genome-scale screen among 1169 case and control individuals revealed an excess of differentially methylated sites in genomic regions that were previously associated with T2DM through genetic studies. Next, in-depth analyses were performed at selected top-ranking regions. A CpG site in the first intron of the FTO gene showed small (3.35%) but significant (P = 0.000021) hypomethylation of cases relative to controls. The effect was independent of the sequence polymorphism in the region and persists among individuals carrying the sequence-risk alleles. The odds of belonging to the T2DM group increased by 6.1% for every 1% decrease in methylation (OR = 1.061, 95% CI: 1.032-1.090), the odds ratio for decrease of 1 standard deviation of methylation (adjusted to gender) was 1.5856 (95% CI: 1.2824-1.9606) and the sensitivity (area under the curve = 0.638, 95% CI: 0.586-0.690; males = 0.675, females = 0.609) was better than that of the strongest known sequence variant. Furthermore, a prospective study in an independent population cohort revealed significant hypomethylation of young individuals that later progressed to T2DM, relative to the individuals who stayed healthy. Further genomic analysis revealed co-localization with gene enhancers and with binding sites for methylation-sensitive transcriptional regulators. The data showed that low methylation level at the analyzed sites is an early marker of T2DM and suggests a novel mechanism by which early-onset, inter-individual methylation variation at isolated non-promoter genomic sites predisposes to T2DM.",
      "# Title: DNA methylation profiling identifies epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetic patients.\n# Abstract: In addition to genetic predisposition, environmental and lifestyle factors contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Epigenetic changes may provide the link for translating environmental exposures into pathological mechanisms. In this study, we performed the first comprehensive DNA methylation profiling in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We uncovered 276 CpG loci affiliated to promoters of 254 genes displaying significant differential DNA methylation in diabetic islets. These methylation changes were not present in blood cells from T2D individuals nor were they experimentally induced in non-diabetic islets by exposure to high glucose. For a subgroup of the differentially methylated genes, concordant transcriptional changes were present. Functional annotation of the aberrantly methylated genes and RNAi experiments highlighted pathways implicated in β-cell survival and function; some are implicated in cellular dysfunction while others facilitate adaptation to stressors. Together, our findings offer new insights into the intricate mechanisms of T2D pathogenesis, underscore the important involvement of epigenetic dysregulation in diabetic islets and may advance our understanding of T2D aetiology.",

      "# Title: Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of human pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic donors identifies candidate genes that influence insulin secretion.\n# Abstract: Impaired insulin secretion is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Epigenetics may affect disease susceptibility. To describe the human methylome in pancreatic islets and determine the epigenetic basis of T2D, we analyzed DNA methylation of 479,927 CpG sites and the transcriptome in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We provide a detailed map of the global DNA methylation pattern in human islets, β- and α-cells. Genomic regions close to the transcription start site showed low degrees of methylation and regions further away from the transcription start site such as the gene body, 3'UTR and intergenic regions showed a higher degree of methylation. While CpG islands were hypomethylated, the surrounding 2 kb shores showed an intermediate degree of methylation, whereas regions further away (shelves and open sea) were hypermethylated in human islets, β- and α-cells. We identified 1,649 CpG sites and 853 genes, including TCF7L2, FTO and KCNQ1, with differential DNA methylation in T2D islets after correction for multiple testing. The majority of the differentially methylated CpG sites had an intermediate degree of methylation and were underrepresented in CpG islands (∼ 7%) and overrepresented in the open sea (∼ 60%). 102 of the differentially methylated genes, including CDKN1A, PDE7B, SEPT9 and EXOC3L2, were differentially expressed in T2D islets. Methylation of CDKN1A and PDE7B promoters in vitro suppressed their transcriptional activity. Functional analyses demonstrated that identified candidate genes affect pancreatic β- and α-cells as Exoc3l silencing reduced exocytosis and overexpression of Cdkn1a, Pde7b and Sept9 perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion in clonal β- and α-cells, respectively. Together, our data can serve as a reference methylome in human islets. We provide new target genes with altered DNA methylation and expression in human T2D islets that contribute to perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion. These results highlight the importance of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of T2D.",
      "# Title: Altered DNA methylation and differential expression of genes influencing metabolism and inflammation in adipose tissue from subjects with type 2 diabetes.\n# Abstract: Genetics, epigenetics, and environment may together affect the susceptibility for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our aim was to dissect molecular mechanisms underlying T2D using genome-wide expression and DNA methylation data in adipose tissue from monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D and independent case-control cohorts. In adipose tissue from diabetic twins, we found decreased expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation; carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism; and increased expression of genes involved in inflammation and glycan degradation. The most differentially expressed genes included ELOVL6, GYS2, FADS1, SPP1 (OPN), CCL18, and IL1RN. We replicated these results in adipose tissue from an independent case-control cohort. Several candidate genes for obesity and T2D (e.g., IRS1 and VEGFA) were differentially expressed in discordant twins. We found a heritable contribution to the genome-wide DNA methylation variability in twins. Differences in methylation between monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D were subsequently modest. However, 15,627 sites, representing 7,046 genes including PPARG, KCNQ1, TCF7L2, and IRS1, showed differential DNA methylation in adipose tissue from unrelated subjects with T2D compared with control subjects. A total of 1,410 of these sites also showed differential DNA methylation in the twins discordant for T2D. For the differentially methylated sites, the heritability estimate was 0.28. We also identified copy number variants (CNVs) in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D. Taken together, subjects with T2D exhibit multiple transcriptional and epigenetic changes in adipose tissue relevant to the development of the disease.",
      "# Title: An integrated epigenomic analysis for type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci in monozygotic twins.\n# Abstract: DNA methylation has a great potential for understanding the aetiology of common complex traits such as Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here we perform genome-wide methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) in whole-blood-derived DNA from 27 monozygotic twin pairs and follow up results with replication and integrated omics analyses. We identify predominately hypermethylated T2D-related differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and replicate the top signals in 42 unrelated T2D cases and 221 controls. The strongest signal is in the promoter of the MALT1 gene, involved in insulin and glycaemic pathways, and related to taurocholate levels in blood. Integrating the DNA methylome findings with T2D GWAS meta-analysis results reveals a strong enrichment for DMRs in T2D-susceptibility loci. We also detect signals specific to T2D-discordant twins in the GPR61 and PRKCB genes. These replicated T2D associations reflect both likely causal and consequential pathways of the disease. The analysis indicates how an integrated genomics and epigenomics approach, utilizing an MZ twin design, can provide pathogenic insights as well as potential drug targets and biomarkers for T2D and other complex traits.",

In the setting of large, extended families representing a minority, high-risk population of the USA, we aimed to characterize the role of epigenome-wide DNA methylation in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Using Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays, we tested for association of DNA methylation at 446 356 sites with age, sex and phenotypic traits related to T2D in 850 pedigreed Mexican-American individuals. Robust statistical analyses showed that (i) 15% of the methylome is significantly heritable, with a median heritability of 0.14; (ii) DNA methylation at 14% of CpG sites is associated with nearby sequence variants; (iii) 22% and 3% of the autosomal CpG sites are associated with age and sex, respectively; (iv) 53 CpG sites were significantly associated with liability to T2D, fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance; (v) DNA methylation levels at five CpG sites, mapping to three well-characterized genes (TXNIP, ABCG1 and SAMD12) independently explained 7.8% of the heritability of T2D (vi) methylation at these five sites was unlikely to be influenced by neighboring DNA sequence variation. Our study has identified novel epigenetic indicators of T2D risk in Mexican Americans who have increased risk for this disease. These results provide new insights into potential treatment targets of T2D.",

      "# Title: Epigenome-wide association study identifies TXNIP gene associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and sustained hyperglycemia.\n# Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is an established risk factor for a wide range of vascular diseases, including ischemic stroke (IS). Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a marker for average blood glucose levels over the previous 12 weeks, is used as a measure of glycemic control and also as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes (HbA1c levels ≥ 6.5%). Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, may be associated with aging processes and with modulation of the risk of various pathologies, such as DM. Specifically, DNA methylation could be one of the mechanisms mediating the relation between DM and environmental exposures. Our goal was to identify new CpG methylation sites associated with DM. We performed a genome-wide methylation study in whole-blood DNA from an IS patient cohorts. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array was used to measure DNA methylation in CpG sites. All statistical analyses were adjusted for sex, age, hyperlipidemia, body mass index (BMI), smoking habit and cell count. Findings were replicated in two independent cohorts, an IS cohort and a population-based cohort, using the same array. In the discovery phase (N = 355), we identified a CpG site, cg19693031 (located in the TXNIP gene) that was associated with DM (P = 1.17 × 10(-12)); this CpG was replicated in two independent cohorts (N = 167 and N = 645). Methylation of TXNIP was inversely and intensely associated with HbA1c levels (P = 7.3 × 10(-16)), specifically related to diabetic patients with poor control of glucose levels. We identified an association between the TXNIP gene and DM through epigenetic mechanisms, related to sustained hyperglycemia levels (HbA1c ≥ 7%).",

Here we examine whether age-related epigenetic changes affect human islet function and if blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect these changes and associate with future T2D. We analyse DNA methylation genome-wide in islets from 87 non-diabetic donors, aged 26-74 years. Aging associates with increased DNA methylation of 241 sites. These sites cover loci previously associated with T2D, for example, KLF14. Blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related methylation changes in 83 genes identified in human islets (for example, KLF14, FHL2, ZNF518B and FAM123C) and some associate with insulin secretion and T2D. DNA methylation correlates with islet expression of multiple genes, including FHL2, ZNF518B, GNPNAT1 and HLTF. Silencing these genes in β-cells alter insulin secretion. Together, we demonstrate that blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related DNA methylation changes in human islets, and associate with insulin secretion in vivo and T2D.",

To conduct a genome-wide DNA methylation in individuals with type 2 diabetes, individuals with prediabetes, and control mixed ancestry individuals from South Africa. Methods. We used peripheral blood to perform genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in 3 individuals with screen detected diabetes, 3 individuals with prediabetes, and 3 individuals with normoglycaemia from the Bellville South Community, Cape Town, South Africa, who were age-, gender-, body mass index-, and duration of residency-matched. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) was performed by Arraystar Inc. (Rockville, MD, USA). Results. Hypermethylated DMRs were 1160 (81.97%) and 124 (43.20%), respectively, in individuals with diabetes and prediabetes when both were compared to subjects with normoglycaemia. Our data shows that genes related to the immune system, signal transduction, glucose transport, and pancreas development have altered DNA methylation in subjects with prediabetes and diabetes. Pathway analysis based on the functional analysis mapping of genes to KEGG pathways suggested that the linoleic acid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism pathways are hypomethylated in prediabetes and diabetes. Conclusions. Our study suggests that epigenetic changes are likely to be an early process that occurs before the onset of overt diabetes. Detailed analysis of DMRs that shows gradual methylation differences from control versus prediabetes to prediabetes versus diabetes in a larger sample size is required to confirm these findings.",

Only a few studies have investigated DNA methylation of selected candidate genes or a very small fraction of genomic CpG sites in human pancreatic islets, the tissue of primary pathogenic importance for diabetes. Our aim was to characterize the whole-genome DNA methylation landscape in human pancreatic islets, to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in diabetic islets, and to investigate the function of DMRs in islet biology. Here, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, which is a comprehensive and unbiased method to study DNA methylation throughout the genome at a single nucleotide resolution, in pancreatic islets from donors with T2D and control subjects without diabetes. We identified 25,820 DMRs in islets from individuals with T2D. These DMRs cover loci with known islet function, e.g., PDX1, TCF7L2, and ADCY5 Importantly, binding sites previously identified by ChIP-seq for islet-specific transcription factors, enhancer regions, and different histone marks were enriched in the T2D-associated DMRs. We also identified 457 genes, including NR4A3, PARK2, PID1, SLC2A2, and SOCS2, that had both DMRs and significant expression changes in T2D islets. To mimic the situation in T2D islets, candidate genes were overexpressed or silenced in cultured β-cells. This resulted in impaired insulin secretion, thereby connecting differential methylation to islet dysfunction. We further explored the islet methylome and found a strong link between methylation levels and histone marks. Additionally, DNA methylation in different genomic regions and of different transcript types (i.e., protein coding, noncoding, and pseudogenes) was associated with islet expression levels. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the islet DNA methylome in individuals with and without diabetes and highlights the importance of epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets and T2D pathogenesis."

    "referenceConclusion": "Pre-conditioning significantly reduced the severity of creatine kinase release, delayed-onset muscle soreness, loss of maximal voluntary contraction force and the range of motion decrease. Pre-conditioning may prevent severe EIMD and accelerate recovery of muscle force generation capacity. The current systematic review identified that pre-conditioning activities are effective in attenuating EIMD measures, CK, muscle soreness, ROM and maximal voluntary force production. These findings suggest the use of pre-conditioning activities prior to a strenuous bout of exercise does provide a significant protective effect when performed a minimum of 24 h prior to the damaging stimulus. Furthermore, the greater improvement in MVC suggests that the pre-conditioning activities may accelerate the recovery of muscle contractile properties following strenuous exercises. However, it is unclear if pre-conditioning would prevent EIMD from more complex exercises or to what extent EIMD prevention carries over into other modes of exercise.",

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a prior bout of maximal isokinetic eccentric exercise on DOMS, strength loss and plasma creatine kinase (CK) changes following a downhill run. Ten male subjects with a mean (+/- S.D.) age of 22.5 +/- 2.8 years, body mass of 62.67 +/- 0.05 kg and height of 176 +/- 3 cm were allocated to either a treatment group or a control group. The treatment group performed 100 maximal eccentric activations of the knee extensors in the dominant leg at 0.52 rad s-1. Two weeks later, the downhill run was performed on a motor-driven treadmill. This consisted of five bouts of 8 min at a gradient of -10% at a speed corresponding to 80% of the predicted maximal heart rate. The untrained group performed the downhill run as above but without the prior isokinetic session. Tenderness measurements, plasma CK activity and concentric and eccentric isokinetic peak torque measurements of the knee extensors at 0.52 and 2.83 rad s-1 were recorded prior to, immediately following and 2, 4 and 7 days after each protocol. The isokinetic protocol caused an increase (P < 0.01) in CK and tenderness and a decrease (P < 0.05) in concentric and eccentric torque at both speeds in the treatment group. Following the downhill run, a reduction in peak torque (P < 0.01) was observed in the eccentric and concentric modes at both isokinetic speeds in the control group. For the treatment group, the decrease in peak torque occurred only at the faster eccentric speed. With the exception of the faster eccentric speed, the decrement in peak torque was greater in the control group in all post-exercise isokinetic strength tests. There was less tenderness (P < 0.01) in the trained knee extensor muscle group. Peak torque also returned to pre-downhill values earlier for the trained group. Although plasma CK activity increased in both groups after downhill running, it was much lower (P < 0.01) in the trained group. The results suggest that a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric training reduces muscle damage, reduces the amount of strength loss and decreases the sensation of DOMS after downhill running.",
      "# Title: Exercise-induced skeletal muscle damage and adaptation following repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions.\n# Abstract: Repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions were used to examine indirect indices of exercise-induced muscle damage and adaptation in human skeletal muscle. Twenty-four subjects (18 females, 6 males) aged 20.0 +/- 1.4 years (mean +/- S.D.) performed an initial bout of either 10 (n = 7), 30 (n = 9) or 50 (n = 8) maximum voluntary eccentric contractions of the knee extensors, followed by a second bout of 50 contractions 3 weeks later using the same leg. Muscle soreness was elevated after all bouts (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon test), although the initial bout reduced the soreness associated with the second bout. Force loss and a decline in the 20:100 Hz percutaneous electrical myostimulation force ratio were observed after all exercise bouts (P < 0.01). Serum creatine kinase activity was elevated following the initial bouts of 30 and 50 repetitions (P < 0.01), but there was no increase following 10 repetitions. No increase in serum creatine kinase activity was observed in any group following the second bout of contractions (P > 0.05). We conclude that skeletal muscle adaptation can be brought about by a single bout of relatively few eccentric muscle contractions. Increasing the number of eccentric muscle repetitions did not result in an increased prophylactic effect on skeletal muscle.",
      "# Title: Influence of previous concentric exercise on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether a fatiguing concentric exercise performed immediately before eccentric exercise would exacerbate eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. One arm of nine female subjects (mean +/- s: 23.3 +/- 6.7 years) performed 12 maximal eccentric actions of the elbow flexors (ECC), and the other arm performed 100 repetitions of isokinetic concentric actions of the elbow flexors followed by the same eccentric exercise (CON-ECC). The two exercise regimens (ECC and CON-ECC) were separated by 2 weeks and presented in a counterbalanced order. Changes in muscle soreness level, maximal isometric force generation, relaxed and flexed elbow joint angle, upper arm circumference and plasma creatine kinase activity were compared between the ECC and CON-ECC conditions. All measures changed significantly after both ECC and CON-ECC; however, there were significant differences in the changes between the conditions. A lower level of soreness, a faster recovery of maximal isometric force generation, a smaller decrease in relaxed elbow joint angle and a smaller increase in upper arm circumference and creatine kinase activity were evident after the CON-ECC condition compared to the ECC condition. Thus, it would seem that muscle damage was attenuated by performance of previous concentric exercise. An additional experiment using a different group of subjects (n = 5) showed that warm-up exercise before the eccentric exercise also attenuated eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Acute adaptation to low volume eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: Many symptoms of eccentric muscle damage can be substantially reduced if a similar eccentric bout is repeated within several weeks of the initial bout. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a nondamaging, low repetition, low volume eccentric exercise bout could also provide a protective/adaptive effect.",
      "# Title: The repeated bout effect of reduced-load eccentric exercise on elbow flexor muscle damage.\n# Abstract: In this study we investigated the extent to which an initial eccentric exercise consisting of two (2ECC) or six maximal eccentric actions (6ECC) of the elbow flexors would produce a similar effect to 24 maximal eccentric actions (24ECC), on a second bout of 24ECC performed 2 weeks later. Male students (n = 34) were assigned to one of three groups, and with their non-dominant arm performed either 2ECC (n = 12), 6ECC (n = 10), or 24ECC (n = 12) as a first bout of exercise. Two weeks later all groups performed 24ECC. Maximal isometric strength, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration were assessed before, immediately after, and for 4 days after exercise. Changes in all variables were compared between the bouts and groups by a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance. All variables changed significantly (P< 0.05) after 2ECC, 6ECC, and 24ECC, but the amount of change after 2ECC and 6ECC was significantly smaller (P<0.05) than both 6ECC and 24ECC, and 24ECC, respectively. After the second bout, the 6ECC and 24ECC groups showed a profound repeated bout effect, and no significant differences were found between the groups. All variables except muscle soreness were significantly (P< 0.05) larger after the second bout for the 2ECC group, however the changes observed after 24ECC were significantly smaller (P < 0.01) than those observed after the first 24ECC of the 24ECC group. These results suggest that it is not necessary to conduct a high number of eccentric actions in the first bout to elicit a repeated bout effect in a subsequent bout performed some time later.",
      "# Title: Partial protection against muscle damage by eccentric actions at short muscle lengths.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that maximal eccentric actions at a short muscle length would fail to confer a protective effect against muscle damage induced by maximal eccentric exercise at a long muscle length.",
      "# Title: Intensity of eccentric exercise, shift of optimum angle, and the magnitude of repeated-bout effect.\n# Abstract: This study compared the effect of four different intensities of initial eccentric exercise (ECC1) on optimum angle shift and extent of muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise. Fifty-two male students were placed into 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% groups (n = 13 per group), performing 30 eccentric actions of the elbow flexors of 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% of maximal isometric strength [maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)] for ECC1, followed 2-3 wk later by a similar exercise (ECC2) that used 100% MVC load. MVC at six elbow joint angles, range of motion, upper arm circumference, serum creatine kinase activity, myoglobin concentration, and muscle soreness were measured before and for 5 days following ECC1 and ECC2. A rightward shift of optimum angle following ECC1 was significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 100% and 80% than for the 60% and 40% groups, and it decreased significantly (P < 0.05) from immediately to 5 days postexercise. By the time ECC2 was performed, only the 100% group kept a significant shift (4 degrees). Changes in most of the criterion measures following ECC1 were significantly greater for the 100% and 80% groups compared with the 60% and 40% groups. Changes in the criterion measures following ECC2 were significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 40% group compared with other groups. Although the magnitude of repeated bout effect following ECC2 was significantly (P < 0.05) smaller for the 40% and 60% groups, all groups showed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced changes in criterion measures following ECC2 compared with the ECC1 100% bout. We conclude that the repeated-bout effect was not dependent on the shift of optimum angle.",
      "# Title: Repeated bout effect after maximal eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: We hypothesized that a bout of high or low volume eccentric exercise would protect against muscle damage following a subsequent high volume bout and that adaptation would be attributable to neural changes, independent of the initial exercise volume. Sixteen males performed either 45 (ECC45) or 10 (ECC10) maximal eccentric contractions using the elbow flexors, followed by an ECC45 bout 2 weeks later. Damage markers were measured for the following 96 h; EMG and work done during the first 10 eccentric contractions were also recorded. CK, soreness, and decrements in MVC and range of motion (ROM) were greater in bout 1 than bout 2 (p < 0.01). Soreness, MVC and ROM were greater after the initial ECC45 bout compared to the initial ECC10 bout and the repeated bouts of ECC45 exercise in both groups (p < 0.01). Median frequency decreased from bout 1 to bout 2 (p < 0.001), no differences between groups were observed. An ECC45 bout of maximal eccentric exercise causes more initial damage than an ECC10 bout of maximal eccentric exercise, although both confer protection from subsequent ECC45 bouts of maximal eccentric contractions, which are attributable, at least in part, to a shift in the frequency content of EMG.",
      "# Title: A light load eccentric exercise confers protection against a subsequent bout of more demanding eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that a light eccentric exercise (ECC) that does not induce a loss of muscle function and delayed onset muscle soreness would confer a protective effect against a more strenuous ECC. Eighteen young men were randomly placed into two groups: 10-40% (n=9) and 40% (n=9). Subjects in the 10-40% group performed ECC of the elbow flexors (six sets of five reps) using a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (MVC) at an elbow joint angle of 90 degrees , followed 2 days later by ECC using a dumbbell weight of 40% MVC. Subjects in the 40% group performed the 40% ECC only. Changes in MVC, range of motion (ROM), upper arm circumference (CIR), plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and muscle soreness before, immediately after, 1-5 and 7 days following the 40% ECC were compared between groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any of the criterion measures were found immediately and 1-2 days after the 10% ECC. Following the 40% ECC, the 10-40% group showed significantly (P<0.05) smaller decreases in MVC and ROM, and smaller increases in muscle soreness compared with the 40% group, but no significant differences between groups were evident for CIR and plasma CK activity. These results suggest that the 10% ECC induced some protection against a subsequent bout of 40% ECC performed 2 days later. It appears that the light eccentric exercise preconditioned the muscles for exposure to the subsequent damaging eccentric exercise bout.",
      "# Title: Protection against muscle damage following fifty drop jumps conferred by ten drop jumps.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether 10 drop jumps (DJs) would confer protective effect against muscle damage and soreness in a subsequent bout of 50 DJs. Sixteen men were randomly placed into either a group performing 1 set of 10 DJs followed by 5 sets of 10 DJs (10-50, n = 8) or another group performing 2 bouts of 5 sets of 10 DJs (50-50, n = 8) separated by 2 weeks. The DJs were performed from a box height of 0.6 m, with a 10-second interval between jumps and a 1-minute rest between sets. Jump height, peak vertical ground reaction force, ground contact time, and heart rate during DJs were measured, and blood lactate concentration was assessed before and immediately after DJs. Changes in maximal isometric (ISO) and isokinetic concentric torque (CON), vertical jump, muscle soreness, and plasma creatine kinase activity before, immediately after, and at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours following exercise were compared between groups for the first and second bouts and between the bouts by a 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance. Changes in ISO, CON, vertical jump, and muscle soreness were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller for 10 DJs compared with 50 DJs; however, no significant differences in the measures between groups were evident following the second bout. The changes in the measures following 50 DJs in the 10-50 group were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller than those following the first bout of the 50-50 group. These results suggest that 10 DJs and 50 DJs conferred the same magnitude of protective effect against muscle damage by 50 DJs.",
      "# Title: Muscle damage protection by low-intensity eccentric contractions remains for 2 weeks but not 3 weeks.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that the protective effect conferred by a low-intensity eccentric exercise against maximal eccentric exercise would not last more than a week. Untrained men (21.3 ± 1.6 years) were allocated into either a control or one of four repeated bout groups (n = 13 per group). The repeated bout groups performed 30 low-intensity eccentric contractions (ECC) of the elbow flexors with a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (10%-ECC) either 2 days, 7 days (1 week), 14 days (2 weeks) or 21 days (3 weeks) before 30 maximal eccentric contractions (Max-ECC). The control group performed Max-ECC only. Changes in maximal voluntary contraction strength, optimum angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following 10%-ECC were analysed by a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Changes in the variables following Max-ECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. The 10%-ECC did not change any variables, showing no indication of muscle damage. The changes in all variables following Max-ECC were smaller (P < 0.05) for 2-day, 1- and 2-week groups than control group, without significant differences between 2-day and 1-week groups. The 2-week group showed greater (P < 0.05) changes in all variables compared with 2-day and 1-week groups. Changes in the variables were similar between 3-week and control groups, except for muscle soreness showing smaller (P < 0.05) changes for 3-week group. These results suggest that non-damaging eccentric exercise confers a protective effect against Max-Ecc, but the effect is attenuated between 1 and 2 weeks.",
      "# Title: Two maximal isometric contractions attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVC-ISO) would attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. Young untrained men were placed into one of the two experimental groups or one control group (n = 13 per group). Subjects in the experimental groups performed either two or 10 MVC-ISO of the elbow flexors at a long muscle length (20° flexion) 2 days prior to 30 maximal isokinetic eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors. Subjects in the control group performed the eccentric contractions without MVC-ISO. No significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction peak torque, peak torque angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and myoglobin concentration, muscle soreness, and ultrasound echo intensity were evident after MVC-ISO. Changes in the variables following eccentric contractions were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2 MVC-ISO group (e.g., peak torque loss at 5 days after exercise, 23% ± 3%; peak CK activity, 1964 ± 452 IU·L(-1); peak muscle soreness, 46 ± 4 mm) or the 10 MVC-ISO group (13% ± 3%, 877 ± 198 IU·L(-1), 30 ± 4 mm) compared with the control (34% ± 4%, 6192 ± 1747 IU·L(-1), 66 ± 5 mm). The 10 MVC-ISO group showed smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following eccentric contractions compared with the 2 MVC-ISO group. Therefore, two MVC-ISO conferred potent protective effects against muscle damage, whereas greater protective effect was induced by 10 MVC-ISO, which can be used as a strategy to minimize muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Attenuation of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage by preconditioning exercises.\n# Abstract: This study compared the effect of an initial exercise consisting of either low-intensity eccentric or maximal isometric contractions (ISOs) on protective effect against maximal eccentric contraction (MaxECC)-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions attenuate muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise of the knee extensors in the elderly.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors would attenuate the magnitude of muscle damage induced by maximal eccentric exercise of the same muscle performed 7 days later using elderly individuals. Healthy older men (66.4 ± 4.6 years) were assigned to control or experimental (Exp) group (n = 13 per group). The control group performed six sets of ten maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC) of the knee extensors of non-dominant leg. The Exp group performed six sets of ten low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors on a leg extension machine by lowering a weight of 10 % maximal voluntary isometric knee extension strength (10 %ECC) 7 days prior to MaxECC. Changes in maximal voluntary isokinetic concentric torque (MVC-CON), angle at peak torque, range of motion (ROM), upper thigh circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin (Mb) concentration and B-mode ultrasound echo-intensity before and for 5 days after MaxECC were compared between groups by a mixed factor ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were observed following 10 %ECC. Following MaxECC, all variables changed significantly, and changes in all variables except for angle at peak torque were significantly different between groups. MVC-CON and ROM decreased smaller and recovered faster (P < 0.05) for Exp than control group, and changes in other variables were smaller (P < 0.05) for Exp group compared with control group. These results suggest that preconditioning knee extensor muscles with low-intensity eccentric contractions was effective for attenuating muscle damage induced by subsequent MaxECC of the knee extensors for elderly individuals.",
      "# Title: Effect of two maximal isometric contractions on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the elbow flexors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the time wise protective effect conferred by two maximal voluntary isometric contractions (2MVCs) at 20° elbow flexion on muscle damage induced by 30 maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors (MaxECC). Sixty-five young untrained men were randomly assigned to a control group that did not perform 2MVCs, or one of four experimental groups (n = 13 per group) who performed 2MVCs either immediately (0d), 2 (2d), 4 (4d) or 7 days (7d) before MaxECC. Changes in maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) concentric torque (MVC-CON), optimum angle (OA), range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following MaxECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were evident following 2MVCs. The 2d and 4d groups showed 16-62 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following MaxECC than the control, 0d and 7d groups. The 2d group showed 14-34 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables except for OA compared with the 4d group. The changes in the variables were similar among the control, 0d and 7d groups. These results show that 2MVCs that were performed between 2 and 4 days before MaxECC attenuated the magnitude of muscle damage, but no such effect was evident if the 2MVCs were performed immediately or 7 days before MaxECC. It is concluded that the protective effect conferred by 2MVCs is relatively short-lived, and there is a window for the effect to be conferred.",
      "# Title: Effect of a prior bout of preconditioning exercise on muscle damage from downhill walking.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether reduced-duration downhill walking (DW) would confer a protective effect against muscle damage induced by a subsequent bout of longer duration DW performed 1 week or 4 weeks later. Healthy young adults were allocated to a control or one of the preconditioning exercise (PRE-1wk or PRE-4wk) groups (10 men and 4 women per group). PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups performed 20-min DW (-28% slope, 5 km/h, 10% body mass added to a backpack) 1 week and 4 weeks before 40-min DW, respectively, and the control group performed 40-min DW only. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) knee extension torque, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity, and muscle soreness (100-mm visual analog scale) were measured before, immediately after, and 24, 48, and 72 h after DW, and the changes in these variables were compared among groups. The control group showed symptoms of muscle damage (e.g., prolonged decrease in MVC: -14% ± 10% at 48 h post-DW) after 40-min DW. Changes in all variables after 40-min DW of PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups were 54%-61% smaller (P < 0.05) than the control group, without significant differences between PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups for MVC and plasma CK activity. Importantly, changes after the preconditioning exercise (20-min DW) were 67%-69% smaller (P < 0.05) than those after the 40-min DW of the control group. These findings suggest that 20-min DW resulting in minor muscle damage conferred a protective effect against subsequent 40-min DW, and its effect could last for more than 4 weeks.",

      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors and flexors protect against muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the magnitude and duration of the protective effect of low-intensity eccentric contractions (LowEC) against damage induced by maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) of the knee flexors (KF) and extensors (KE). Young men were assigned to 8 experimental groups and 2 control groups (n = 13/group); the experimental groups performed LowEC of KF or KE 2 days (2d), 1 week (1wk), 2 weeks (2wk), or 3 weeks (3wk) before MaxEC, while the control groups performed MaxEC of KF or KE without LowEC. The 2d, 1wk, 2wk, and 3wk groups performed 30 LowEC of KF or 60 LowEC of KE with a load of 10% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction strength on a resistance-training machine, and all groups performed 30 MaxEC of KF or 60 MaxEC of KE on an isokinetic dynamometer. Several muscle damage markers were measured from before to 2 days after exercise (LowEC) or from before to 5 days after exercise (MaxEC). No significant changes in any variables were evident after LowEC. The changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2d and 1wk groups (e.g., peak creatine kinase activity: 1002 ± 501 IU/L; peak muscle soreness: 13 ± 5 mm) than for the control group (peak creatine kinase activity: 3005 ± 983 IU/L; peak muscle soreness 28 ± 6 mm) for both KE and KF. There were no significant differences between the 2d and 1wk groups or among the 2wk, 3wk, and control groups. These results show that LowEC provided 30%-66% protection against damage induced by MaxEC of KF and KE, and the protective effect lasted 1 week.",
      "# Title: Protective effect by maximal isometric contractions against maximal eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the knee extensors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) performed before maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) would attenuate muscle damage of the knee extensors. Untrained men were placed to an experimental group that performed 6 sets of 10 MVIC at 90° knee flexion 2 weeks before 6 sets of 10 MaxEC or a control group that performed MaxEC only (n = 13/group). Changes in muscle damage markers were assessed before to 5 days after each exercise. Small but significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction torque, range of motion (ROM) and plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity were evident at immediately to 2 days post-MVIC (p < 0.05), but other variables (e.g. thigh girth, myoglobin concentration, B-mode echo intensity) did not change significantly. Changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (p < 0.05) by 45% (soreness)-67% (CK) for the experimental than the control group. These results suggest that MVIC conferred potent protective effect against MaxEC-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Prevention of downhill walking-induced muscle damage by non-damaging downhill walking.\n# Abstract: Mountain trekking involves level, uphill, and downhill walking (DW). Prolonged DW induces damage to leg muscles, reducing force generating ability and muscle coordination. These increase risks for more serious injuries and accidents in mountain trekking, thus a strategy to minimize muscle damage is warranted. It has been shown that low-intensity eccentric contractions confer protective effect on muscle damage induced by high-intensity eccentric contractions. This study tested the hypothesis that 5-min non-damaging DW would attenuate muscle damage induced by 40-min DW, but 5-min level walking (LW) would not.",
      "# Title: Isometric pre-conditioning blunts exercise-induced muscle damage but does not attenuate changes in running economy following downhill running.\n# Abstract: Running economy (RE) is impaired following unaccustomed eccentric-biased exercises that induce muscle damage. It is also known that muscle damage is reduced when maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) are performed at a long muscle length 2-4 days prior to maximal eccentric exercise with the same muscle, a phenomenon that can be described as isometric pre-conditioning (IPC). We tested the hypothesis that IPC could attenuate muscle damage and changes in RE following downhill running. Thirty untrained men were randomly assigned into experimental or control groups and ran downhill on a treadmill (-15%) for 30 min. Participants in the experimental group completed 10 MVIC in a leg press machine two days prior to downhill running, while participants in the control group did not perform IPC. The magnitude of changes in muscle soreness determined 48 h after downhill running was greater for the control group (122 ± 28 mm) than for the experimental group (92 ± 38 mm). Isometric peak torque recovered faster in the experimental group compared with the control group (3 days vs. no full recovery, respectively). No significant effect of IPC was found for countermovement jump height, serum creatine kinase activity or any parameters associated with RE. These results supported the hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in markers of muscle damage. The hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in RE was not supported by our data. It appears that the mechanisms involved in changes in markers of muscle damage and parameters associated with RE following downhill running are not completely shared.",

However, it is not known whether this strategy could be applied to other muscles. This study investigated whether 10% EC would confer damage protective effect on high-intensity eccentric contractions (80% EC) for nine different muscle groups.",
      "# Title: Protective Effect Conferred by Isometric Preconditioning Against Slow- and Fast-Velocity Eccentric Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage.\n# Abstract: We investigated if the same isometric preconditioning protocol (IPP) attenuates the magnitude of muscle damage induced by different maximal eccentric exercise protocols in the elbow flexors. Sixty-four untrained men were assigned to either two experimental or two control groups. Participants in the experimental groups performed an IPP prior to either slow (60°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-S) or fast (180°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-F) maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC). Subjects in the control groups performed slow (ECC-S) or fast (ECC-F) MaxECC without IPP. Maximal isokinetic concentric torque (MVC), muscle soreness (SOR), and muscle thickness (MT) were assessed before, immediately after, and 1-4 days following the MaxECC. Significant (p < 0.05) group vs. time interactions were found for MVC (F = 4,517), SOR (F = 6,318), and MT (F = 1,863). The ECC-S group presented faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and MT and less (p < 0.05) SOR at 96 h post-MaxECC compared with ECC-F group. No significant differences in MVC and MT were found between ECC-S and ECC-F groups following MaxECC. The ISO + ECC-S group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and SOR compared to the ECC-S group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ECC-S in any variable. The ISO + ECC-F group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of all assessed variables compared with the ECC-F group. MVC was greater (p < 0.05) at 48-72 h, and SOR was less (p < 0.05) at 48-96 h in the ISO + ECC-F compared to the ECC-F group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ISO + ECC-F for any variable. These results show that the IPP accelerated recovery of MVC and SOR for the slow-eccentric exercise condition and attenuated strength loss and SOR in addition to faster recovery of all assessed variables for the fast-eccentric exercise condition. Therefore, the IPP can be used as a strategy to attenuate and accelerate recovery of muscle damage induced by different-velocity eccentric exercises, resulting in greater protection against muscle damage induced by faster velocity."

      "# Title: Expression of a hepatitis A virus antigen in Lactococcus lactis and Escherichia coli and evaluation of its immunogenicity.\n# Abstract: An epidemic shift in Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection has been observed in recent years in rapidly developing countries, with increasing numbers of severe adult cases which has led to renewed interest in vaccination. Our approach in vaccine development uses recombinant expression of the highly immunogenic HAV antigen VP1-P2a in food-grade lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis and in Escherichia coli. We used genetic constructs that enable nisin-controlled expression of the antigen in L. lactis in three different forms: (a) intracellularly, (b) on the bacterial surface and (c) on the bacterial surface fused with the fragment of the E. coli flagellin molecule that can act as a molecular adjuvant. Expression of the two surface forms of the antigen was achieved in L. lactis, and the resulting antigen-displaying bacteria were administered orally to mice. Half the animals in each of the two groups developed specific IgGs, with titers increasing over time and reaching 1:422 without flagellin and 1:320 with flagellin. A much higher titer 1:25,803 was observed with the parenterally administered antigen, which was purified from E. coli. With the latter, a significant mucosal IgA response was also observed. Despite significant titers, the IgGs elicited with oral or parenteral administration could not prevent HAV from infecting cells in a virus neutralization assay, suggesting that the antibodies cannot recognize viral surface epitopes. Nevertheless, orally administered HAV antigen expressed in L. lactis elicited significant systemic humoral immune response showing the feasibility for development of effective HAV vaccine for mucosal delivery.",
      "# Title: Oral immunization with recombinant Lactococcus lactis delivering a multi-epitope antigen CTB-UE attenuates Helicobacter pylori infection in mice.\n# Abstract: Urease is an essential virulence factor and colonization factor for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and is considered as an excellent vaccine candidate antigen. However, conventional technologies for preparing an injectable vaccine require purification of the antigenic protein and preparation of an adjuvant. Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 (L. lactis) could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of edible vaccine. In previous study, we constructed a multi-epitope vaccine, designated CTB-UE, which is composed of the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), three Th cell epitopes and two B-cell epitopes from urease subunits. To develop a novel type of oral vaccine against H. pylori, genetically modified L. lactis strains were established to secrete this epitope vaccine extracellularly in this study. Oral prophylactic immunization with recombinant L. lactis significantly elicited humoral anti-urease antibody responses (P < 0.001) and reduced the gastric colonization of H. pylori from 7.14 ± 0.95 to 4.68 ± 0.98 log10 CFU g(-1) stomach. This L. lactis oral vaccine offers a promising vaccine candidate for the control of H. pylori infection.",
      "# Title: Development of a new DNA vaccine based on mycobacterial ESAT-6 antigen delivered by recombinant invasive Lactococcus lactis FnBPA+.\n# Abstract: The use of the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis as a vehicle for the oral delivery of DNA vaccine plasmids constitutes a promising strategy for vaccination. The delivery of DNA plasmids into eukaryotic cells is of critical importance for subsequent DNA expression and effectiveness of the vaccine. In this context, the use of the recombinant invasive L. lactis FnBPA+ (fibronectin-binding protein A) strain for the oral delivery of the eukaryotic expression vector vaccination using lactic acid bacteria (pValac), coding for the 6-kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6) gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, could represent a new DNA vaccine strategy against tuberculosis. To this end, the ESAT-6 sequence was cloned into the pValac vector; the L. lactis fibronectin-binding protein A (FnBPA)+ (pValac:ESAT-6) strain was obtained, and its immunological profile was checked in BALB/c mice. This strain was able to significantly increase interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production in spleen cells, showing a systemic T helper 1 (Th1) cell response. The mice also showed a significant increase in specific secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) production in colon tissue and fecal extracts. Thus, this is the first time that L. lactis has been used to deliver a plasmid DNA harboring a gene that encodes an antigen against tuberculosis through mucous membranes.",
      "# Title: Lactococcus lactis displayed neuraminidase confers cross protective immunity against influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Influenza A viruses pose a serious threat to public health. Current influenza A vaccines predominantly focus on hemagglutinin (HA) and show strain-specific protection. Neuraminidase (NA) is much less studied in the context of humoral immunity against influenza A viruses. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cross protective immunity of NA presented on Lactococcus lactis (L.lactis) surface against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in the mouse model. L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA was constructed in which pgsA was used as an anchor protein. Mice vaccinated orally with L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA could elicit significant NA-specific serum IgG and mucosa IgA antibodies, as well as neuraminidase inhibition (NI) titers. Importantly, L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA provided 80% protection against H5N1, 60% protection against H3N2 and H1N1, respectively. These findings suggest that recombinant L.lactis/pNZ110-pgsA-NA in the absence of adjuvant via oral administration can be served as an effective vaccine candidate against diverse strains of influenza A viruses.",
      "# Title: Broadly protective immunity against divergent influenza viruses by oral co-administration of Lactococcus lactis expressing nucleoprotein adjuvanted with cholera toxin B subunit in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines need to be annually reformulated to well match the predicated circulating strains. Thus, it is critical for developing a novel universal influenza vaccine that would be able to confer cross-protection against constantly emerging divergent influenza virus strains. Influenza virus A is a genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses. Influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) is a structural protein which encapsidates the negative strand viral RNA, and anti-NP antibodies play role in cross-protective immunity. Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) is an ideal vaccine delivery vehicle via oral administration route. However, L. lactis vectored vaccine exhibits poor immunogenicity without the use of mucosal adjuvant. To enhance the immunogenicity of L. lactis vectored vaccine, cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit, one of mucosal adjuvants, is a safe adjuvant for oral route, when combined with L. lactis vectored vaccine. In this study, we hypothesized that pNZ8008, a L. lactis expression plasmid, encoding NP antigen, would be able to elicit cross-protection with the use of CTB via oral administration route.",
      "# Title: Cross-protection of Lactococcus lactis-displayed HA2 subunit against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines provide strain-specific protection against homologous subtypes and need to be updated annually. Therefore, it is essential to develop a universal vaccine that would induce broadly cross-protective immunity against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses. The highly conserved HA2 subunit is a promising candidate for developing a universal influenza vaccine. Here, we hypothesized that the HA2 subunit could be displayed on the surface of Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis), using Spax as an anchor protein (L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2) and that L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 would have immunogenicity by oral administration without the use of adjuvant in the mouse model. To address this hypothesis, we show that oral vaccination of mice with L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 elicited significant humoral and mucosal immune responses. Importantly, L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 provided 100% protection against homologous H5N1 or heterologous H1N1 virus challenge. These results suggest that an HA2 subunit presented on the surface of L. lactis is an effective universal vaccine candidate against influenza A viruses in the poultry industry and in humans.",
      "# Title: Oral Immunization with a Recombinant Lactococcus lactis-Expressing HIV-1 Antigen on Group A Streptococcus Pilus Induces Strong Mucosal Immunity in the Gut.\n# Abstract: The induction of a potent humoral and cellular immune response in mucosal tissue is important for the development of an effective HIV vaccine. Most of the current HIV vaccines under development use the i.m. route for immunization, which is relatively poor in generating potent and long-lived mucosal immune responses. In this article, we explore the ability of an oral vaccination with a probiotic organism, Lactococcus lactis, to elicit HIV-specific immune responses in the mucosal and systemic compartments of BALB/c mice. We expressed the HIV-1 Gag-p24 on the tip of the T3 pilus of Streptococcus pyogenes as a fusion to the Cpa protein (LL-Gag). After four monthly LL-Gag oral immunizations, we observed strong Gag-specific IgG and IgA responses in serum, feces, and vaginal secretions. However, the Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses in the blood were at or below our detection limit. After an i.m. modified vaccinia Ankara/Gag boost, we observed robust Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses both in systemic and in mucosal tissues, including intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes of the small intestine, Peyer's patches, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Consistent with strong immunogenicity, the LL-Gag induced activation of CD11c(+) CD11b(+) dendritic cells in the Peyer's patches after oral immunization. Our results demonstrate that oral immunization with L. lactis expressing an Ag on the tip of the group A Streptococcus pilus serves as an excellent vaccine platform to induce strong mucosal humoral and cellular immunity against HIV.",

      "# Title: Production and delivery of Helicobacter pylori NapA in Lactococcus lactis and its protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity.\n# Abstract: Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein A subunit (NapA) has been identified as a virulence factor, a protective antigen and a potent immunomodulator. NapA shows unique application potentials for anti-H. pylori vaccines and treatment strategies of certain allergic diseases and carcinomas. However, appropriate production and utilization modes of NapA still remain uncertain to date. This work has established a novel efficient production and utilization mode of NapA by using L. lactis as an expression host and delivery vector, and demonstrated immune protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity of the engineered L. lactis by oral vaccination of mice. It was observed for the first time that H. pylori NapA promotes both polarized Th17 and Th1 responses, which may greatly affect the clinical application of NapA. This report offers a promising anti-H. pylori oral vaccine candidate and a potent mucosal immune modulatory agent. Meanwhile, it uncovers a way to produce and deliver the oral vaccine and immunomodulator by fermentation of food like milk, which might have striking effects on control of H. pylori infection, gastrointestinal cancers, and Th2 bias allergic diseases, including many food allergies.",
      "# Title: Protective immunity induced by an intranasal multivalent vaccine comprising 10 Lactococcus lactis strains expressing highly prevalent M-protein antigens derived from Group A Streptococcus.\n# Abstract: Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) causes diseases ranging from mild pharyngitis to severe invasive infections. The N-terminal fragment of streptococcal M protein elicits protective antibodies and is an attractive vaccine target. However, this N- terminal fragment is hypervariable: there are more than 200 different M types. In this study, an intranasal live bacterial vaccine comprising 10 strains of Lactococcus lactis, each expressing one N-terminal fragment of M protein, has been developed. Live bacterial-vectored vaccines cost less to manufacture because the processes involved are less complex than those required for production of protein subunit vaccines. Moreover, intranasal administration does not require syringes or specialized personnel. Evaluation of individual vaccine types (M1, M2, M3, M4, M6, M9, M12, M22, M28 and M77) showed that most of them protected mice against challenge with virulent S. pyogenes. All 10 strains combined in a 10-valent vaccine (M×10) induced serum and bronchoalveolar lavage IgG titers that ranged from three- to 10-fold those of unimmunized mice. After intranasal challenge with M28 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice was significantly higher than that of unimmunized mice. In contrast, when mice were challenged with M75 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice did not differ significantly from that of unimmunized mice. Mx-10 immunized mice had significantly less S. pyogenes in oropharyngeal washes and developed less severe disease symptoms after challenge than did unimmunized mice. Our L. lactis-based vaccine may provide an alternative solution to development of broadly protective group A streptococcal vaccines.",
      "# Title: Mucosal and systemic immune responses elicited by recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a fusion protein composed of pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin from Bordetella pertussis.\n# Abstract: We constructed a food-grade expression system harboring a F1S1 fusion protein of Bordetella pertussis to be produced in Lactococcus lactis NZ3900 as a new oral vaccine model against whooping cough, caused by B. pertussis. F1S1 was composed of N-terminally truncated S1 subunit of pertussis toxin and type I immunodominant domain of filamentous hemagglutinin which are both known as protective immunogens against pertussis. The recombinant L. lactis was administered via oral or intranasal routes to BALB/c mice and the related specific systemic and mucosal immune responses were then evaluated. The results indicated significantly higher levels of specific IgA in the lung extracts and IgG in sera of mucosally-immunized mice, compared to their controls. It was revealed that higher levels of IgG2a, compared to IgG1, were produced in all mucosally-immunized mice. Moreover, immunized mice developed Th1 responses with high levels of IFN-γ production by the spleen cells. These findings provide evidence for L. lactis to be used as a suitable vehicle for expression and delivery of F1S1 fusion protein to mucosa and induction of appropriate systemic and mucosal immune responses against pertussis.",
      "# Title: Rotavirus VP6 protein mucosally delivered by cell wall-derived particles from Lactococcus lactis induces protection against infection in a murine model.\n# Abstract: Rotaviruses are the primary cause of acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide. Although the implementation of live attenuated vaccines has reduced the number of rotavirus-associated deaths, variance in their effectiveness has been reported in different countries. This fact, among other concerns, leads to continuous efforts for the development of new generation of vaccines against rotavirus.In this work, we describe the obtention of cell wall-derived particles from a recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a cell wall-anchored version of the rotavirus VP6 protein. After confirming by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, flow cytometry and electronic immunomicroscopy that these particles were carrying the VP6 protein, their immunogenic potential was evaluated in adult BALB/c mice. For that, mucosal immunizations (oral or intranasal), with or without the dmLT [(double mutant Escherichia coli heat labile toxin LT(R192G/L211A)] adjuvant were performed. The results showed that these cell wall-derived particles were able to generate anti-rotavirus IgG and IgA antibodies only when administered intranasally, whether the adjuvant was present or not. However, the presence of dmLT was necessary to confer protection against rotavirus infection, which was evidenced by a 79.5 percent viral shedding reduction.In summary, this work describes the production of cell wall-derived particles which were able to induce a protective immune response after intranasal immunization. Further studies are needed to characterize the immune response elicited by these particles as well as to determine their potential as an alternative to the use of live L. lactis for mucosal antigen delivery.",
      "# Title: Extracellular overproduction of E7 oncoprotein of Iranian human papillomavirus type 16 by genetically engineered Lactococcus lactis.\n# Abstract: We aimed at constructing Lactococcus lactis strains expressing HPV-16 recombinant E7 (rE7) oncoprotein and examining its overproduction ability followed by optimizing batch and fed-batch fermentations. Thereafter, in order to assess the immunogenicity of recombinant L. lactis cells, C57BL/6 mice were immunized by oral gavage.",
      "# Title: A Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB)-Based Vaccine Candidate for Human Norovirus.\n# Abstract: Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are responsible for more than 95% of the non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis epidemics in the world. The CDC estimates that every year 21 million individuals suffer from HuNoV-induced gastroenteritis in the United States. Currently, there is no FDA-approved vaccine for HuNoVs. Development of an effective vaccine has been hampered by the lack of an efficient cell culture system for HuNoVs and a suitable small animal model for pathogenesis study. In this study, we developed lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as a vector to deliver HuNoV antigen. A LAB strain (Lactococcus lactis) carrying VP1 gene of a HuNoV GII.4 virus (LAB-VP1) was constructed. It was found that HuNoV VP1 protein was highly expressed by LAB vector and was secreted into media supernatants. To test whether LAB-based HuNoV vaccine candidate is immunogenic, 4-day-old gnotobiotic piglets were orally inoculated with various doses of LAB-VP1. It was found that LABs were persistent in the small intestine of piglets and shed in pig feces for at least 25 days post inoculation. LAB DNA and VP1 were detected in mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen tissue in LAB-VP1 inoculated groups. HuNoV-specific IgG and IgA were detectable in serum and feces respectively at day 13 post-inoculation, and further increased at later time points. After being challenged with HuNoV GII.4 strain, a large amount of HuNoV antigens were observed in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum sections of the intestine in the LAB control group. In contrast, significantly less, or no, HuNoV antigens were detected in the LAB-VP1 immunized groups. Collectively, these results demonstrate that a LAB-based HuNoV vaccine induces protective immunity in gnotobiotic piglets.",

      "# Title: A food-grade engineered Lactococcus lactis strain delivering Helicobacter pylori Lpp20 alleviates bacterial infection in H. pylori-challenged mice.\n# Abstract: To construct a food-grade bacterium producing and delivering H. pylori Lpp20 antigen and evaluate its immune efficacy against H. pylori challenges with aim to develop anti-H. pylori oral vaccines and functional foods.",
      "# Title: Mucosal Vaccination with Lactococcus lactis-Secreting Surface Immunological Protein Induces Humoral and Cellular Immune Protection against Group B Streptococcus in a Murine Model.\n# Abstract: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the primary etiological agent of sepsis and meningitis in newborns and is associated with premature birth and stillbirth. The development of a licensed vaccine is one of the pending challenges for the World Health Organization. Previously, we showed that oral immunization with surface immune protein (SIP) decreases vaginal colonization of GBS and generates functional opsonizing antibodies, which was determined by opsonophagocytic assays (OPA) in vitro. We also showed that the protein has an adjuvant vaccine profile. Therefore, an oral vaccine based on SIP may be an attractive alternative to employ in the development of new vaccines against GBS. Lactococcus lactis is a highlighted oral vaccine probiotic inducer of the mucosal immune response. This bacterium could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of an edible vaccine and has been used in clinical trials. In this study, we showed that an oral vaccine with a recombinant L. lactis strain secreting SIP from GBS (rL. lactis-SIP) can induce protective humoral and cellular immunity in an experimental model of GBS vaginal colonization in C57BL/6 mice. Mice immunized with rL. lactis-SIP were protected against clinical symptoms and bacterial colonization after GBS vaginal colonization. Our rL. lactis-SIP vaccine also induces an increase of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) specifically against SIP. The adoptive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice to naïve mice generated protection against GBS vaginal colonization. Moreover, the rL. lactis-SIP strain induces the activation of SIP-specific T cells, which could decrease GBS vaginal colonization and generate protective antibodies when transferred to other mice. Our experimental observations strongly support the notion that rL. lactis-SIP induces protective humoral and cellular immunity and could be considered as a novel alternative in the development of vaccines for GBS.",
      "# Title: Recombinant Lactococcus Lactis Displaying Omp31 Antigen of Brucella melitensis Can Induce an Immunogenic Response in BALB/c Mice.\n# Abstract: Since Brucella infection mostly occurs through the mucosal surfaces, immune response induced by vaccine that is delivered by a way of mucosal route can be drastically enhanced to control the brucellosis. Omp31is the major outer membrane protein of Brucella, and is considered as a protective antigen against Brucella infection. Accordingly, Lactococcus lactis has been used as an antigen-delivering vector to develop a vaccine-induced mucosal response for having a safer vaccination against brucellosis. A designed omp31 gene fused to the usp45 signal peptide and M6 cell wall anchor was sub cloned in the pNZ7021 expression vector, and a recombinant L. lactis displaying Omp31 was constructed. Omp31 protein expression was confirmed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. Animals were orally and intraperitoneally immunized with live or killed L. lactis expressing Omp31, respectively. The humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated by measuring the specific cytokines and antibodies. sIgA, serum IgA, IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in the mice immunized with live recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31 and also serum IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in mice immunized with killed recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31. Among IgG subtypes, IgG2a response was significantly higher in both groups compared to IgG1. In mice groups immunized with recombinant L. lactis, the IFN-γ and IL-10 level elevated; however, there was no change in the level of IL-4. These results indicated that recombinants L. lactis induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, and also vaccines based on L. lactis-derived live carriers are promising interventions against Brucella melitensis infections.",
      "# Title: Lactococcus lactis FNBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) Induces Cellular and Humoral Immune Responses After Oral Immunization of Mice.\n# Abstract: The development of a new vaccine strategy against tuberculosis is urgently needed and has been greatly encouraged by the scientific community worldwide. In this work, we constructed a lactococcal DNA vaccine based on the fusion of two Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens, ESAT-6 and Ag85A, and examined its immunogenicity. The coding sequences of the ESAT-6 and Ag85A genes were fused and cloned into the eukaryotic expression pValac vector, and the functionality of the vector was confirmed in vitro. Then, L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) was obtained and used for oral immunization of mice. This strain induced significant increases in IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-17 cytokines in stimulated splenocyte cultures, and significant production of antigen-specific sIgA was observed in the colonic tissues of immunized mice. We demonstrated that L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) generated a cellular and humoral immune response after oral immunization of mice. The strategy developed in this work may represent an interesting DNA mucosal vaccine candidate against tuberculosis, using the fusion of two highly immunogenic antigens delivered by safe lactic acid bacteria.",
      "# Title: Protective Immunity Against Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli by Oral Vaccination of Engineered Lactococcus lactis.\n# Abstract: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the leading causes of diarrhea in children globally, and thus suitable vaccines are desired. Antigen display on lactic acid bacteria is a reliable approach for efficient oral vaccination and preventing bowel diseases. To develop an oral vaccine against ETEC, the gene of the binding domain from heat-labile toxin (LTB), a key ETEC virulence factor, was codon-optimized and cloned into a construct containing a signal peptide and an anchor for display on L. lactis. Bioinformatics analysis showed a codon adaptation index of 0.95 for the codon-optimized gene. Cell surface expression of LTB was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and blotting. White New Zealand rabbits were immunized per os (PO) with the recombinant L. lactis, and the antibody titers were assayed with ELISA. In vitro neutralization assay was performed using mouse adrenal tumor cells and rabbit ileal loop test was performed as the in vivo assay. ELISA results indicated that oral administration of the engineered L. lactis elicited a significant production of IgA in the intestine. In vitro neutralization assay showed that the effect of the toxin could be neutralized with 500 µg/ml of IgG isolated from the oral vaccine group. Furthermore, the dose of ETEC causing fluid accumulation in the ileal loop test showed a tenfold increase in rabbits immunized with either recombinant L. lactis or LTB protein compared to other groups. Our results imply that recombinant L. lactis could potentially be an effective live oral vaccine against ETEC toxicity.",
      "# Title: Oral Immunization of Mice with Cell Extracts from Recombinant Lactococcus lactis Expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein.\n# Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all over the world and became a pandemic that named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). At present, several intramuscular vaccines have been successfully developed and mass vaccination has progressed in many countries. The aim of the study is to develop and examine an oral vaccine against COVID-19 with recombinant Lactococcus lactis IL1403, a strain of lactic acid bacteria, expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) S1 subunit as an immunizing antigen. PBS or cell extracts from recombinant L. lactis were orally administered into mice (control VS treatment), and formation of antigen-specific antibodies and changes in the gut microbiome were analyzed. Intracellular antigen was detected, but its secretion was not successful. After immunization, antigen-specific serum IgG and fecal IgA levels were 1.5-fold (P = 0.002) and 1.4-fold (P = 0.016) higher in the immunized mice (treatment) than control, respectively. Gut microbiome profiles were clearly separated between the two groups when analyzed for beta diversity with overall similarity. At the genus level, while Coprococcus (P = 0.036) and unclassified genus of Ruminococcaceae (P = 0.037) in treatment were more abundant than control, rc4-4 (P = 0.013) and Stenotrophomonas (P = 0.021) were less abundant. Our results indicate that cell extract containing SARS-CoV-2 antigen can induce mice to produce antigen-specific antibodies without overall changes in the gut microbiome. This strategy may be useful for the development of other oral viral vaccines.",
      "# Title: Oral Immunization With a M Cell-Targeting Recombinant L. Lactis Vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE Stimulate Protective Immunity Against H. Pylori in Mice.\n# Abstract: There are many virulence factors of H. pylori that contribute in diverse ways to gastric disease. Therefore, designing multivalent epitope vaccines against many key virulence factors virulence factors of H. pylori is a promising strategy to control H. pylori infection. In previous studies, we constructed a multivalent epitope vaccine FVpE against four key virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), and oral immunization with the FVpE vaccine plus a polysaccharide adjuvant (PA) containing lycium barbarum polysaccharide and chitosan could provide protection against H. pylori infection in the Mongolian gerbil model. Oral vaccines have many advantages over injected vaccines, such as improved safety and compliance, and easier manufacturing and administration. However, the harsh gastrointestinal (GI) environment, such as gastric acid and proteolytic enzymes, limits the development of oral vaccines to some extent. Oral vaccines need a gastrointestinal delivery system with high safety, low price and promoting vaccine antigen to stimulate immune response in the gastrointestinal mucosa. Lactic acid bacteria are gastrointestinal probiotics that have unique advantages as a delivery system for oral vaccines. In this study, a M cell-targeting surface display system for L. lactis named plSAM was designed to help vaccine antigens to stimulate effective immune responses in the gastrointestinal tract, and a M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE was constructed by using the surface display system plSAM. recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE could secretively express the SAM-FVpE protein and display it on the bacterial surface. Moreover, experimental results confirmed that LL-plSAM-FVpE had an enhanced M cell-targeting property. In addition, LL-plSAM-FVpE had excellent M cell-targeting property to promote the phagocytosis and transport of the antigen SAM-FVpE by gastrointestinal M cells. More importantly, oral immunization of LL-plSAM-FVpE or SAM-FVpE plus PA can stimulate IgG and sIgA antibodies and CD4+ T cell immune responses against four virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), thus providing protective immunity against H. pylori infection in mice. The M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine against various key H. pylori virulence factors could be a promising vaccine candidate for controlling H. pylori infection.",
      "# Title: Oral and intranasal immunization with food-grade recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing high conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein triggers mice's immunity responses.\n# Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic began at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread throughout the world. Vaccination is still the most effective method of prevention of pathogenic infections, including viral infections. However, there is little evidence that vaccination can protect against SARS-CoV-2 virus for a long time. Thus, regular re-vaccination is necessary to control COVID-19. Vaccination by injection is invasive, and is one of the reasons people refuse to get re-vaccinated. Therefore, we developed a less invasive vaccine based on oral or nasal administration. The gene encoding the high conserved region (HCR) spike protein was inserted into pNZ8149 and expressed in L.lactis NZ3900. Mice were immunized at 3-week intervals with oral or nasal routes. Anti-SARS-CoV2 spike antibody (IgG and IgA) level were measured using ELISA method before and after treatment. Plasma cells population in lymph were analyzed using flowcytometry and the CD4 + and CD8 + cells in lymph and intestine were analyzed using immunofluorescence method. The results of nasal and oral administration in experimental animals showed that L.lactis carrying the HCR gene could induce a humoral immune response, as indicated by increased levels of IgG and IgA against SARS-CoV-2 (IgG/IgA-SARS-CoV-2). The plasma cell population after nasal and oral vaccination in mice were significantly different with control group (p < 0.05). The CD4 + and CD8 + cells in intestine were significantly higher in orally immunized group mice than control group. The CD8 + cells in lymph were significantly higher in intranasal immunized group mice than control group. Our data demonstrate L.lactis expressing spike protein can be developed into a less invasive alternative to nasal and oral vaccination.",
      "# Title: Expanding strain coverage of a group A Streptococcus pilus-expressing Lactococcus lactis mucosal vaccine.\n# Abstract: Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a human pathogenic bacterium that can trigger a wide range of diseases, including the autoimmune diseases acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, causing major morbidity and mortality in many low- and middle-income countries. Primary intervention programs have had limited success thus far, and a licensed vaccine has yet to be developed. The pilus of GAS is known to be involved in host cell adhesion, biofilm formation and immune evasion. We have a mucosal vaccine in development that expresses the pilus of GAS on the surface of the nonpathogenic bacterium Lactococcus lactis. To expand strain coverage, we combined seven L. lactis constructs, each expressing a different GAS pilus variant, and investigated the systemic and mucosal immune responses following immunization. Mice immunized with this combination showed specific immunoglobin G and immunoglobin A responses to the GAS pilus proteins of vaccine strains, at levels comparable to mice immunized with a single construct. Cross-reactivity to pilus proteins of nonvaccine strains was also evident. Furthermore, protective efficacy against a homologous strain of GAS in a murine nasopharyngeal colonization model was observed. Overall, this study provides further evidence for using pilus-expressing lactic acid bacteria as a vaccine to prevent upper respiratory tract GAS infections."

    "referenceConclusion": "Increased frailty was associated with increased odds of any Clavien–Dindo 1-4 complication. Frailty measurements may be used as an integral component of risk-assessment strategies to improve the quality and value of neurosurgical care for patients undergoing craniotomy surgery. These findings suggest that preoperative frailty assessments could assist in risk-stratifying patients undergoing open cranial surgery. Increased odds of complications in frail patients can assist decision-makers in perioperative pathway planning and with informed consent. Increased odds of complications were a statistically robust outcome across a number of subgroups and sensitivity analyses.",

      "# Title: The modified frailty index and 30-day adverse events in oncologic neurosurgery.\n# Abstract: The modified frailty index (mFI) is emerging as a leading measure for preoperative risk assessment using routinely available medical record data. Our objective was to determine if mFI predicts morbidity and mortality in the diverse national cohort of patients undergoing neurosurgery for intracranial neoplasms. We identified patients in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program who underwent oncologic neurosurgery procedures between 2008 and 2012. The mFI, ranging from 0 to 1, was calculated as the proportion of 11 possible risk factors present. We assessed the associations between mFI and 30-day mortality, neurologic and medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge in univariate and multivariable analyses and compare the index to established risk stratification techniques. A total of 9149 patients were identified. Mortality, severe medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge increased incrementally with increasing levels of frailty. Severe neurologic complications were highest in those with low frailty. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, increased frailty increased the odds of all adverse outcomes, including neurologic complications. The mFI increased the ability to predict all outcomes beyond available indices and was the most reliable predictor of neurologic complications. The mFI can be calculated from routinely collected medical record data and is predictive of 30-day adverse outcomes in a wide variety of neurosurgical oncology patients. The index may be a useful component of preoperative risk assessment with implications for shared decision-making, perioperative planning, and risk adjusted outcomes measurement in national quality registries.",

When assessing quality of life for patients with brain tumors, having a better predictor of postsurgical outcome would be beneficial in counseling these patients. Frailty is thought to estimate physiologic reserves, and it has been found to predict postoperative complications, length of stay, and discharge to a skilled nursing facility or assisted living facility in patients undergoing various types of surgery. Frailty as an adjunct to preoperative assessment of neurosurgical patients has never been evaluated. This study aimed to determine whether frailty predicts neurosurgical complications in patients with brain tumors and enhances current perioperative risk models.",

      "# Title: Frailty and outcomes after craniotomy for brain tumor.\n# Abstract: Frailty has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in a variety of surgical disciplines. Few data exist regarding the relationship of frailty with adverse outcomes in craniotomy for brain tumor resection. We assessed the relationship between frailty and the incidence of major post-operative complication, discharge destination other than home, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality after elective craniotomy for brain tumor resection. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 20,333 adult patients undergoing elective craniotomy for tumor resection in the 2012-2018 ACS-NSQIP Participant Use File. Multivariate logistic regression was performed using all covariates deemed eligible through clinical and statistical significance. 6,249 patients (30.7%) were low-frailty and 2,148 patients (10.6%) were medium-to-high frailty. In multivariate logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, BMI, ASA classification, smoking status, dyspnea, significant pre-operative weight loss, chronic steroid use, bleeding disorder, tumor type, and operative time, low frailty was associated with increased adjusted odds ratio of major complication (1.41, 95% CI: 1.23-1.60, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.32, 95% CI: 1.20-1.46, p < 0.001), 30-day readmission (1.29, 95% CI: 1.15-1.44, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (1.87, 95% CI: 1.41-2.47, p < 0.001). Moderate-to-high frailty was also associated with increased adjusted odds of major complication (1.61, 95% CI: 1.35-1.92, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.80, 95% CI: 1.58-2.05), 30-day readmission (1.39, 95% CI: 1.19-1.62, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (2.42, 95% CI: 1.74-3.38, p < 0.001).

      "# Title: Expression of a hepatitis A virus antigen in Lactococcus lactis and Escherichia coli and evaluation of its immunogenicity.\n# Abstract: An epidemic shift in Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection has been observed in recent years in rapidly developing countries, with increasing numbers of severe adult cases which has led to renewed interest in vaccination. Our approach in vaccine development uses recombinant expression of the highly immunogenic HAV antigen VP1-P2a in food-grade lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis and in Escherichia coli. We used genetic constructs that enable nisin-controlled expression of the antigen in L. lactis in three different forms: (a) intracellularly, (b) on the bacterial surface and (c) on the bacterial surface fused with the fragment of the E. coli flagellin molecule that can act as a molecular adjuvant. Expression of the two surface forms of the antigen was achieved in L. lactis, and the resulting antigen-displaying bacteria were administered orally to mice. Half the animals in each of the two groups developed specific IgGs, with titers increasing over time and reaching 1:422 without flagellin and 1:320 with flagellin. A much higher titer 1:25,803 was observed with the parenterally administered antigen, which was purified from E. coli. With the latter, a significant mucosal IgA response was also observed. Despite significant titers, the IgGs elicited with oral or parenteral administration could not prevent HAV from infecting cells in a virus neutralization assay, suggesting that the antibodies cannot recognize viral surface epitopes. Nevertheless, orally administered HAV antigen expressed in L. lactis elicited significant systemic humoral immune response showing the feasibility for development of effective HAV vaccine for mucosal delivery.",
      "# Title: Oral immunization with recombinant Lactococcus lactis delivering a multi-epitope antigen CTB-UE attenuates Helicobacter pylori infection in mice.\n# Abstract: Urease is an essential virulence factor and colonization factor for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and is considered as an excellent vaccine candidate antigen. However, conventional technologies for preparing an injectable vaccine require purification of the antigenic protein and preparation of an adjuvant. Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 (L. lactis) could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of edible vaccine. In previous study, we constructed a multi-epitope vaccine, designated CTB-UE, which is composed of the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), three Th cell epitopes and two B-cell epitopes from urease subunits. To develop a novel type of oral vaccine against H. pylori, genetically modified L. lactis strains were established to secrete this epitope vaccine extracellularly in this study. Oral prophylactic immunization with recombinant L. lactis significantly elicited humoral anti-urease antibody responses (P < 0.001) and reduced the gastric colonization of H. pylori from 7.14 ± 0.95 to 4.68 ± 0.98 log10 CFU g(-1) stomach. This L. lactis oral vaccine offers a promising vaccine candidate for the control of H. pylori infection.",
      "# Title: Development of a new DNA vaccine based on mycobacterial ESAT-6 antigen delivered by recombinant invasive Lactococcus lactis FnBPA+.\n# Abstract: The use of the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis as a vehicle for the oral delivery of DNA vaccine plasmids constitutes a promising strategy for vaccination. The delivery of DNA plasmids into eukaryotic cells is of critical importance for subsequent DNA expression and effectiveness of the vaccine. In this context, the use of the recombinant invasive L. lactis FnBPA+ (fibronectin-binding protein A) strain for the oral delivery of the eukaryotic expression vector vaccination using lactic acid bacteria (pValac), coding for the 6-kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6) gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, could represent a new DNA vaccine strategy against tuberculosis. To this end, the ESAT-6 sequence was cloned into the pValac vector; the L. lactis fibronectin-binding protein A (FnBPA)+ (pValac:ESAT-6) strain was obtained, and its immunological profile was checked in BALB/c mice. This strain was able to significantly increase interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production in spleen cells, showing a systemic T helper 1 (Th1) cell response. The mice also showed a significant increase in specific secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) production in colon tissue and fecal extracts. Thus, this is the first time that L. lactis has been used to deliver a plasmid DNA harboring a gene that encodes an antigen against tuberculosis through mucous membranes.",
      "# Title: Lactococcus lactis displayed neuraminidase confers cross protective immunity against influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Influenza A viruses pose a serious threat to public health. Current influenza A vaccines predominantly focus on hemagglutinin (HA) and show strain-specific protection. Neuraminidase (NA) is much less studied in the context of humoral immunity against influenza A viruses. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cross protective immunity of NA presented on Lactococcus lactis (L.lactis) surface against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in the mouse model. L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA was constructed in which pgsA was used as an anchor protein. Mice vaccinated orally with L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA could elicit significant NA-specific serum IgG and mucosa IgA antibodies, as well as neuraminidase inhibition (NI) titers. Importantly, L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA provided 80% protection against H5N1, 60% protection against H3N2 and H1N1, respectively. These findings suggest that recombinant L.lactis/pNZ110-pgsA-NA in the absence of adjuvant via oral administration can be served as an effective vaccine candidate against diverse strains of influenza A viruses.",
      "# Title: Broadly protective immunity against divergent influenza viruses by oral co-administration of Lactococcus lactis expressing nucleoprotein adjuvanted with cholera toxin B subunit in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines need to be annually reformulated to well match the predicated circulating strains. Thus, it is critical for developing a novel universal influenza vaccine that would be able to confer cross-protection against constantly emerging divergent influenza virus strains. Influenza virus A is a genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses. Influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) is a structural protein which encapsidates the negative strand viral RNA, and anti-NP antibodies play role in cross-protective immunity. Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) is an ideal vaccine delivery vehicle via oral administration route. However, L. lactis vectored vaccine exhibits poor immunogenicity without the use of mucosal adjuvant. To enhance the immunogenicity of L. lactis vectored vaccine, cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit, one of mucosal adjuvants, is a safe adjuvant for oral route, when combined with L. lactis vectored vaccine. In this study, we hypothesized that pNZ8008, a L. lactis expression plasmid, encoding NP antigen, would be able to elicit cross-protection with the use of CTB via oral administration route.",
      "# Title: Cross-protection of Lactococcus lactis-displayed HA2 subunit against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines provide strain-specific protection against homologous subtypes and need to be updated annually. Therefore, it is essential to develop a universal vaccine that would induce broadly cross-protective immunity against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses. The highly conserved HA2 subunit is a promising candidate for developing a universal influenza vaccine. Here, we hypothesized that the HA2 subunit could be displayed on the surface of Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis), using Spax as an anchor protein (L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2) and that L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 would have immunogenicity by oral administration without the use of adjuvant in the mouse model. To address this hypothesis, we show that oral vaccination of mice with L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 elicited significant humoral and mucosal immune responses. Importantly, L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 provided 100% protection against homologous H5N1 or heterologous H1N1 virus challenge. These results suggest that an HA2 subunit presented on the surface of L. lactis is an effective universal vaccine candidate against influenza A viruses in the poultry industry and in humans.",
      "# Title: Oral Immunization with a Recombinant Lactococcus lactis-Expressing HIV-1 Antigen on Group A Streptococcus Pilus Induces Strong Mucosal Immunity in the Gut.\n# Abstract: The induction of a potent humoral and cellular immune response in mucosal tissue is important for the development of an effective HIV vaccine. Most of the current HIV vaccines under development use the i.m. route for immunization, which is relatively poor in generating potent and long-lived mucosal immune responses. In this article, we explore the ability of an oral vaccination with a probiotic organism, Lactococcus lactis, to elicit HIV-specific immune responses in the mucosal and systemic compartments of BALB/c mice. We expressed the HIV-1 Gag-p24 on the tip of the T3 pilus of Streptococcus pyogenes as a fusion to the Cpa protein (LL-Gag). After four monthly LL-Gag oral immunizations, we observed strong Gag-specific IgG and IgA responses in serum, feces, and vaginal secretions. However, the Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses in the blood were at or below our detection limit. After an i.m. modified vaccinia Ankara/Gag boost, we observed robust Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses both in systemic and in mucosal tissues, including intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes of the small intestine, Peyer's patches, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Consistent with strong immunogenicity, the LL-Gag induced activation of CD11c(+) CD11b(+) dendritic cells in the Peyer's patches after oral immunization. Our results demonstrate that oral immunization with L. lactis expressing an Ag on the tip of the group A Streptococcus pilus serves as an excellent vaccine platform to induce strong mucosal humoral and cellular immunity against HIV.",

      "# Title: Production and delivery of Helicobacter pylori NapA in Lactococcus lactis and its protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity.\n# Abstract: Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein A subunit (NapA) has been identified as a virulence factor, a protective antigen and a potent immunomodulator. NapA shows unique application potentials for anti-H. pylori vaccines and treatment strategies of certain allergic diseases and carcinomas. However, appropriate production and utilization modes of NapA still remain uncertain to date. This work has established a novel efficient production and utilization mode of NapA by using L. lactis as an expression host and delivery vector, and demonstrated immune protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity of the engineered L. lactis by oral vaccination of mice. It was observed for the first time that H. pylori NapA promotes both polarized Th17 and Th1 responses, which may greatly affect the clinical application of NapA. This report offers a promising anti-H. pylori oral vaccine candidate and a potent mucosal immune modulatory agent. Meanwhile, it uncovers a way to produce and deliver the oral vaccine and immunomodulator by fermentation of food like milk, which might have striking effects on control of H. pylori infection, gastrointestinal cancers, and Th2 bias allergic diseases, including many food allergies.",
      "# Title: Protective immunity induced by an intranasal multivalent vaccine comprising 10 Lactococcus lactis strains expressing highly prevalent M-protein antigens derived from Group A Streptococcus.\n# Abstract: Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) causes diseases ranging from mild pharyngitis to severe invasive infections. The N-terminal fragment of streptococcal M protein elicits protective antibodies and is an attractive vaccine target. However, this N- terminal fragment is hypervariable: there are more than 200 different M types. In this study, an intranasal live bacterial vaccine comprising 10 strains of Lactococcus lactis, each expressing one N-terminal fragment of M protein, has been developed. Live bacterial-vectored vaccines cost less to manufacture because the processes involved are less complex than those required for production of protein subunit vaccines. Moreover, intranasal administration does not require syringes or specialized personnel. Evaluation of individual vaccine types (M1, M2, M3, M4, M6, M9, M12, M22, M28 and M77) showed that most of them protected mice against challenge with virulent S. pyogenes. All 10 strains combined in a 10-valent vaccine (M×10) induced serum and bronchoalveolar lavage IgG titers that ranged from three- to 10-fold those of unimmunized mice. After intranasal challenge with M28 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice was significantly higher than that of unimmunized mice. In contrast, when mice were challenged with M75 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice did not differ significantly from that of unimmunized mice. Mx-10 immunized mice had significantly less S. pyogenes in oropharyngeal washes and developed less severe disease symptoms after challenge than did unimmunized mice. Our L. lactis-based vaccine may provide an alternative solution to development of broadly protective group A streptococcal vaccines.",
      "# Title: Mucosal and systemic immune responses elicited by recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a fusion protein composed of pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin from Bordetella pertussis.\n# Abstract: We constructed a food-grade expression system harboring a F1S1 fusion protein of Bordetella pertussis to be produced in Lactococcus lactis NZ3900 as a new oral vaccine model against whooping cough, caused by B. pertussis. F1S1 was composed of N-terminally truncated S1 subunit of pertussis toxin and type I immunodominant domain of filamentous hemagglutinin which are both known as protective immunogens against pertussis. The recombinant L. lactis was administered via oral or intranasal routes to BALB/c mice and the related specific systemic and mucosal immune responses were then evaluated. The results indicated significantly higher levels of specific IgA in the lung extracts and IgG in sera of mucosally-immunized mice, compared to their controls. It was revealed that higher levels of IgG2a, compared to IgG1, were produced in all mucosally-immunized mice. Moreover, immunized mice developed Th1 responses with high levels of IFN-γ production by the spleen cells. These findings provide evidence for L. lactis to be used as a suitable vehicle for expression and delivery of F1S1 fusion protein to mucosa and induction of appropriate systemic and mucosal immune responses against pertussis.",
      "# Title: Rotavirus VP6 protein mucosally delivered by cell wall-derived particles from Lactococcus lactis induces protection against infection in a murine model.\n# Abstract: Rotaviruses are the primary cause of acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide. Although the implementation of live attenuated vaccines has reduced the number of rotavirus-associated deaths, variance in their effectiveness has been reported in different countries. This fact, among other concerns, leads to continuous efforts for the development of new generation of vaccines against rotavirus.In this work, we describe the obtention of cell wall-derived particles from a recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a cell wall-anchored version of the rotavirus VP6 protein. After confirming by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, flow cytometry and electronic immunomicroscopy that these particles were carrying the VP6 protein, their immunogenic potential was evaluated in adult BALB/c mice. For that, mucosal immunizations (oral or intranasal), with or without the dmLT [(double mutant Escherichia coli heat labile toxin LT(R192G/L211A)] adjuvant were performed. The results showed that these cell wall-derived particles were able to generate anti-rotavirus IgG and IgA antibodies only when administered intranasally, whether the adjuvant was present or not. However, the presence of dmLT was necessary to confer protection against rotavirus infection, which was evidenced by a 79.5 percent viral shedding reduction.In summary, this work describes the production of cell wall-derived particles which were able to induce a protective immune response after intranasal immunization. Further studies are needed to characterize the immune response elicited by these particles as well as to determine their potential as an alternative to the use of live L. lactis for mucosal antigen delivery.",

      "# Title: A Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB)-Based Vaccine Candidate for Human Norovirus.\n# Abstract: Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are responsible for more than 95% of the non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis epidemics in the world. The CDC estimates that every year 21 million individuals suffer from HuNoV-induced gastroenteritis in the United States. Currently, there is no FDA-approved vaccine for HuNoVs. Development of an effective vaccine has been hampered by the lack of an efficient cell culture system for HuNoVs and a suitable small animal model for pathogenesis study. In this study, we developed lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as a vector to deliver HuNoV antigen. A LAB strain (Lactococcus lactis) carrying VP1 gene of a HuNoV GII.4 virus (LAB-VP1) was constructed. It was found that HuNoV VP1 protein was highly expressed by LAB vector and was secreted into media supernatants. To test whether LAB-based HuNoV vaccine candidate is immunogenic, 4-day-old gnotobiotic piglets were orally inoculated with various doses of LAB-VP1. It was found that LABs were persistent in the small intestine of piglets and shed in pig feces for at least 25 days post inoculation. LAB DNA and VP1 were detected in mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen tissue in LAB-VP1 inoculated groups. HuNoV-specific IgG and IgA were detectable in serum and feces respectively at day 13 post-inoculation, and further increased at later time points. After being challenged with HuNoV GII.4 strain, a large amount of HuNoV antigens were observed in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum sections of the intestine in the LAB control group. In contrast, significantly less, or no, HuNoV antigens were detected in the LAB-VP1 immunized groups. Collectively, these results demonstrate that a LAB-based HuNoV vaccine induces protective immunity in gnotobiotic piglets.",

      "# Title: Mucosal Vaccination with Lactococcus lactis-Secreting Surface Immunological Protein Induces Humoral and Cellular Immune Protection against Group B Streptococcus in a Murine Model.\n# Abstract: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the primary etiological agent of sepsis and meningitis in newborns and is associated with premature birth and stillbirth. The development of a licensed vaccine is one of the pending challenges for the World Health Organization. Previously, we showed that oral immunization with surface immune protein (SIP) decreases vaginal colonization of GBS and generates functional opsonizing antibodies, which was determined by opsonophagocytic assays (OPA) in vitro. We also showed that the protein has an adjuvant vaccine profile. Therefore, an oral vaccine based on SIP may be an attractive alternative to employ in the development of new vaccines against GBS. Lactococcus lactis is a highlighted oral vaccine probiotic inducer of the mucosal immune response. This bacterium could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of an edible vaccine and has been used in clinical trials. In this study, we showed that an oral vaccine with a recombinant L. lactis strain secreting SIP from GBS (rL. lactis-SIP) can induce protective humoral and cellular immunity in an experimental model of GBS vaginal colonization in C57BL/6 mice. Mice immunized with rL. lactis-SIP were protected against clinical symptoms and bacterial colonization after GBS vaginal colonization. Our rL. lactis-SIP vaccine also induces an increase of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) specifically against SIP. The adoptive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice to naïve mice generated protection against GBS vaginal colonization. Moreover, the rL. lactis-SIP strain induces the activation of SIP-specific T cells, which could decrease GBS vaginal colonization and generate protective antibodies when transferred to other mice. Our experimental observations strongly support the notion that rL. lactis-SIP induces protective humoral and cellular immunity and could be considered as a novel alternative in the development of vaccines for GBS.",
      "# Title: Recombinant Lactococcus Lactis Displaying Omp31 Antigen of Brucella melitensis Can Induce an Immunogenic Response in BALB/c Mice.\n# Abstract: Since Brucella infection mostly occurs through the mucosal surfaces, immune response induced by vaccine that is delivered by a way of mucosal route can be drastically enhanced to control the brucellosis. Omp31is the major outer membrane protein of Brucella, and is considered as a protective antigen against Brucella infection. Accordingly, Lactococcus lactis has been used as an antigen-delivering vector to develop a vaccine-induced mucosal response for having a safer vaccination against brucellosis. A designed omp31 gene fused to the usp45 signal peptide and M6 cell wall anchor was sub cloned in the pNZ7021 expression vector, and a recombinant L. lactis displaying Omp31 was constructed. Omp31 protein expression was confirmed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. Animals were orally and intraperitoneally immunized with live or killed L. lactis expressing Omp31, respectively. The humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated by measuring the specific cytokines and antibodies. sIgA, serum IgA, IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in the mice immunized with live recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31 and also serum IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in mice immunized with killed recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31. Among IgG subtypes, IgG2a response was significantly higher in both groups compared to IgG1. In mice groups immunized with recombinant L. lactis, the IFN-γ and IL-10 level elevated; however, there was no change in the level of IL-4. These results indicated that recombinants L. lactis induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, and also vaccines based on L. lactis-derived live carriers are promising interventions against Brucella melitensis infections.",
      "# Title: Lactococcus lactis FNBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) Induces Cellular and Humoral Immune Responses After Oral Immunization of Mice.\n# Abstract: The development of a new vaccine strategy against tuberculosis is urgently needed and has been greatly encouraged by the scientific community worldwide. In this work, we constructed a lactococcal DNA vaccine based on the fusion of two Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens, ESAT-6 and Ag85A, and examined its immunogenicity. The coding sequences of the ESAT-6 and Ag85A genes were fused and cloned into the eukaryotic expression pValac vector, and the functionality of the vector was confirmed in vitro. Then, L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) was obtained and used for oral immunization of mice. This strain induced significant increases in IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-17 cytokines in stimulated splenocyte cultures, and significant production of antigen-specific sIgA was observed in the colonic tissues of immunized mice. We demonstrated that L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) generated a cellular and humoral immune response after oral immunization of mice. The strategy developed in this work may represent an interesting DNA mucosal vaccine candidate against tuberculosis, using the fusion of two highly immunogenic antigens delivered by safe lactic acid bacteria.",
      "# Title: Protective Immunity Against Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli by Oral Vaccination of Engineered Lactococcus lactis.\n# Abstract: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the leading causes of diarrhea in children globally, and thus suitable vaccines are desired. Antigen display on lactic acid bacteria is a reliable approach for efficient oral vaccination and preventing bowel diseases. To develop an oral vaccine against ETEC, the gene of the binding domain from heat-labile toxin (LTB), a key ETEC virulence factor, was codon-optimized and cloned into a construct containing a signal peptide and an anchor for display on L. lactis. Bioinformatics analysis showed a codon adaptation index of 0.95 for the codon-optimized gene. Cell surface expression of LTB was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and blotting. White New Zealand rabbits were immunized per os (PO) with the recombinant L. lactis, and the antibody titers were assayed with ELISA. In vitro neutralization assay was performed using mouse adrenal tumor cells and rabbit ileal loop test was performed as the in vivo assay. ELISA results indicated that oral administration of the engineered L. lactis elicited a significant production of IgA in the intestine. In vitro neutralization assay showed that the effect of the toxin could be neutralized with 500 µg/ml of IgG isolated from the oral vaccine group. Furthermore, the dose of ETEC causing fluid accumulation in the ileal loop test showed a tenfold increase in rabbits immunized with either recombinant L. lactis or LTB protein compared to other groups. Our results imply that recombinant L. lactis could potentially be an effective live oral vaccine against ETEC toxicity.",
      "# Title: Oral Immunization of Mice with Cell Extracts from Recombinant Lactococcus lactis Expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein.\n# Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all over the world and became a pandemic that named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). At present, several intramuscular vaccines have been successfully developed and mass vaccination has progressed in many countries. The aim of the study is to develop and examine an oral vaccine against COVID-19 with recombinant Lactococcus lactis IL1403, a strain of lactic acid bacteria, expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) S1 subunit as an immunizing antigen. PBS or cell extracts from recombinant L. lactis were orally administered into mice (control VS treatment), and formation of antigen-specific antibodies and changes in the gut microbiome were analyzed. Intracellular antigen was detected, but its secretion was not successful. After immunization, antigen-specific serum IgG and fecal IgA levels were 1.5-fold (P = 0.002) and 1.4-fold (P = 0.016) higher in the immunized mice (treatment) than control, respectively. Gut microbiome profiles were clearly separated between the two groups when analyzed for beta diversity with overall similarity. At the genus level, while Coprococcus (P = 0.036) and unclassified genus of Ruminococcaceae (P = 0.037) in treatment were more abundant than control, rc4-4 (P = 0.013) and Stenotrophomonas (P = 0.021) were less abundant. Our results indicate that cell extract containing SARS-CoV-2 antigen can induce mice to produce antigen-specific antibodies without overall changes in the gut microbiome. This strategy may be useful for the development of other oral viral vaccines.",
      "# Title: Oral Immunization With a M Cell-Targeting Recombinant L. Lactis Vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE Stimulate Protective Immunity Against H. Pylori in Mice.\n# Abstract: There are many virulence factors of H. pylori that contribute in diverse ways to gastric disease. Therefore, designing multivalent epitope vaccines against many key virulence factors virulence factors of H. pylori is a promising strategy to control H. pylori infection. In previous studies, we constructed a multivalent epitope vaccine FVpE against four key virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), and oral immunization with the FVpE vaccine plus a polysaccharide adjuvant (PA) containing lycium barbarum polysaccharide and chitosan could provide protection against H. pylori infection in the Mongolian gerbil model. Oral vaccines have many advantages over injected vaccines, such as improved safety and compliance, and easier manufacturing and administration. However, the harsh gastrointestinal (GI) environment, such as gastric acid and proteolytic enzymes, limits the development of oral vaccines to some extent. Oral vaccines need a gastrointestinal delivery system with high safety, low price and promoting vaccine antigen to stimulate immune response in the gastrointestinal mucosa. Lactic acid bacteria are gastrointestinal probiotics that have unique advantages as a delivery system for oral vaccines. In this study, a M cell-targeting surface display system for L. lactis named plSAM was designed to help vaccine antigens to stimulate effective immune responses in the gastrointestinal tract, and a M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE was constructed by using the surface display system plSAM. recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE could secretively express the SAM-FVpE protein and display it on the bacterial surface. Moreover, experimental results confirmed that LL-plSAM-FVpE had an enhanced M cell-targeting property. In addition, LL-plSAM-FVpE had excellent M cell-targeting property to promote the phagocytosis and transport of the antigen SAM-FVpE by gastrointestinal M cells. More importantly, oral immunization of LL-plSAM-FVpE or SAM-FVpE plus PA can stimulate IgG and sIgA antibodies and CD4+ T cell immune responses against four virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), thus providing protective immunity against H. pylori infection in mice. The M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine against various key H. pylori virulence factors could be a promising vaccine candidate for controlling H. pylori infection.",
      "# Title: Oral and intranasal immunization with food-grade recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing high conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein triggers mice's immunity responses.\n# Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic began at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread throughout the world. Vaccination is still the most effective method of prevention of pathogenic infections, including viral infections. However, there is little evidence that vaccination can protect against SARS-CoV-2 virus for a long time. Thus, regular re-vaccination is necessary to control COVID-19. Vaccination by injection is invasive, and is one of the reasons people refuse to get re-vaccinated. Therefore, we developed a less invasive vaccine based on oral or nasal administration. The gene encoding the high conserved region (HCR) spike protein was inserted into pNZ8149 and expressed in L.lactis NZ3900. Mice were immunized at 3-week intervals with oral or nasal routes. Anti-SARS-CoV2 spike antibody (IgG and IgA) level were measured using ELISA method before and after treatment. Plasma cells population in lymph were analyzed using flowcytometry and the CD4 + and CD8 + cells in lymph and intestine were analyzed using immunofluorescence method. The results of nasal and oral administration in experimental animals showed that L.lactis carrying the HCR gene could induce a humoral immune response, as indicated by increased levels of IgG and IgA against SARS-CoV-2 (IgG/IgA-SARS-CoV-2). The plasma cell population after nasal and oral vaccination in mice were significantly different with control group (p < 0.05). The CD4 + and CD8 + cells in intestine were significantly higher in orally immunized group mice than control group. The CD8 + cells in lymph were significantly higher in intranasal immunized group mice than control group. Our data demonstrate L.lactis expressing spike protein can be developed into a less invasive alternative to nasal and oral vaccination.",
      "# Title: Expanding strain coverage of a group A Streptococcus pilus-expressing Lactococcus lactis mucosal vaccine.\n# Abstract: Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a human pathogenic bacterium that can trigger a wide range of diseases, including the autoimmune diseases acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, causing major morbidity and mortality in many low- and middle-income countries. Primary intervention programs have had limited success thus far, and a licensed vaccine has yet to be developed. The pilus of GAS is known to be involved in host cell adhesion, biofilm formation and immune evasion. We have a mucosal vaccine in development that expresses the pilus of GAS on the surface of the nonpathogenic bacterium Lactococcus lactis. To expand strain coverage, we combined seven L. lactis constructs, each expressing a different GAS pilus variant, and investigated the systemic and mucosal immune responses following immunization. Mice immunized with this combination showed specific immunoglobin G and immunoglobin A responses to the GAS pilus proteins of vaccine strains, at levels comparable to mice immunized with a single construct. Cross-reactivity to pilus proteins of nonvaccine strains was also evident. Furthermore, protective efficacy against a homologous strain of GAS in a murine nasopharyngeal colonization model was observed. Overall, this study provides further evidence for using pilus-expressing lactic acid bacteria as a vaccine to prevent upper respiratory tract GAS infections."

The current study analyzed the clinical significance of this new stage in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Subjects and Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 4045 eligible PTC patients. The patients were divided into four groups according to the extent of ETE: no ETE, ETE into perithyroidal tissue, T3b (ETE into the strap muscles), and ETE beyond the strap muscles. Differences in the clinical characteristics and prognosis of the four groups were assessed. Results: Of these 4045 patients, 2300 (56.9%) had no ETE, 1004 (24.8%) had ETE into perithyroidal tissue, 371 (9.2%) had ETE into the strap muscles, and 370 (9.1%) had ETE beyond the strap muscles. Tumor size, multifocality, lymph node metastasis (LNM), distant metastasis (DM), recurrence, and recurrence-free survival (RFS) between patients with ETE into perithyroidal tissue and patients without ETE did not show differences, but significant differences were observed between patients with T3b and patients without ETE, and only patients with ETE beyond the strap muscles had significantly worse overall survival (OS) than the other three groups. However, T3b did not independently predict worse RFS in univariable and multivariable analyses. Conclusions: T3b, distinguished from minimal ETE, may be related to larger tumor size, higher prevalence of multifocality, LNM, DM, recurrence, and worse RFS than no ETE, but it may not affect OS and may not independently predict recurrence in PTC patients.",
      "# Title: Is There a Difference Between Minimal and Gross Extension into the Strap Muscles for the Risk of Recurrence in Papillary Thyroid Carcinomas?\n# Abstract: Background: The morbidity of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is primarily related to locoregional recurrences and distant metastases. The definition of minimal extrathyroidal extension (mETE) has been recently revised. The presence of mETE does not impact mortality and is generally not considered to be a predictor for the risk of recurrence. This study aimed at comparing the risk of recurrence and the response to therapy of PTC with mETE and gross extrathyroidal extension (ETE) into the strap muscles (gETE) with low- and intermediate-risk PTC without ETE (low risk w/o ETE and intermediate risk w/o ETE, respectively) to further characterize the impact of ETE on outcomes. Methods: A total of 596 PTCs were analyzed according to the degree of ETE as well as other predictors of recurrence. Four groups of patients were compared, low risk w/o ETE (n = 251), intermediate risk w/o ETE (n = 89), mETE (n = 191), and gETE (n = 65), to determine the risk of recurrence and the response to treatment. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate associations between groups and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: The risk of recurrence was 3% in low risk w/o ETE PTC, 14% in intermediate risk w/o ETE, 14% in mETE, and 25% in gETE. The recurrence risk was increased by the presence of ETE (odds ratio [OR] = 2.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-5.85, p = 0.005) and lymph node metastases (OR = 2.44 [95% CI 1.25-4.76], p = 0.009). Patients with low-risk carcinomas w/o ETE experienced longer DFS than those with mETE (hazard ratio = 0.08 [95% CI 0.02-0.28], p < 0.001), but no significant difference was observed between intermediate risk w/o ETE, mETE, and gETE. In terms of the response to therapy, patients with gETE had higher rates of biochemical and/or structural incomplete responses within the first year of treatment (OR = 2.68 [95% CI 1.31-5.45], p = 0.007) and at the final follow-up evaluation (OR = 4.35 [95% CI 1.99-9.51], p < 0.001) compared with those with mETE. An analysis of the subgroups of microcarcinomas without lymph node metastases revealed no significant difference in DFS or the response to therapy between the low risk w/o ETE and mETE PTC groups. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that both mETE and gETE are independent risk factors for the risk of recurrence in PTC. Although gETE has a more pronounced impact on the recurrence risk and is associated with a worse response to therapy, mETE may not be associated with a low risk of recurrence. This observation suggests that patients with PTC and mETE may, in part, have an intermediate risk of recurrence and need to be followed accordingly."

A total of 80 patients with acute cerebral infarction who were treated at our hospital were randomly selected. They were divided into groups A and B. The two groups were treated with intravenous thrombolysis, while group B received sub-hypothermia treatment. Prior to treatment and at 7 days after treatment, 5 ml of venous blood was collected and stored in a freezer at -80˚C. IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 levels were detected by ELISA and compared between the groups and time-points. The results were as follows: i) At 7 days after treatment, the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in group B were significantly decreased compared with those in group A (P<0.05), while there was no significant difference of these levels between group A and B before treatment (P>0.05).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the determinants and consequences of surveillance completeness. Patients who underwent endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair between October 1996 and August 2004 and enrolled in the EUROSTAR registry were analyzed. Two groups were compared: patients who attended all scheduled visits (group A) and those who came infrequently (group B). Odds ratios and hazard rates (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined to detect which patient characteristics and complications were associated with follow-up intensity. Of the 4,433 patients, 1,538 (35%) attended all scheduled visits until the end of follow-up (group A). Analysis of patient characteristics demonstrated that intensive visitors were more often smokers, hyperlipemic, and considered unfit for open surgery or general anesthesia. Complications during follow-up, including endoleaks (24% vs. 20%), kinking (3.5% vs. 2.5%), and migration (4.9% vs. 3.5%), appeared significantly more frequently in group A. Despite intensive follow-up of this category, still a greater proportion died (12% vs. 9%, adjusted HR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.8). After 84 months of follow-up, the cumulative survival rates in groups A and B were 71% and 74%, respectively (p < 0.0001). It seems that follow-up intensity was based on baseline patient characteristics.

      "conclusionB": "**Primary Concluding Statement:**\n\nCurrent evidence indicates that while routine, frequent imaging surveillance (e.g., annually) for all patients after EVAR has not demonstrated a clear benefit in reducing overall reintervention rates compared to less frequent or symptom-driven approaches, appropriate surveillance tailored to individual patient risk is essential. The optimal strategy involves risk stratification based on factors including aneurysm characteristics, device type, and post-procedural findings, reserving more frequent imaging for high-risk patients or those with specific complications like persistent endoleaks or sac enlargement; symptom awareness remains crucial for all patients.\n"

Although these indicators have been applied widely for nursing home regulation, quality improvement, and public reporting, researchers and stakeholders have raised concerns about their accuracy and usefulness. We critically evaluate nursing home quality indicators from the standpoint of theory, measurement, and application, and we recommend strategies to make the indicators more valuable as quality assessment tools. We recommend that (a) more comprehensive quality indicators should be developed in conjunction with the new Minimum Data Set 3.0; (b) the validity and reliability of the indicators should be evaluated thoroughly with respect to both measurement and application; (c) statistical criteria should be incorporated explicitly into quality indicator scoring and outlier targeting; (d) the dimensionality and theoretical structure of the quality indicators should be carefully examined; (e) risk adjustment methods should be refined and broadened; and (f) quality indicator reporting systems should be strengthened and tailored to stakeholders' needs.",

      "# Title: Nutritional care; do process and structure indicators influence malnutrition prevalence over time?\n# Abstract: To date, no information is available about the effect of structural and process factors of nutritional care on the prevalence of malnutrition over time in the long-term care sector. This study analyzes the trend of malnutrition prevalence rates between 2007 and 2011 in the long-term care sector, and the related effects of(1) process indicators such as nutritional screening and treatment and 2) structural indicators (guideline, protocol or nutritional screening policy). From 2007 to 2011, the Dutch National Prevalence Measurement of Care Problems (LPZ) was performed in Dutch long-term care organizations using a standardized questionnaire involving measurements at institutional, ward and resident level. The data were analyzed by mixed-linear regression for longitudinal data. Presence of malnutrition was assessed by BMI, undesired weight loss and nutritional intake. Seventy-four care homes were included (26,101 residents). The malnutrition prevalence trend significantly decreased (P < 0.001) from 26% to 18% from 2007 to 2011. In the final model of the mixed effects analysis only the interacted process indicators nutritional screening and oral nutritional supplementation (ONS) were significant in influencing malnutrition prevalence rates over time. Structural indicators had no impact on the malnutrition prevalence over time. In conclusion, over time a lower prevalence of malnutrition is associated with a higher degree of nutritional screening. As might be expected, a higher prevalence of malnutrition is associated with higher use of ONS. Structural nutritional screening is an important intervention to tackle the problem of malnutrition in the long term care sector.",

      "# Title: Which characteristics of nursing home residents influence differences in malnutrition prevalence? An international comparison of The Netherlands, Germany and Austria.\n# Abstract: Prevalence rates of malnutrition vary considerably internationally, partly due to differences in measurement methodology and instruments. In the present study, the same measurement methodology and instruments were used in The Netherlands, Germany and Austria. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether resident characteristics influence possible differences in malnutrition prevalence between countries. The study followed a cross-sectional, multi-centre design that measured malnutrition in nursing home residents from The Netherlands, Germany and Austria. Resident data were gathered using a standardised questionnaire. Malnutrition was operationalised using BMI, unintentional weight loss and nutritional intake. Data were analysed using an association model. The prevalence rates of malnutrition in The Netherlands, Germany and Austria were 18·3, 20·1 and 22·5 %, respectively. The multivariate generalised estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression analysis showed that sex, age, care dependency, the mean number of diseases and some specific diseases were influencing factors for whether the resident was malnourished or not. The OR of malnutrition in the three countries declined after including the influencing factors resulting from the multivariate GEE analysis. The present study reveals that differences in the prevalence rates of malnutrition in nursing homes in The Netherlands, Germany and Austria are influenced by different resident characteristics. Since other country-related factors could also play an important role in influencing differences in the prevalence rates of malnutrition between the countries (structural and process factors of malnutrition care policy). We recommend the investigation of these factors in future studies.",

A randomized, single-blind study was performed to evaluate the effects of the combination of high-dose furosemide and small-volume hypertonic saline solution (HSS) infusion in the treatment of refractory New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV CHF and a normosodic diet during follow-up. Materials and Methods One hundred seven patients (39 women and 68 men, age range 65-90 years) with refractory CHF (NYHA class IV) of different etiologies, who were unresponsive to high oral doses of furosemide, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digitalis, and nitrates, were enrolled. Inclusion criteria included an ejection fraction (EF) <35%, serum creatinine level <2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level < or =60 mg/dL, reduced urinary volume, and low natriuresis. The patients were randomized in 2 groups (single-blind). Patients in group 1 (20 women and 33 men) received an intravenous (IV) infusion of furosemide (500-1000 mg) plus HSS (150 mL of 1.4%-4.6% NACl) twice a day in 30 minutes. Patients in group 2 (19 women and 35 men) received an IV bolus of furosemide (500-1000 mg) twice a day, without HSS, during a period lasting 6 to 12 days. Both groups received IV KCl (20-40 mEq) to prevent hypokalemia. At study entry, all patients underwent a physical examination and measurement of body weight (BW), blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR), an evaluation of signs of CHF, and measurement of control levels of serum Na, K, Cl, bicarbonate, albumin, uric acid, creatinine, urea, and glycemia daily during hospitalization, and measurements of the daily output of urine for Na, K, and Cl. A chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram were obtained at study entry, during hospitalization, and at the time of discharge from the hospital. During the treatment and after discharge, the daily dietary Na intake was 120 mmol in group 1 versus 80 mmol in group 2, with a fluid intake of 1000 mL daily in both groups. An assessment of BW and 24-hour urinary volume, serum, and urinary laboratory parameters were performed daily until patients reached a compensated state, when IV furosemide was replaced with oral administration (250-500 mg/d).

Sequence-influenced methylations were described in T2DM-associated genomic regions, but evidence for direct, sequence-independent association with disease risk is missing. Here, we explore disease-contributing DNA methylation through a stepwise study design: first, a pool-based, genome-scale screen among 1169 case and control individuals revealed an excess of differentially methylated sites in genomic regions that were previously associated with T2DM through genetic studies. Next, in-depth analyses were performed at selected top-ranking regions. A CpG site in the first intron of the FTO gene showed small (3.35%) but significant (P = 0.000021) hypomethylation of cases relative to controls. The effect was independent of the sequence polymorphism in the region and persists among individuals carrying the sequence-risk alleles. The odds of belonging to the T2DM group increased by 6.1% for every 1% decrease in methylation (OR = 1.061, 95% CI: 1.032-1.090), the odds ratio for decrease of 1 standard deviation of methylation (adjusted to gender) was 1.5856 (95% CI: 1.2824-1.9606) and the sensitivity (area under the curve = 0.638, 95% CI: 0.586-0.690; males = 0.675, females = 0.609) was better than that of the strongest known sequence variant. Furthermore, a prospective study in an independent population cohort revealed significant hypomethylation of young individuals that later progressed to T2DM, relative to the individuals who stayed healthy. Further genomic analysis revealed co-localization with gene enhancers and with binding sites for methylation-sensitive transcriptional regulators. The data showed that low methylation level at the analyzed sites is an early marker of T2DM and suggests a novel mechanism by which early-onset, inter-individual methylation variation at isolated non-promoter genomic sites predisposes to T2DM.",
      "# Title: DNA methylation profiling identifies epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetic patients.\n# Abstract: In addition to genetic predisposition, environmental and lifestyle factors contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Epigenetic changes may provide the link for translating environmental exposures into pathological mechanisms. In this study, we performed the first comprehensive DNA methylation profiling in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We uncovered 276 CpG loci affiliated to promoters of 254 genes displaying significant differential DNA methylation in diabetic islets. These methylation changes were not present in blood cells from T2D individuals nor were they experimentally induced in non-diabetic islets by exposure to high glucose. For a subgroup of the differentially methylated genes, concordant transcriptional changes were present. Functional annotation of the aberrantly methylated genes and RNAi experiments highlighted pathways implicated in β-cell survival and function; some are implicated in cellular dysfunction while others facilitate adaptation to stressors. Together, our findings offer new insights into the intricate mechanisms of T2D pathogenesis, underscore the important involvement of epigenetic dysregulation in diabetic islets and may advance our understanding of T2D aetiology.",

      "# Title: Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of human pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic donors identifies candidate genes that influence insulin secretion.\n# Abstract: Impaired insulin secretion is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Epigenetics may affect disease susceptibility. To describe the human methylome in pancreatic islets and determine the epigenetic basis of T2D, we analyzed DNA methylation of 479,927 CpG sites and the transcriptome in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We provide a detailed map of the global DNA methylation pattern in human islets, β- and α-cells. Genomic regions close to the transcription start site showed low degrees of methylation and regions further away from the transcription start site such as the gene body, 3'UTR and intergenic regions showed a higher degree of methylation. While CpG islands were hypomethylated, the surrounding 2 kb shores showed an intermediate degree of methylation, whereas regions further away (shelves and open sea) were hypermethylated in human islets, β- and α-cells. We identified 1,649 CpG sites and 853 genes, including TCF7L2, FTO and KCNQ1, with differential DNA methylation in T2D islets after correction for multiple testing. The majority of the differentially methylated CpG sites had an intermediate degree of methylation and were underrepresented in CpG islands (∼ 7%) and overrepresented in the open sea (∼ 60%). 102 of the differentially methylated genes, including CDKN1A, PDE7B, SEPT9 and EXOC3L2, were differentially expressed in T2D islets. Methylation of CDKN1A and PDE7B promoters in vitro suppressed their transcriptional activity. Functional analyses demonstrated that identified candidate genes affect pancreatic β- and α-cells as Exoc3l silencing reduced exocytosis and overexpression of Cdkn1a, Pde7b and Sept9 perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion in clonal β- and α-cells, respectively. Together, our data can serve as a reference methylome in human islets. We provide new target genes with altered DNA methylation and expression in human T2D islets that contribute to perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion. These results highlight the importance of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of T2D.",
      "# Title: Altered DNA methylation and differential expression of genes influencing metabolism and inflammation in adipose tissue from subjects with type 2 diabetes.\n# Abstract: Genetics, epigenetics, and environment may together affect the susceptibility for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our aim was to dissect molecular mechanisms underlying T2D using genome-wide expression and DNA methylation data in adipose tissue from monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D and independent case-control cohorts. In adipose tissue from diabetic twins, we found decreased expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation; carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism; and increased expression of genes involved in inflammation and glycan degradation. The most differentially expressed genes included ELOVL6, GYS2, FADS1, SPP1 (OPN), CCL18, and IL1RN. We replicated these results in adipose tissue from an independent case-control cohort. Several candidate genes for obesity and T2D (e.g., IRS1 and VEGFA) were differentially expressed in discordant twins. We found a heritable contribution to the genome-wide DNA methylation variability in twins. Differences in methylation between monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D were subsequently modest. However, 15,627 sites, representing 7,046 genes including PPARG, KCNQ1, TCF7L2, and IRS1, showed differential DNA methylation in adipose tissue from unrelated subjects with T2D compared with control subjects. A total of 1,410 of these sites also showed differential DNA methylation in the twins discordant for T2D. For the differentially methylated sites, the heritability estimate was 0.28. We also identified copy number variants (CNVs) in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D. Taken together, subjects with T2D exhibit multiple transcriptional and epigenetic changes in adipose tissue relevant to the development of the disease.",
      "# Title: An integrated epigenomic analysis for type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci in monozygotic twins.\n# Abstract: DNA methylation has a great potential for understanding the aetiology of common complex traits such as Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here we perform genome-wide methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) in whole-blood-derived DNA from 27 monozygotic twin pairs and follow up results with replication and integrated omics analyses. We identify predominately hypermethylated T2D-related differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and replicate the top signals in 42 unrelated T2D cases and 221 controls. The strongest signal is in the promoter of the MALT1 gene, involved in insulin and glycaemic pathways, and related to taurocholate levels in blood. Integrating the DNA methylome findings with T2D GWAS meta-analysis results reveals a strong enrichment for DMRs in T2D-susceptibility loci. We also detect signals specific to T2D-discordant twins in the GPR61 and PRKCB genes. These replicated T2D associations reflect both likely causal and consequential pathways of the disease. The analysis indicates how an integrated genomics and epigenomics approach, utilizing an MZ twin design, can provide pathogenic insights as well as potential drug targets and biomarkers for T2D and other complex traits.",

      "# Title: Novel epigenetic determinants of type 2 diabetes in Mexican-American families.\n# Abstract: Although DNA methylation is now recognized as an important mediator of complex diseases, the extent to which the genetic basis of such diseases is accounted for by DNA methylation is unknown. In the setting of large, extended families representing a minority, high-risk population of the USA, we aimed to characterize the role of epigenome-wide DNA methylation in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Using Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays, we tested for association of DNA methylation at 446 356 sites with age, sex and phenotypic traits related to T2D in 850 pedigreed Mexican-American individuals. Robust statistical analyses showed that (i) 15% of the methylome is significantly heritable, with a median heritability of 0.14; (ii) DNA methylation at 14% of CpG sites is associated with nearby sequence variants; (iii) 22% and 3% of the autosomal CpG sites are associated with age and sex, respectively; (iv) 53 CpG sites were significantly associated with liability to T2D, fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance; (v) DNA methylation levels at five CpG sites, mapping to three well-characterized genes (TXNIP, ABCG1 and SAMD12) independently explained 7.8% of the heritability of T2D (vi) methylation at these five sites was unlikely to be influenced by neighboring DNA sequence variation. Our study has identified novel epigenetic indicators of T2D risk in Mexican Americans who have increased risk for this disease. These results provide new insights into potential treatment targets of T2D.",

      "# Title: Epigenome-wide association study identifies TXNIP gene associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and sustained hyperglycemia.\n# Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is an established risk factor for a wide range of vascular diseases, including ischemic stroke (IS). Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a marker for average blood glucose levels over the previous 12 weeks, is used as a measure of glycemic control and also as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes (HbA1c levels ≥ 6.5%). Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, may be associated with aging processes and with modulation of the risk of various pathologies, such as DM. Specifically, DNA methylation could be one of the mechanisms mediating the relation between DM and environmental exposures. Our goal was to identify new CpG methylation sites associated with DM. We performed a genome-wide methylation study in whole-blood DNA from an IS patient cohorts. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array was used to measure DNA methylation in CpG sites. All statistical analyses were adjusted for sex, age, hyperlipidemia, body mass index (BMI), smoking habit and cell count. Findings were replicated in two independent cohorts, an IS cohort and a population-based cohort, using the same array. In the discovery phase (N = 355), we identified a CpG site, cg19693031 (located in the TXNIP gene) that was associated with DM (P = 1.17 × 10(-12)); this CpG was replicated in two independent cohorts (N = 167 and N = 645). Methylation of TXNIP was inversely and intensely associated with HbA1c levels (P = 7.3 × 10(-16)), specifically related to diabetic patients with poor control of glucose levels. We identified an association between the TXNIP gene and DM through epigenetic mechanisms, related to sustained hyperglycemia levels (HbA1c ≥ 7%).",

Here we examine whether age-related epigenetic changes affect human islet function and if blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect these changes and associate with future T2D. We analyse DNA methylation genome-wide in islets from 87 non-diabetic donors, aged 26-74 years. Aging associates with increased DNA methylation of 241 sites. These sites cover loci previously associated with T2D, for example, KLF14. Blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related methylation changes in 83 genes identified in human islets (for example, KLF14, FHL2, ZNF518B and FAM123C) and some associate with insulin secretion and T2D. DNA methylation correlates with islet expression of multiple genes, including FHL2, ZNF518B, GNPNAT1 and HLTF. Silencing these genes in β-cells alter insulin secretion. Together, we demonstrate that blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related DNA methylation changes in human islets, and associate with insulin secretion in vivo and T2D.",
      "# Title: Genome-Wide DNA Methylation in Mixed Ancestry Individuals with Diabetes and Prediabetes from South Africa.\n# Abstract: Aims. To conduct a genome-wide DNA methylation in individuals with type 2 diabetes, individuals with prediabetes, and control mixed ancestry individuals from South Africa. Methods. We used peripheral blood to perform genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in 3 individuals with screen detected diabetes, 3 individuals with prediabetes, and 3 individuals with normoglycaemia from the Bellville South Community, Cape Town, South Africa, who were age-, gender-, body mass index-, and duration of residency-matched. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) was performed by Arraystar Inc. (Rockville, MD, USA). Results. Hypermethylated DMRs were 1160 (81.97%) and 124 (43.20%), respectively, in individuals with diabetes and prediabetes when both were compared to subjects with normoglycaemia. Our data shows that genes related to the immune system, signal transduction, glucose transport, and pancreas development have altered DNA methylation in subjects with prediabetes and diabetes. Pathway analysis based on the functional analysis mapping of genes to KEGG pathways suggested that the linoleic acid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism pathways are hypomethylated in prediabetes and diabetes. Conclusions. Our study suggests that epigenetic changes are likely to be an early process that occurs before the onset of overt diabetes. Detailed analysis of DMRs that shows gradual methylation differences from control versus prediabetes to prediabetes versus diabetes in a larger sample size is required to confirm these findings.",
      "# Title: Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing of Human Pancreatic Islets Reveals Novel Differentially Methylated Regions in Type 2 Diabetes Pathogenesis.\n# Abstract: Current knowledge about the role of epigenetics in type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains limited. Only a few studies have investigated DNA methylation of selected candidate genes or a very small fraction of genomic CpG sites in human pancreatic islets, the tissue of primary pathogenic importance for diabetes. Our aim was to characterize the whole-genome DNA methylation landscape in human pancreatic islets, to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in diabetic islets, and to investigate the function of DMRs in islet biology. Here, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, which is a comprehensive and unbiased method to study DNA methylation throughout the genome at a single nucleotide resolution, in pancreatic islets from donors with T2D and control subjects without diabetes. We identified 25,820 DMRs in islets from individuals with T2D. These DMRs cover loci with known islet function, e.g., PDX1, TCF7L2, and ADCY5 Importantly, binding sites previously identified by ChIP-seq for islet-specific transcription factors, enhancer regions, and different histone marks were enriched in the T2D-associated DMRs. We also identified 457 genes, including NR4A3, PARK2, PID1, SLC2A2, and SOCS2, that had both DMRs and significant expression changes in T2D islets. To mimic the situation in T2D islets, candidate genes were overexpressed or silenced in cultured β-cells. This resulted in impaired insulin secretion, thereby connecting differential methylation to islet dysfunction. We further explored the islet methylome and found a strong link between methylation levels and histone marks. Additionally, DNA methylation in different genomic regions and of different transcript types (i.e., protein coding, noncoding, and pseudogenes) was associated with islet expression levels. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the islet DNA methylome in individuals with and without diabetes and highlights the importance of epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets and T2D pathogenesis."

      "# Title: The modified frailty index and 30-day adverse events in oncologic neurosurgery.\n# Abstract: The modified frailty index (mFI) is emerging as a leading measure for preoperative risk assessment using routinely available medical record data. Our objective was to determine if mFI predicts morbidity and mortality in the diverse national cohort of patients undergoing neurosurgery for intracranial neoplasms. We identified patients in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program who underwent oncologic neurosurgery procedures between 2008 and 2012. The mFI, ranging from 0 to 1, was calculated as the proportion of 11 possible risk factors present. We assessed the associations between mFI and 30-day mortality, neurologic and medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge in univariate and multivariable analyses and compare the index to established risk stratification techniques. A total of 9149 patients were identified. Mortality, severe medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge increased incrementally with increasing levels of frailty. Severe neurologic complications were highest in those with low frailty. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, increased frailty increased the odds of all adverse outcomes, including neurologic complications. The mFI increased the ability to predict all outcomes beyond available indices and was the most reliable predictor of neurologic complications. The mFI can be calculated from routinely collected medical record data and is predictive of 30-day adverse outcomes in a wide variety of neurosurgical oncology patients. The index may be a useful component of preoperative risk assessment with implications for shared decision-making, perioperative planning, and risk adjusted outcomes measurement in national quality registries.",

Few data exist regarding the relationship of frailty with adverse outcomes in craniotomy for brain tumor resection. We assessed the relationship between frailty and the incidence of major post-operative complication, discharge destination other than home, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality after elective craniotomy for brain tumor resection. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 20,333 adult patients undergoing elective craniotomy for tumor resection in the 2012-2018 ACS-NSQIP Participant Use File. Multivariate logistic regression was performed using all covariates deemed eligible through clinical and statistical significance. 6,249 patients (30.7%) were low-frailty and 2,148 patients (10.6%) were medium-to-high frailty. In multivariate logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, BMI, ASA classification, smoking status, dyspnea, significant pre-operative weight loss, chronic steroid use, bleeding disorder, tumor type, and operative time, low frailty was associated with increased adjusted odds ratio of major complication (1.41, 95% CI: 1.23-1.60, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.32, 95% CI: 1.20-1.46, p < 0.001), 30-day readmission (1.29, 95% CI: 1.15-1.44, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (1.87, 95% CI: 1.41-2.47, p < 0.001). Moderate-to-high frailty was also associated with increased adjusted odds of major complication (1.61, 95% CI: 1.35-1.92, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.80, 95% CI: 1.58-2.05), 30-day readmission (1.39, 95% CI: 1.19-1.62, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (2.42, 95% CI: 1.74-3.38, p < 0.001).

Previously, we synthesized a 9-arginine-based reducible high molecular weight peptide for gene delivery. For the reducible poly(oligo-D-arginines) (rPOA), 9-arginine oligopeptides are connected by internal disulfide linkages to produce a high molecular weight peptide. In this study, rPOA was evaluated as a carrier of the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene for the treatment of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) -induced brain stroke. An in vitro transfection assay showed that rPOA had higher transfection efficiency and lower toxicity than polyethylenimine (PEI). For in vivo evaluation, I/R rat models were produced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). rPOA/HO-1 expression plasmid (pHO-1) polyplexes were injected into the brain at 1 h before MCAO, and HO-1 expression levels in the brain were then measured by ELISA. The results indicated that rPOA/pHO-1 polyplexes had higher transfection efficiencies than PEI/pHO-1 polyplexes. The rPOA/pHO-1 polyplexes significantly reduced infarct volumes. In addition, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) was reduced in the rPOA/pHO-1 polyplex injection group, suggesting that HO-1 had an anti-inflammatory effect, while the PEI/pHO-1 polyplex did not show this effect. These results suggest that rPOA is a potential non-viral vector for HO-1 gene therapy to protect brain cells from I/R-related neuronal injury including stroke.",
      "# Title: Poly-arginine and arginine-rich peptides are neuroprotective in stroke models.\n# Abstract: Using cortical neuronal cultures and glutamic acid excitotoxicity and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) stroke models, we demonstrated that poly-arginine and arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), are highly neuroprotective, with efficacy increasing with increasing arginine content, have the capacity to reduce glutamic acid-induced neuronal calcium influx and require heparan sulfate preotoglycan-mediated endocytosis to induce a neuroprotective effect. Furthermore, neuroprotection could be induced with immediate peptide treatment or treatment up to 2 to 4 hours before glutamic acid excitotoxicity or OGD, and with poly-arginine-9 (R9) when administered intravenously after stroke onset in a rat model. In contrast, the JNKI-1 peptide when fused to the (non-arginine) kFGF CPP, which does not rely on endocytosis for uptake, was not neuroprotective in the glutamic acid model; the kFGF peptide was also ineffective. Similarly, positively charged poly-lysine-10 (K10) and R9 fused to the negatively charged poly-glutamic acid-9 (E9) peptide (R9/E9) displayed minimal neuroprotection after excitotoxicity. These results indicate that peptide positive charge and arginine residues are critical for neuroprotection, and have led us to hypothesize that peptide-induced endocytic internalization of ion channels is a potential mechanism of action. The findings also question the mode of action of different neuroprotective peptides fused to arginine-rich CPPs.",

      "# Title: The R18 Polyarginine Peptide Is More Effective Than the TAT-NR2B9c (NA-1) Peptide When Administered 60 Minutes after Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in the Rat.\n# Abstract: We examined the dose responsiveness of polyarginine R18 (100, 300, and 1000 nmol/kg) when administered 60 minutes after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The TAT-NR2B9c peptide, which is known to be neuroprotective in rodent and nonhuman primate stroke models, served as a positive control. At 24 hours after MCAO, there was reduced total infarct volume in R18 treated animals at all doses, but this reduction only reached statistical significance at doses of 100 and 1000 nmol/kg. The TAT-NR2B9c peptide reduced infarct volume at doses of 300 and 1000 nmol/kg, but not to a statistically significant extent, while the 100 nmol/kg dose was ineffective. The reduction in infarct volume with R18 and TAT-NR2B9c peptide treatments was mirrored by improvements in one or more functional outcomes (namely, neurological score, adhesive tape removal, and rota-rod), but not to a statistically significant extent. These findings further confirm the neuroprotective properties of polyarginine peptides and for R18 extend its therapeutic time window and dose range, as well as demonstrating its greater efficacy compared to TAT-NR2B9c in a severe stroke model. The superior neuroprotective efficacy of R18 over TAT-NR2B9c highlights the potential of this polyarginine peptide as a lead candidate for studies in human stroke.",

In addition, the presence of other amino acids within arginine-rich peptides, as well as chemical modifications, peptide length and cell-penetrating properties also influence the level of neuroprotection.

In vitro studies demonstrated that protamine and poly-arginine peptides (R12-c, R22) were neuroprotective. Arginine-tryptophan-containing peptides were highly neuroprotective, with R12W8a being the most potent arginine-rich peptide identified in our laboratory. Peptides containing phenylalanine or tyrosine substituted in place of tryptophan in R12W8a were also highly neuroprotective, whereas leucine, and in particular glycine substitutions, decreased peptide efficacy. In vivo studies with protamine administered intravenously at 1000 nmol/kg 30 min after MCAO significantly reduced infarct volume and cerebral oedema by 22.5 and 38.6%, respectively. The R12W8a peptide was highly toxic when administered intravenously at 300 or 100 nmol/kg and ineffective at reducing infarct volume when administered at 30 nmol/kg 30 min after MCAO, unlike R18 (30 nmol/kg), which significantly reduced infarct volume by 20.4%. However, both R12W8a and R18 significantly reduced cerebral oedema by 19.8 and 42.2%, respectively. Protamine, R12W8a and R18 also reduced neuronal glutamic acid-induced calcium influx. These findings further highlight the neuroprotective properties of arginine-rich peptides and support the view that they represent a new class of neuroprotective agent.",
      "# Title: Delayed 2-h post-stroke administration of R18 and NA-1 (TAT-NR2B9c) peptides after permanent and/or transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat.\n# Abstract: Following positive results with the poly-arginine peptide R18 when administered intravenously 30 or 60min after permanent and/or transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO; 90min) in the rat, we examined the effectiveness of the peptide when administered 2h after MCAO. R18 was administered intravenously (1000nmol/kg via jugular vein) after permanent MCAO or a transient 3-h MCAO or when administered intra-arterially (100nmol/kg via internal carotid artery) immediately after reperfusion following a transient 2-h MCAO. In the transient MCAO studies, the neuroprotective NA-1 peptide was used as a positive control. Infarct volume, cerebral edema and functional outcomes were measured 24h after MCAO. Following permanent or transient MCAO, neither R18 nor NA-1 significantly reduced infarct volume. However, following permanent MCAO, R18 appeared to reduce cerebral edema (p=0.006), whereas following a transient 3-h MCAO, R18 improved the time to remove adhesive tape (p=0.04) without significantly affecting cerebral edema. There was also a trend (p=0.07) towards improved rota-rod performance with R18 in both permanent and transient 3-h MCAO. Following a transient 2-h MCAO, R18 had no significant effects on cerebral edema or neurological score but did lessen the extent of weight loss. Overall, while R18 had no effect on infarct volume, the peptide reduced cerebral edema after permanent MCAO, and improved some functional outcomes after transient MCAO.",
      "# Title: Warburg effect hypothesis in autism Spectrum disorders.\n# Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disease which is characterized by a deficit in social interactions and communication with repetitive and restrictive behavior. In altered cells, metabolic enzymes are modified by the dysregulation of the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway. In ASD, the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway is upregulated. We focus this review on the hypothesis of Warburg effect stimulated by the overexpression of the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway in ASD. Upregulation of WNT/β-catenin pathway induces aerobic glycolysis, named Warburg effect, through activation of glucose transporter (Glut), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1(PDK1), monocarboxylate lactate transporter 1 (MCT-1), lactate dehydrogenase kinase-A (LDH-A) and inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH). The aerobic glycolysis consists to a supply of a large part of glucose into lactate regardless of oxygen. Aerobic glycolysis is less efficient in terms of ATP production than oxidative phosphorylation because of the shunt of the TCA cycle. Dysregulation of energetic metabolism might promote cell deregulation and progression of ASD. Warburg effect regulation could be an attractive target for developing therapeutic interventions in ASD.",
      "# Title: Comparison of neuroprotective efficacy of poly-arginine R18 and R18D (D-enantiomer) peptides following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in the Wistar rat and in vitro toxicity studies.\n# Abstract: We have previously demonstrated that arginine-rich and poly-arginine peptides possess potent neuroprotective properties, with poly-arginine peptide R18 identified as being highly effective at reducing infarct volume following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the Sprague Dawley rat. Since peptides synthesised using D-isoform amino acids have greater stability than L-isoform peptides due to increased resistance to proteolytic degradation, they represent potentially more effective peptide therapeutics. Therefore we compared the neuroprotective efficacy of R18 and its D-enantiomer R18D following permanent MCAO in the Wistar rat. Furthermore, as increased peptide stability may also increase peptide toxicity, we examined the effects of R18 and R18D on cultured cortical neurons, astrocytes, brain endothelial cells (bEND.3), and embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) following a 10-minute or 24-hour peptide exposure duration. The in vivo studies demonstrated that R18D resulted in a greater reduction in mean infarct volume compared to R18 (33%, p = 0.004 vs 12%, p = 0.27) after intravenous administration at 300 nmol/kg 30 minutes after MCAO. Both R18D and R18 reduced cerebral hemisphere swelling to a comparable degree (27%, p = 0.03 and 30%, p = 0.02), and improved neurological assessment scores (1.5, p = 0.02 and 2, p = 0.058 vs 3 for vehicle). No abnormal histological findings specific to peptide treatments were observed in hematoxylin and eosin stained sections of kidney, liver, spleen, lung and heart. In vitro studies demonstrated that R18 and R18D were most toxic to neurons, followed by astrocytes, HEK293 and bEND.3 cells, but only at high concentrations and/or following 24-hour exposure. These findings further highlight the neuroprotective properties of poly-arginine peptides, and indicate that R18D at the dose examined is more potent than R18 in Wistar rats, and justify continued investigation of the R18 peptide as a novel neuroprotective agent for stroke.",
      "# Title: Assessment of therapeutic window for poly-arginine-18D (R18D) in a P7 rat model of perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy.\n# Abstract: Hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) remains the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in neonates, with no available neuroprotective therapeutic agent. In the development of a therapeutic for HIE, we examined the neuroprotective efficacy of the poly-arginine peptide R18D (arginine 18 mer synthesised with D-arginine) in a perinatal model of hypoxia-ischaemia (HI; common carotid and external carotid occlusion + 8%O2 /92%N2 for 2.5 hr) in the P7 Sprague-Dawley rat. R18D was administered intraperitoneally 30 min (doses 10, 30, 100, 300 and 1,000 nmol/kg), 60 min (doses 30 and 300 nmol/kg) or 120 min (doses 30 and 300 nmol/kg) after HI. Infarct volumes and behavioural outcomes were measured 48 hr after HI. When administered 30 min after HI, R18D at varying doses reduced infarct volume by 23.7% to 35.6% (p = 0.009 to < 0.0001) and resulted in improvements in the negative geotactic response and wire-hang times, at a dose of 30 nmol/kg. When administered 60 min after HI, R18D at the 30 nmol/kg dose reduced total infarct volume by 34.2% (p = 0.002), whilst the 300 nmol/kg dose improved wire-hang time. When administered 120 min after HI, R18D at the 30 and 300 nmol/kg doses had no significant impact on infarct volume, but the 300 nmol/kg dose improved the negative geotactic response. This study further confirms the neuroprotective properties of poly-arginine peptides, demonstrating that R18D can reduce infarct volume and improve behavioural outcomes after HI if administered up to 60 min after HI and improve behavioural outcomes up to 2 hr after HI.",
      "# Title: Poly-Arginine Peptides R18 and R18D Improve Functional Outcomes After Endothelin-1-Induced Stroke in the Sprague Dawley Rat.\n# Abstract: We have previously demonstrated that R18 and its d-enantiomer, R18D, are neuroprotective at 24 hours following intraluminal filament occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) in the rat. This study examined R18 and R18D effectiveness in improving functional outcomes at up to 56 days poststroke following endothelin-1-induced MCAO. Peptides were administered intravenously at doses of 100, 300, or 1000 nmol/kg, 60 minutes after MCAO. Functional recovery poststroke was assessed using multiple forelimb placing tests and horizontal ladder test, and NA-1 (TAT-NR2B9c), a neuroprotective currently in phase 3 clinical stroke trials, was used as a benchmark. The study demonstrated that R18 (300 and 1000 nmol/kg) was the most effective peptide in improving functional outcomes, followed by R18D (300 and 1000 nmol/kg), and NA-1 (300 and 100 nmol/kg). Furthermore, R18 at doses of 300 and 1000 nmol/kg was the most effective agent in restoring pre-stroke body weight, while R18 and R18D at doses of 300 and 1000 nmol/kg, but not NA-1 also significantly reduced the number of animals requiring hand feeding 48 hours after stroke. This study confirms that R18 and R18D are effective in improving long-term functional outcomes after stroke, and suggests that R18 may be more effective than NA-1.",
      "# Title: Comparative Assessment of the Proteolytic Stability and Impact of Poly-Arginine Peptides R18 and R18D on Infarct Growth and Penumbral Tissue Preservation Following Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in the Sprague Dawley Rat.\n# Abstract: Poly-arginine peptides R18 and R18D have previously been demonstrated to be neuroprotective in ischaemic stroke models. Here we examined the proteolytic stability and efficacy of R18 and R18D in reducing infarct core growth and preserving the ischaemic penumbra following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the Sprague Dawley rat. R18 (300 or 1000 nmol/kg), R18D (300 nmol/kg) or saline were administered intravenously 10 min after MCAO induced using a filament. Serial perfusion and diffusion-weighted MRI imaging was performed to measure changes in the infarct core and penumbra from time points between 45- and 225-min post-occlusion. Repeated measures analyses of infarct growth and penumbral tissue size were evaluated using generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs). R18D (300 nmol/kg) was most effective in slowing infarct core growth (46.8 mm3 reduction; p < 0.001) and preserving penumbral tissue (21.6% increase; p < 0.001), followed by R18 at the 300 nmol/kg dose (core: 29.5 mm3 reduction; p < 0.001, penumbra: 12.5% increase; p < 0.001). R18 at the 1000 nmol/kg dose had a significant impact in slowing core growth (19.5 mm3 reduction; p = 0.026), but only a modest impact on penumbral preservation (6.9% increase; p = 0.062). The in vitro anti-excitotoxic neuroprotective efficacy of R18D was also demonstrated to be unaffected when preincubated for 1-3 h or overnight, in a cell lysate prepared from dying neurons or with the proteolytic enzyme, plasmin, whereas the neuroprotective efficacy of R18 was significantly reduced after a 2-h incubation. These findings highlight the capacity of poly-arginine peptides to reduce infarct growth and preserve the ischaemic penumbra, and confirm the superior efficacy and proteolytic stability of R18D, which indicates that this peptide is likely to retain its neuroprotective properties when co-administered with alteplase during thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke."

      "# Title: Expression of a hepatitis A virus antigen in Lactococcus lactis and Escherichia coli and evaluation of its immunogenicity.\n# Abstract: An epidemic shift in Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection has been observed in recent years in rapidly developing countries, with increasing numbers of severe adult cases which has led to renewed interest in vaccination. Our approach in vaccine development uses recombinant expression of the highly immunogenic HAV antigen VP1-P2a in food-grade lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis and in Escherichia coli. We used genetic constructs that enable nisin-controlled expression of the antigen in L. lactis in three different forms: (a) intracellularly, (b) on the bacterial surface and (c) on the bacterial surface fused with the fragment of the E. coli flagellin molecule that can act as a molecular adjuvant. Expression of the two surface forms of the antigen was achieved in L. lactis, and the resulting antigen-displaying bacteria were administered orally to mice. Half the animals in each of the two groups developed specific IgGs, with titers increasing over time and reaching 1:422 without flagellin and 1:320 with flagellin. A much higher titer 1:25,803 was observed with the parenterally administered antigen, which was purified from E. coli. With the latter, a significant mucosal IgA response was also observed. Despite significant titers, the IgGs elicited with oral or parenteral administration could not prevent HAV from infecting cells in a virus neutralization assay, suggesting that the antibodies cannot recognize viral surface epitopes. Nevertheless, orally administered HAV antigen expressed in L. lactis elicited significant systemic humoral immune response showing the feasibility for development of effective HAV vaccine for mucosal delivery.",
      "# Title: Oral immunization with recombinant Lactococcus lactis delivering a multi-epitope antigen CTB-UE attenuates Helicobacter pylori infection in mice.\n# Abstract: Urease is an essential virulence factor and colonization factor for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and is considered as an excellent vaccine candidate antigen. However, conventional technologies for preparing an injectable vaccine require purification of the antigenic protein and preparation of an adjuvant. Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 (L. lactis) could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of edible vaccine. In previous study, we constructed a multi-epitope vaccine, designated CTB-UE, which is composed of the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), three Th cell epitopes and two B-cell epitopes from urease subunits. To develop a novel type of oral vaccine against H. pylori, genetically modified L. lactis strains were established to secrete this epitope vaccine extracellularly in this study. Oral prophylactic immunization with recombinant L. lactis significantly elicited humoral anti-urease antibody responses (P < 0.001) and reduced the gastric colonization of H. pylori from 7.14 ± 0.95 to 4.68 ± 0.98 log10 CFU g(-1) stomach. This L. lactis oral vaccine offers a promising vaccine candidate for the control of H. pylori infection.",
      "# Title: Development of a new DNA vaccine based on mycobacterial ESAT-6 antigen delivered by recombinant invasive Lactococcus lactis FnBPA+.\n# Abstract: The use of the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis as a vehicle for the oral delivery of DNA vaccine plasmids constitutes a promising strategy for vaccination. The delivery of DNA plasmids into eukaryotic cells is of critical importance for subsequent DNA expression and effectiveness of the vaccine. In this context, the use of the recombinant invasive L. lactis FnBPA+ (fibronectin-binding protein A) strain for the oral delivery of the eukaryotic expression vector vaccination using lactic acid bacteria (pValac), coding for the 6-kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6) gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, could represent a new DNA vaccine strategy against tuberculosis. To this end, the ESAT-6 sequence was cloned into the pValac vector; the L. lactis fibronectin-binding protein A (FnBPA)+ (pValac:ESAT-6) strain was obtained, and its immunological profile was checked in BALB/c mice. This strain was able to significantly increase interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production in spleen cells, showing a systemic T helper 1 (Th1) cell response. The mice also showed a significant increase in specific secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) production in colon tissue and fecal extracts. Thus, this is the first time that L. lactis has been used to deliver a plasmid DNA harboring a gene that encodes an antigen against tuberculosis through mucous membranes.",
      "# Title: Lactococcus lactis displayed neuraminidase confers cross protective immunity against influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Influenza A viruses pose a serious threat to public health. Current influenza A vaccines predominantly focus on hemagglutinin (HA) and show strain-specific protection. Neuraminidase (NA) is much less studied in the context of humoral immunity against influenza A viruses. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cross protective immunity of NA presented on Lactococcus lactis (L.lactis) surface against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in the mouse model. L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA was constructed in which pgsA was used as an anchor protein. Mice vaccinated orally with L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA could elicit significant NA-specific serum IgG and mucosa IgA antibodies, as well as neuraminidase inhibition (NI) titers. Importantly, L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA provided 80% protection against H5N1, 60% protection against H3N2 and H1N1, respectively. These findings suggest that recombinant L.lactis/pNZ110-pgsA-NA in the absence of adjuvant via oral administration can be served as an effective vaccine candidate against diverse strains of influenza A viruses.",
      "# Title: Broadly protective immunity against divergent influenza viruses by oral co-administration of Lactococcus lactis expressing nucleoprotein adjuvanted with cholera toxin B subunit in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines need to be annually reformulated to well match the predicated circulating strains. Thus, it is critical for developing a novel universal influenza vaccine that would be able to confer cross-protection against constantly emerging divergent influenza virus strains. Influenza virus A is a genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses. Influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) is a structural protein which encapsidates the negative strand viral RNA, and anti-NP antibodies play role in cross-protective immunity. Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) is an ideal vaccine delivery vehicle via oral administration route. However, L. lactis vectored vaccine exhibits poor immunogenicity without the use of mucosal adjuvant. To enhance the immunogenicity of L. lactis vectored vaccine, cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit, one of mucosal adjuvants, is a safe adjuvant for oral route, when combined with L. lactis vectored vaccine. In this study, we hypothesized that pNZ8008, a L. lactis expression plasmid, encoding NP antigen, would be able to elicit cross-protection with the use of CTB via oral administration route.",
      "# Title: Cross-protection of Lactococcus lactis-displayed HA2 subunit against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines provide strain-specific protection against homologous subtypes and need to be updated annually. Therefore, it is essential to develop a universal vaccine that would induce broadly cross-protective immunity against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses. The highly conserved HA2 subunit is a promising candidate for developing a universal influenza vaccine. Here, we hypothesized that the HA2 subunit could be displayed on the surface of Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis), using Spax as an anchor protein (L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2) and that L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 would have immunogenicity by oral administration without the use of adjuvant in the mouse model. To address this hypothesis, we show that oral vaccination of mice with L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 elicited significant humoral and mucosal immune responses. Importantly, L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 provided 100% protection against homologous H5N1 or heterologous H1N1 virus challenge. These results suggest that an HA2 subunit presented on the surface of L. lactis is an effective universal vaccine candidate against influenza A viruses in the poultry industry and in humans.",
      "# Title: Oral Immunization with a Recombinant Lactococcus lactis-Expressing HIV-1 Antigen on Group A Streptococcus Pilus Induces Strong Mucosal Immunity in the Gut.\n# Abstract: The induction of a potent humoral and cellular immune response in mucosal tissue is important for the development of an effective HIV vaccine. Most of the current HIV vaccines under development use the i.m. route for immunization, which is relatively poor in generating potent and long-lived mucosal immune responses. In this article, we explore the ability of an oral vaccination with a probiotic organism, Lactococcus lactis, to elicit HIV-specific immune responses in the mucosal and systemic compartments of BALB/c mice. We expressed the HIV-1 Gag-p24 on the tip of the T3 pilus of Streptococcus pyogenes as a fusion to the Cpa protein (LL-Gag). After four monthly LL-Gag oral immunizations, we observed strong Gag-specific IgG and IgA responses in serum, feces, and vaginal secretions. However, the Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses in the blood were at or below our detection limit. After an i.m. modified vaccinia Ankara/Gag boost, we observed robust Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses both in systemic and in mucosal tissues, including intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes of the small intestine, Peyer's patches, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Consistent with strong immunogenicity, the LL-Gag induced activation of CD11c(+) CD11b(+) dendritic cells in the Peyer's patches after oral immunization. Our results demonstrate that oral immunization with L. lactis expressing an Ag on the tip of the group A Streptococcus pilus serves as an excellent vaccine platform to induce strong mucosal humoral and cellular immunity against HIV.",

      "# Title: Production and delivery of Helicobacter pylori NapA in Lactococcus lactis and its protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity.\n# Abstract: Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein A subunit (NapA) has been identified as a virulence factor, a protective antigen and a potent immunomodulator. NapA shows unique application potentials for anti-H. pylori vaccines and treatment strategies of certain allergic diseases and carcinomas. However, appropriate production and utilization modes of NapA still remain uncertain to date. This work has established a novel efficient production and utilization mode of NapA by using L. lactis as an expression host and delivery vector, and demonstrated immune protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity of the engineered L. lactis by oral vaccination of mice. It was observed for the first time that H. pylori NapA promotes both polarized Th17 and Th1 responses, which may greatly affect the clinical application of NapA. This report offers a promising anti-H. pylori oral vaccine candidate and a potent mucosal immune modulatory agent. Meanwhile, it uncovers a way to produce and deliver the oral vaccine and immunomodulator by fermentation of food like milk, which might have striking effects on control of H. pylori infection, gastrointestinal cancers, and Th2 bias allergic diseases, including many food allergies.",
      "# Title: Protective immunity induced by an intranasal multivalent vaccine comprising 10 Lactococcus lactis strains expressing highly prevalent M-protein antigens derived from Group A Streptococcus.\n# Abstract: Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) causes diseases ranging from mild pharyngitis to severe invasive infections. The N-terminal fragment of streptococcal M protein elicits protective antibodies and is an attractive vaccine target. However, this N- terminal fragment is hypervariable: there are more than 200 different M types. In this study, an intranasal live bacterial vaccine comprising 10 strains of Lactococcus lactis, each expressing one N-terminal fragment of M protein, has been developed. Live bacterial-vectored vaccines cost less to manufacture because the processes involved are less complex than those required for production of protein subunit vaccines. Moreover, intranasal administration does not require syringes or specialized personnel. Evaluation of individual vaccine types (M1, M2, M3, M4, M6, M9, M12, M22, M28 and M77) showed that most of them protected mice against challenge with virulent S. pyogenes. All 10 strains combined in a 10-valent vaccine (M×10) induced serum and bronchoalveolar lavage IgG titers that ranged from three- to 10-fold those of unimmunized mice. After intranasal challenge with M28 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice was significantly higher than that of unimmunized mice. In contrast, when mice were challenged with M75 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice did not differ significantly from that of unimmunized mice. Mx-10 immunized mice had significantly less S. pyogenes in oropharyngeal washes and developed less severe disease symptoms after challenge than did unimmunized mice. Our L. lactis-based vaccine may provide an alternative solution to development of broadly protective group A streptococcal vaccines.",
      "# Title: Mucosal and systemic immune responses elicited by recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a fusion protein composed of pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin from Bordetella pertussis.\n# Abstract: We constructed a food-grade expression system harboring a F1S1 fusion protein of Bordetella pertussis to be produced in Lactococcus lactis NZ3900 as a new oral vaccine model against whooping cough, caused by B. pertussis. F1S1 was composed of N-terminally truncated S1 subunit of pertussis toxin and type I immunodominant domain of filamentous hemagglutinin which are both known as protective immunogens against pertussis. The recombinant L. lactis was administered via oral or intranasal routes to BALB/c mice and the related specific systemic and mucosal immune responses were then evaluated. The results indicated significantly higher levels of specific IgA in the lung extracts and IgG in sera of mucosally-immunized mice, compared to their controls. It was revealed that higher levels of IgG2a, compared to IgG1, were produced in all mucosally-immunized mice. Moreover, immunized mice developed Th1 responses with high levels of IFN-γ production by the spleen cells. These findings provide evidence for L. lactis to be used as a suitable vehicle for expression and delivery of F1S1 fusion protein to mucosa and induction of appropriate systemic and mucosal immune responses against pertussis.",
      "# Title: Rotavirus VP6 protein mucosally delivered by cell wall-derived particles from Lactococcus lactis induces protection against infection in a murine model.\n# Abstract: Rotaviruses are the primary cause of acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide. Although the implementation of live attenuated vaccines has reduced the number of rotavirus-associated deaths, variance in their effectiveness has been reported in different countries. This fact, among other concerns, leads to continuous efforts for the development of new generation of vaccines against rotavirus.In this work, we describe the obtention of cell wall-derived particles from a recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a cell wall-anchored version of the rotavirus VP6 protein. After confirming by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, flow cytometry and electronic immunomicroscopy that these particles were carrying the VP6 protein, their immunogenic potential was evaluated in adult BALB/c mice. For that, mucosal immunizations (oral or intranasal), with or without the dmLT [(double mutant Escherichia coli heat labile toxin LT(R192G/L211A)] adjuvant were performed. The results showed that these cell wall-derived particles were able to generate anti-rotavirus IgG and IgA antibodies only when administered intranasally, whether the adjuvant was present or not. However, the presence of dmLT was necessary to confer protection against rotavirus infection, which was evidenced by a 79.5 percent viral shedding reduction.In summary, this work describes the production of cell wall-derived particles which were able to induce a protective immune response after intranasal immunization. Further studies are needed to characterize the immune response elicited by these particles as well as to determine their potential as an alternative to the use of live L. lactis for mucosal antigen delivery.",

Thereafter, in order to assess the immunogenicity of recombinant L. lactis cells, C57BL/6 mice were immunized by oral gavage.",
      "# Title: A Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB)-Based Vaccine Candidate for Human Norovirus.\n# Abstract: Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are responsible for more than 95% of the non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis epidemics in the world. The CDC estimates that every year 21 million individuals suffer from HuNoV-induced gastroenteritis in the United States. Currently, there is no FDA-approved vaccine for HuNoVs. Development of an effective vaccine has been hampered by the lack of an efficient cell culture system for HuNoVs and a suitable small animal model for pathogenesis study. In this study, we developed lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as a vector to deliver HuNoV antigen. A LAB strain (Lactococcus lactis) carrying VP1 gene of a HuNoV GII.4 virus (LAB-VP1) was constructed. It was found that HuNoV VP1 protein was highly expressed by LAB vector and was secreted into media supernatants. To test whether LAB-based HuNoV vaccine candidate is immunogenic, 4-day-old gnotobiotic piglets were orally inoculated with various doses of LAB-VP1. It was found that LABs were persistent in the small intestine of piglets and shed in pig feces for at least 25 days post inoculation. LAB DNA and VP1 were detected in mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen tissue in LAB-VP1 inoculated groups. HuNoV-specific IgG and IgA were detectable in serum and feces respectively at day 13 post-inoculation, and further increased at later time points. After being challenged with HuNoV GII.4 strain, a large amount of HuNoV antigens were observed in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum sections of the intestine in the LAB control group.

      "# Title: Mucosal Vaccination with Lactococcus lactis-Secreting Surface Immunological Protein Induces Humoral and Cellular Immune Protection against Group B Streptococcus in a Murine Model.\n# Abstract: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the primary etiological agent of sepsis and meningitis in newborns and is associated with premature birth and stillbirth. The development of a licensed vaccine is one of the pending challenges for the World Health Organization. Previously, we showed that oral immunization with surface immune protein (SIP) decreases vaginal colonization of GBS and generates functional opsonizing antibodies, which was determined by opsonophagocytic assays (OPA) in vitro. We also showed that the protein has an adjuvant vaccine profile. Therefore, an oral vaccine based on SIP may be an attractive alternative to employ in the development of new vaccines against GBS. Lactococcus lactis is a highlighted oral vaccine probiotic inducer of the mucosal immune response. This bacterium could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of an edible vaccine and has been used in clinical trials. In this study, we showed that an oral vaccine with a recombinant L. lactis strain secreting SIP from GBS (rL. lactis-SIP) can induce protective humoral and cellular immunity in an experimental model of GBS vaginal colonization in C57BL/6 mice. Mice immunized with rL. lactis-SIP were protected against clinical symptoms and bacterial colonization after GBS vaginal colonization. Our rL. lactis-SIP vaccine also induces an increase of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) specifically against SIP. The adoptive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice to naïve mice generated protection against GBS vaginal colonization. Moreover, the rL. lactis-SIP strain induces the activation of SIP-specific T cells, which could decrease GBS vaginal colonization and generate protective antibodies when transferred to other mice. Our experimental observations strongly support the notion that rL. lactis-SIP induces protective humoral and cellular immunity and could be considered as a novel alternative in the development of vaccines for GBS.",
      "# Title: Recombinant Lactococcus Lactis Displaying Omp31 Antigen of Brucella melitensis Can Induce an Immunogenic Response in BALB/c Mice.\n# Abstract: Since Brucella infection mostly occurs through the mucosal surfaces, immune response induced by vaccine that is delivered by a way of mucosal route can be drastically enhanced to control the brucellosis. Omp31is the major outer membrane protein of Brucella, and is considered as a protective antigen against Brucella infection. Accordingly, Lactococcus lactis has been used as an antigen-delivering vector to develop a vaccine-induced mucosal response for having a safer vaccination against brucellosis. A designed omp31 gene fused to the usp45 signal peptide and M6 cell wall anchor was sub cloned in the pNZ7021 expression vector, and a recombinant L. lactis displaying Omp31 was constructed. Omp31 protein expression was confirmed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. Animals were orally and intraperitoneally immunized with live or killed L. lactis expressing Omp31, respectively. The humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated by measuring the specific cytokines and antibodies. sIgA, serum IgA, IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in the mice immunized with live recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31 and also serum IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in mice immunized with killed recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31. Among IgG subtypes, IgG2a response was significantly higher in both groups compared to IgG1. In mice groups immunized with recombinant L. lactis, the IFN-γ and IL-10 level elevated; however, there was no change in the level of IL-4. These results indicated that recombinants L. lactis induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, and also vaccines based on L. lactis-derived live carriers are promising interventions against Brucella melitensis infections.",
      "# Title: Lactococcus lactis FNBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) Induces Cellular and Humoral Immune Responses After Oral Immunization of Mice.\n# Abstract: The development of a new vaccine strategy against tuberculosis is urgently needed and has been greatly encouraged by the scientific community worldwide. In this work, we constructed a lactococcal DNA vaccine based on the fusion of two Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens, ESAT-6 and Ag85A, and examined its immunogenicity. The coding sequences of the ESAT-6 and Ag85A genes were fused and cloned into the eukaryotic expression pValac vector, and the functionality of the vector was confirmed in vitro. Then, L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) was obtained and used for oral immunization of mice. This strain induced significant increases in IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-17 cytokines in stimulated splenocyte cultures, and significant production of antigen-specific sIgA was observed in the colonic tissues of immunized mice. We demonstrated that L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) generated a cellular and humoral immune response after oral immunization of mice. The strategy developed in this work may represent an interesting DNA mucosal vaccine candidate against tuberculosis, using the fusion of two highly immunogenic antigens delivered by safe lactic acid bacteria.",
      "# Title: Protective Immunity Against Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli by Oral Vaccination of Engineered Lactococcus lactis.\n# Abstract: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the leading causes of diarrhea in children globally, and thus suitable vaccines are desired. Antigen display on lactic acid bacteria is a reliable approach for efficient oral vaccination and preventing bowel diseases. To develop an oral vaccine against ETEC, the gene of the binding domain from heat-labile toxin (LTB), a key ETEC virulence factor, was codon-optimized and cloned into a construct containing a signal peptide and an anchor for display on L. lactis. Bioinformatics analysis showed a codon adaptation index of 0.95 for the codon-optimized gene. Cell surface expression of LTB was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and blotting. White New Zealand rabbits were immunized per os (PO) with the recombinant L. lactis, and the antibody titers were assayed with ELISA. In vitro neutralization assay was performed using mouse adrenal tumor cells and rabbit ileal loop test was performed as the in vivo assay. ELISA results indicated that oral administration of the engineered L. lactis elicited a significant production of IgA in the intestine. In vitro neutralization assay showed that the effect of the toxin could be neutralized with 500 µg/ml of IgG isolated from the oral vaccine group. Furthermore, the dose of ETEC causing fluid accumulation in the ileal loop test showed a tenfold increase in rabbits immunized with either recombinant L. lactis or LTB protein compared to other groups. Our results imply that recombinant L. lactis could potentially be an effective live oral vaccine against ETEC toxicity.",
      "# Title: Oral Immunization of Mice with Cell Extracts from Recombinant Lactococcus lactis Expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein.\n# Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all over the world and became a pandemic that named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). At present, several intramuscular vaccines have been successfully developed and mass vaccination has progressed in many countries. The aim of the study is to develop and examine an oral vaccine against COVID-19 with recombinant Lactococcus lactis IL1403, a strain of lactic acid bacteria, expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) S1 subunit as an immunizing antigen. PBS or cell extracts from recombinant L. lactis were orally administered into mice (control VS treatment), and formation of antigen-specific antibodies and changes in the gut microbiome were analyzed. Intracellular antigen was detected, but its secretion was not successful. After immunization, antigen-specific serum IgG and fecal IgA levels were 1.5-fold (P = 0.002) and 1.4-fold (P = 0.016) higher in the immunized mice (treatment) than control, respectively. Gut microbiome profiles were clearly separated between the two groups when analyzed for beta diversity with overall similarity. At the genus level, while Coprococcus (P = 0.036) and unclassified genus of Ruminococcaceae (P = 0.037) in treatment were more abundant than control, rc4-4 (P = 0.013) and Stenotrophomonas (P = 0.021) were less abundant. Our results indicate that cell extract containing SARS-CoV-2 antigen can induce mice to produce antigen-specific antibodies without overall changes in the gut microbiome. This strategy may be useful for the development of other oral viral vaccines.",
      "# Title: Oral Immunization With a M Cell-Targeting Recombinant L. Lactis Vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE Stimulate Protective Immunity Against H. Pylori in Mice.\n# Abstract: There are many virulence factors of H. pylori that contribute in diverse ways to gastric disease. Therefore, designing multivalent epitope vaccines against many key virulence factors virulence factors of H. pylori is a promising strategy to control H. pylori infection. In previous studies, we constructed a multivalent epitope vaccine FVpE against four key virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), and oral immunization with the FVpE vaccine plus a polysaccharide adjuvant (PA) containing lycium barbarum polysaccharide and chitosan could provide protection against H. pylori infection in the Mongolian gerbil model. Oral vaccines have many advantages over injected vaccines, such as improved safety and compliance, and easier manufacturing and administration. However, the harsh gastrointestinal (GI) environment, such as gastric acid and proteolytic enzymes, limits the development of oral vaccines to some extent. Oral vaccines need a gastrointestinal delivery system with high safety, low price and promoting vaccine antigen to stimulate immune response in the gastrointestinal mucosa. Lactic acid bacteria are gastrointestinal probiotics that have unique advantages as a delivery system for oral vaccines. In this study, a M cell-targeting surface display system for L. lactis named plSAM was designed to help vaccine antigens to stimulate effective immune responses in the gastrointestinal tract, and a M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE was constructed by using the surface display system plSAM. recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE could secretively express the SAM-FVpE protein and display it on the bacterial surface. Moreover, experimental results confirmed that LL-plSAM-FVpE had an enhanced M cell-targeting property. In addition, LL-plSAM-FVpE had excellent M cell-targeting property to promote the phagocytosis and transport of the antigen SAM-FVpE by gastrointestinal M cells. More importantly, oral immunization of LL-plSAM-FVpE or SAM-FVpE plus PA can stimulate IgG and sIgA antibodies and CD4+ T cell immune responses against four virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), thus providing protective immunity against H. pylori infection in mice. The M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine against various key H. pylori virulence factors could be a promising vaccine candidate for controlling H. pylori infection.",
      "# Title: Oral and intranasal immunization with food-grade recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing high conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein triggers mice's immunity responses.\n# Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic began at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread throughout the world. Vaccination is still the most effective method of prevention of pathogenic infections, including viral infections. However, there is little evidence that vaccination can protect against SARS-CoV-2 virus for a long time. Thus, regular re-vaccination is necessary to control COVID-19. Vaccination by injection is invasive, and is one of the reasons people refuse to get re-vaccinated. Therefore, we developed a less invasive vaccine based on oral or nasal administration. The gene encoding the high conserved region (HCR) spike protein was inserted into pNZ8149 and expressed in L.lactis NZ3900. Mice were immunized at 3-week intervals with oral or nasal routes. Anti-SARS-CoV2 spike antibody (IgG and IgA) level were measured using ELISA method before and after treatment. Plasma cells population in lymph were analyzed using flowcytometry and the CD4 + and CD8 + cells in lymph and intestine were analyzed using immunofluorescence method. The results of nasal and oral administration in experimental animals showed that L.lactis carrying the HCR gene could induce a humoral immune response, as indicated by increased levels of IgG and IgA against SARS-CoV-2 (IgG/IgA-SARS-CoV-2). The plasma cell population after nasal and oral vaccination in mice were significantly different with control group (p < 0.05). The CD4 + and CD8 + cells in intestine were significantly higher in orally immunized group mice than control group. The CD8 + cells in lymph were significantly higher in intranasal immunized group mice than control group. Our data demonstrate L.lactis expressing spike protein can be developed into a less invasive alternative to nasal and oral vaccination.",
      "# Title: Expanding strain coverage of a group A Streptococcus pilus-expressing Lactococcus lactis mucosal vaccine.\n# Abstract: Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a human pathogenic bacterium that can trigger a wide range of diseases, including the autoimmune diseases acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, causing major morbidity and mortality in many low- and middle-income countries. Primary intervention programs have had limited success thus far, and a licensed vaccine has yet to be developed. The pilus of GAS is known to be involved in host cell adhesion, biofilm formation and immune evasion. We have a mucosal vaccine in development that expresses the pilus of GAS on the surface of the nonpathogenic bacterium Lactococcus lactis. To expand strain coverage, we combined seven L. lactis constructs, each expressing a different GAS pilus variant, and investigated the systemic and mucosal immune responses following immunization. Mice immunized with this combination showed specific immunoglobin G and immunoglobin A responses to the GAS pilus proteins of vaccine strains, at levels comparable to mice immunized with a single construct. Cross-reactivity to pilus proteins of nonvaccine strains was also evident. Furthermore, protective efficacy against a homologous strain of GAS in a murine nasopharyngeal colonization model was observed. Overall, this study provides further evidence for using pilus-expressing lactic acid bacteria as a vaccine to prevent upper respiratory tract GAS infections."

A randomized, single-blind study was performed to evaluate the effects of the combination of high-dose furosemide and small-volume hypertonic saline solution (HSS) infusion in the treatment of refractory New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV CHF and a normosodic diet during follow-up. Materials and Methods One hundred seven patients (39 women and 68 men, age range 65-90 years) with refractory CHF (NYHA class IV) of different etiologies, who were unresponsive to high oral doses of furosemide, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digitalis, and nitrates, were enrolled. Inclusion criteria included an ejection fraction (EF) <35%, serum creatinine level <2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level < or =60 mg/dL, reduced urinary volume, and low natriuresis. The patients were randomized in 2 groups (single-blind). Patients in group 1 (20 women and 33 men) received an intravenous (IV) infusion of furosemide (500-1000 mg) plus HSS (150 mL of 1.4%-4.6% NACl) twice a day in 30 minutes. Patients in group 2 (19 women and 35 men) received an IV bolus of furosemide (500-1000 mg) twice a day, without HSS, during a period lasting 6 to 12 days. Both groups received IV KCl (20-40 mEq) to prevent hypokalemia. At study entry, all patients underwent a physical examination and measurement of body weight (BW), blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR), an evaluation of signs of CHF, and measurement of control levels of serum Na, K, Cl, bicarbonate, albumin, uric acid, creatinine, urea, and glycemia daily during hospitalization, and measurements of the daily output of urine for Na, K, and Cl. A chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram were obtained at study entry, during hospitalization, and at the time of discharge from the hospital. During the treatment and after discharge, the daily dietary Na intake was 120 mmol in group 1 versus 80 mmol in group 2, with a fluid intake of 1000 mL daily in both groups. An assessment of BW and 24-hour urinary volume, serum, and urinary laboratory parameters were performed daily until patients reached a compensated state, when IV furosemide was replaced with oral administration (250-500 mg/d).

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 49 patients with type 2 diabetes who underwent radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer in the Department of gastroenterology of the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University from Jan to Dec 2020. They were randomly divided into experimental group and control group according to different perioperative management measures. The perioperative C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell (WBC), interleukin-6(IL-6), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), blood glucose fluctuation and postoperative recovery were compared between the two groups. Results: A total of 49 patients were enrolled in the study (23 in the experimental group and 26 in the control group). The degree of stress reaction of the experimental group was lighter than that of the control group. The levels of CRP were significantly different on the 5th and 7th day after operation, IL-6 was significantly different on the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th day after operation, WBC and HOMA-IR were significantly different on the 1st day postoperatively. And the changes of HOMA-IR and blood glucose in experimental group were more gentle than those in control group. All the differences were statistically significant(P<0.05). In the experimental group, the time of first anal exhaust, indwelling time of drainage tube or nasointestinal tube and the total hospitalization time were significantly shorter than those of the control group(P<0.05). Conclusion: ERAS can reduce the degree of inflammatory stress and the postoperative IR level promote the early recovery of patients with gastric cancer complicated with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

      "# Title: Genome-wide survey reveals predisposing diabetes type 2-related DNA methylation variations in human peripheral blood.\n# Abstract: Inter-individual DNA methylation variations were frequently hypothesized to alter individual susceptibility to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Sequence-influenced methylations were described in T2DM-associated genomic regions, but evidence for direct, sequence-independent association with disease risk is missing. Here, we explore disease-contributing DNA methylation through a stepwise study design: first, a pool-based, genome-scale screen among 1169 case and control individuals revealed an excess of differentially methylated sites in genomic regions that were previously associated with T2DM through genetic studies. Next, in-depth analyses were performed at selected top-ranking regions. A CpG site in the first intron of the FTO gene showed small (3.35%) but significant (P = 0.000021) hypomethylation of cases relative to controls. The effect was independent of the sequence polymorphism in the region and persists among individuals carrying the sequence-risk alleles. The odds of belonging to the T2DM group increased by 6.1% for every 1% decrease in methylation (OR = 1.061, 95% CI: 1.032-1.090), the odds ratio for decrease of 1 standard deviation of methylation (adjusted to gender) was 1.5856 (95% CI: 1.2824-1.9606) and the sensitivity (area under the curve = 0.638, 95% CI: 0.586-0.690; males = 0.675, females = 0.609) was better than that of the strongest known sequence variant. Furthermore, a prospective study in an independent population cohort revealed significant hypomethylation of young individuals that later progressed to T2DM, relative to the individuals who stayed healthy. Further genomic analysis revealed co-localization with gene enhancers and with binding sites for methylation-sensitive transcriptional regulators. The data showed that low methylation level at the analyzed sites is an early marker of T2DM and suggests a novel mechanism by which early-onset, inter-individual methylation variation at isolated non-promoter genomic sites predisposes to T2DM.",
      "# Title: DNA methylation profiling identifies epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetic patients.\n# Abstract: In addition to genetic predisposition, environmental and lifestyle factors contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Epigenetic changes may provide the link for translating environmental exposures into pathological mechanisms. In this study, we performed the first comprehensive DNA methylation profiling in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We uncovered 276 CpG loci affiliated to promoters of 254 genes displaying significant differential DNA methylation in diabetic islets. These methylation changes were not present in blood cells from T2D individuals nor were they experimentally induced in non-diabetic islets by exposure to high glucose. For a subgroup of the differentially methylated genes, concordant transcriptional changes were present. Functional annotation of the aberrantly methylated genes and RNAi experiments highlighted pathways implicated in β-cell survival and function; some are implicated in cellular dysfunction while others facilitate adaptation to stressors. Together, our findings offer new insights into the intricate mechanisms of T2D pathogenesis, underscore the important involvement of epigenetic dysregulation in diabetic islets and may advance our understanding of T2D aetiology.",

      "# Title: Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of human pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic donors identifies candidate genes that influence insulin secretion.\n# Abstract: Impaired insulin secretion is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Epigenetics may affect disease susceptibility. To describe the human methylome in pancreatic islets and determine the epigenetic basis of T2D, we analyzed DNA methylation of 479,927 CpG sites and the transcriptome in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We provide a detailed map of the global DNA methylation pattern in human islets, β- and α-cells. Genomic regions close to the transcription start site showed low degrees of methylation and regions further away from the transcription start site such as the gene body, 3'UTR and intergenic regions showed a higher degree of methylation. While CpG islands were hypomethylated, the surrounding 2 kb shores showed an intermediate degree of methylation, whereas regions further away (shelves and open sea) were hypermethylated in human islets, β- and α-cells. We identified 1,649 CpG sites and 853 genes, including TCF7L2, FTO and KCNQ1, with differential DNA methylation in T2D islets after correction for multiple testing. The majority of the differentially methylated CpG sites had an intermediate degree of methylation and were underrepresented in CpG islands (∼ 7%) and overrepresented in the open sea (∼ 60%). 102 of the differentially methylated genes, including CDKN1A, PDE7B, SEPT9 and EXOC3L2, were differentially expressed in T2D islets. Methylation of CDKN1A and PDE7B promoters in vitro suppressed their transcriptional activity. Functional analyses demonstrated that identified candidate genes affect pancreatic β- and α-cells as Exoc3l silencing reduced exocytosis and overexpression of Cdkn1a, Pde7b and Sept9 perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion in clonal β- and α-cells, respectively. Together, our data can serve as a reference methylome in human islets. We provide new target genes with altered DNA methylation and expression in human T2D islets that contribute to perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion. These results highlight the importance of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of T2D.",
      "# Title: Altered DNA methylation and differential expression of genes influencing metabolism and inflammation in adipose tissue from subjects with type 2 diabetes.\n# Abstract: Genetics, epigenetics, and environment may together affect the susceptibility for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our aim was to dissect molecular mechanisms underlying T2D using genome-wide expression and DNA methylation data in adipose tissue from monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D and independent case-control cohorts. In adipose tissue from diabetic twins, we found decreased expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation; carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism; and increased expression of genes involved in inflammation and glycan degradation. The most differentially expressed genes included ELOVL6, GYS2, FADS1, SPP1 (OPN), CCL18, and IL1RN. We replicated these results in adipose tissue from an independent case-control cohort. Several candidate genes for obesity and T2D (e.g., IRS1 and VEGFA) were differentially expressed in discordant twins. We found a heritable contribution to the genome-wide DNA methylation variability in twins. Differences in methylation between monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D were subsequently modest. However, 15,627 sites, representing 7,046 genes including PPARG, KCNQ1, TCF7L2, and IRS1, showed differential DNA methylation in adipose tissue from unrelated subjects with T2D compared with control subjects. A total of 1,410 of these sites also showed differential DNA methylation in the twins discordant for T2D. For the differentially methylated sites, the heritability estimate was 0.28. We also identified copy number variants (CNVs) in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D. Taken together, subjects with T2D exhibit multiple transcriptional and epigenetic changes in adipose tissue relevant to the development of the disease.",
      "# Title: An integrated epigenomic analysis for type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci in monozygotic twins.\n# Abstract: DNA methylation has a great potential for understanding the aetiology of common complex traits such as Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here we perform genome-wide methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) in whole-blood-derived DNA from 27 monozygotic twin pairs and follow up results with replication and integrated omics analyses. We identify predominately hypermethylated T2D-related differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and replicate the top signals in 42 unrelated T2D cases and 221 controls. The strongest signal is in the promoter of the MALT1 gene, involved in insulin and glycaemic pathways, and related to taurocholate levels in blood. Integrating the DNA methylome findings with T2D GWAS meta-analysis results reveals a strong enrichment for DMRs in T2D-susceptibility loci. We also detect signals specific to T2D-discordant twins in the GPR61 and PRKCB genes. These replicated T2D associations reflect both likely causal and consequential pathways of the disease. The analysis indicates how an integrated genomics and epigenomics approach, utilizing an MZ twin design, can provide pathogenic insights as well as potential drug targets and biomarkers for T2D and other complex traits.",

      "# Title: Novel epigenetic determinants of type 2 diabetes in Mexican-American families.\n# Abstract: Although DNA methylation is now recognized as an important mediator of complex diseases, the extent to which the genetic basis of such diseases is accounted for by DNA methylation is unknown. In the setting of large, extended families representing a minority, high-risk population of the USA, we aimed to characterize the role of epigenome-wide DNA methylation in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Using Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays, we tested for association of DNA methylation at 446 356 sites with age, sex and phenotypic traits related to T2D in 850 pedigreed Mexican-American individuals. Robust statistical analyses showed that (i) 15% of the methylome is significantly heritable, with a median heritability of 0.14; (ii) DNA methylation at 14% of CpG sites is associated with nearby sequence variants; (iii) 22% and 3% of the autosomal CpG sites are associated with age and sex, respectively; (iv) 53 CpG sites were significantly associated with liability to T2D, fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance; (v) DNA methylation levels at five CpG sites, mapping to three well-characterized genes (TXNIP, ABCG1 and SAMD12) independently explained 7.8% of the heritability of T2D (vi) methylation at these five sites was unlikely to be influenced by neighboring DNA sequence variation. Our study has identified novel epigenetic indicators of T2D risk in Mexican Americans who have increased risk for this disease. These results provide new insights into potential treatment targets of T2D.",

      "# Title: Epigenome-wide association study identifies TXNIP gene associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and sustained hyperglycemia.\n# Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is an established risk factor for a wide range of vascular diseases, including ischemic stroke (IS). Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a marker for average blood glucose levels over the previous 12 weeks, is used as a measure of glycemic control and also as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes (HbA1c levels ≥ 6.5%). Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, may be associated with aging processes and with modulation of the risk of various pathologies, such as DM. Specifically, DNA methylation could be one of the mechanisms mediating the relation between DM and environmental exposures. Our goal was to identify new CpG methylation sites associated with DM. We performed a genome-wide methylation study in whole-blood DNA from an IS patient cohorts. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array was used to measure DNA methylation in CpG sites. All statistical analyses were adjusted for sex, age, hyperlipidemia, body mass index (BMI), smoking habit and cell count. Findings were replicated in two independent cohorts, an IS cohort and a population-based cohort, using the same array. In the discovery phase (N = 355), we identified a CpG site, cg19693031 (located in the TXNIP gene) that was associated with DM (P = 1.17 × 10(-12)); this CpG was replicated in two independent cohorts (N = 167 and N = 645). Methylation of TXNIP was inversely and intensely associated with HbA1c levels (P = 7.3 × 10(-16)), specifically related to diabetic patients with poor control of glucose levels. We identified an association between the TXNIP gene and DM through epigenetic mechanisms, related to sustained hyperglycemia levels (HbA1c ≥ 7%).",

Here we examine whether age-related epigenetic changes affect human islet function and if blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect these changes and associate with future T2D. We analyse DNA methylation genome-wide in islets from 87 non-diabetic donors, aged 26-74 years. Aging associates with increased DNA methylation of 241 sites. These sites cover loci previously associated with T2D, for example, KLF14. Blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related methylation changes in 83 genes identified in human islets (for example, KLF14, FHL2, ZNF518B and FAM123C) and some associate with insulin secretion and T2D. DNA methylation correlates with islet expression of multiple genes, including FHL2, ZNF518B, GNPNAT1 and HLTF. Silencing these genes in β-cells alter insulin secretion. Together, we demonstrate that blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related DNA methylation changes in human islets, and associate with insulin secretion in vivo and T2D.",
      "# Title: Genome-Wide DNA Methylation in Mixed Ancestry Individuals with Diabetes and Prediabetes from South Africa.\n# Abstract: Aims. To conduct a genome-wide DNA methylation in individuals with type 2 diabetes, individuals with prediabetes, and control mixed ancestry individuals from South Africa. Methods. We used peripheral blood to perform genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in 3 individuals with screen detected diabetes, 3 individuals with prediabetes, and 3 individuals with normoglycaemia from the Bellville South Community, Cape Town, South Africa, who were age-, gender-, body mass index-, and duration of residency-matched. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) was performed by Arraystar Inc. (Rockville, MD, USA). Results. Hypermethylated DMRs were 1160 (81.97%) and 124 (43.20%), respectively, in individuals with diabetes and prediabetes when both were compared to subjects with normoglycaemia. Our data shows that genes related to the immune system, signal transduction, glucose transport, and pancreas development have altered DNA methylation in subjects with prediabetes and diabetes. Pathway analysis based on the functional analysis mapping of genes to KEGG pathways suggested that the linoleic acid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism pathways are hypomethylated in prediabetes and diabetes. Conclusions. Our study suggests that epigenetic changes are likely to be an early process that occurs before the onset of overt diabetes. Detailed analysis of DMRs that shows gradual methylation differences from control versus prediabetes to prediabetes versus diabetes in a larger sample size is required to confirm these findings.",
      "# Title: Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing of Human Pancreatic Islets Reveals Novel Differentially Methylated Regions in Type 2 Diabetes Pathogenesis.\n# Abstract: Current knowledge about the role of epigenetics in type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains limited. Only a few studies have investigated DNA methylation of selected candidate genes or a very small fraction of genomic CpG sites in human pancreatic islets, the tissue of primary pathogenic importance for diabetes. Our aim was to characterize the whole-genome DNA methylation landscape in human pancreatic islets, to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in diabetic islets, and to investigate the function of DMRs in islet biology. Here, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, which is a comprehensive and unbiased method to study DNA methylation throughout the genome at a single nucleotide resolution, in pancreatic islets from donors with T2D and control subjects without diabetes. We identified 25,820 DMRs in islets from individuals with T2D. These DMRs cover loci with known islet function, e.g., PDX1, TCF7L2, and ADCY5 Importantly, binding sites previously identified by ChIP-seq for islet-specific transcription factors, enhancer regions, and different histone marks were enriched in the T2D-associated DMRs. We also identified 457 genes, including NR4A3, PARK2, PID1, SLC2A2, and SOCS2, that had both DMRs and significant expression changes in T2D islets. To mimic the situation in T2D islets, candidate genes were overexpressed or silenced in cultured β-cells. This resulted in impaired insulin secretion, thereby connecting differential methylation to islet dysfunction. We further explored the islet methylome and found a strong link between methylation levels and histone marks. Additionally, DNA methylation in different genomic regions and of different transcript types (i.e., protein coding, noncoding, and pseudogenes) was associated with islet expression levels. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the islet DNA methylome in individuals with and without diabetes and highlights the importance of epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets and T2D pathogenesis."

We examined WFA+ -M2BP levels in patients with F4 (cirrhosis), F3 or more (advanced fibrosis) and F2 or more (significant fibrosis) in the two groups. We further examined the relationship between five fibrosis markers and the degree of fibrosis. The WFA+ -M2BP values ranged from 0.25 cut-off index (COI) to 12.9 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 0.34-20.0 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P<.0001). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F4 in the two groups were 2.83 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 5.03 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P=.0046). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F3 or more in the two groups were 1.79 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 3.79 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P<.0001). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F2 or more in the two groups were 1.49 COI in the hepatitis B cohort and 3.19 COI in the hepatitis C group (P<.0001). Among five liver fibrosis markers, WFA+ -M2BP had the highest correlation coefficient (rs =.629) in terms of correlation with the degree of fibrosis in the patients with hepatitis C and had the second highest rs value (.415) in the hepatitis B group.

Consecutive adult NAFLD patients who had a liver biopsy were included. Serum WFA+-M2BP level was measured using a lectin-antibody sandwich immunoassay using a chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay machine (HISCL-5000, Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). The measured levels were indexed using the following equation: Cut-off index (COI) = ([WFA+-M2BP]sample-[WFA+-M2BP]NC) / ([WFA+-M2BP]PC-[WFA+-M2BP]NC), where PC = positive control and NC = negative control. Histopathological examination of liver biopsy specimen was reported according to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Clinical Research Network Scoring System. Data for 220 cases were analyzed. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of NASH was 0.65. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of steatosis grade ≥2 and 3 was 0.64 and 0.53, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of lobular inflammation grade ≥1, ≥2 and 3 was 0.57, 0.68 and 0.59, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of hepatocyte ballooning grade ≥1 and 2 was 0.64 and 0.65, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of fibrosis stage ≥1, ≥2, ≥3 and 4 was 0.61, 0.71, 0.74 and 0.84, respectively. Out of the 220 cases, 152 cases were the same 76 patients who had a repeat liver biopsy after 48 weeks of intervention. The AUROC of the change in the COI to detect improvement in steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning and fibrosis was 0.57, 0.54, 0.59 and 0.52, respectively. In conclusion, serum WFA+-M2BP was most useful for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in NAFLD patients. However, it was less useful for differentiating NASH from non-NASH, and for diagnosis and follow-up of the individual histopathological components of NASH.",
      "# Title: Serum Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2-binding protein expression predicts disease severity in chronic hepatitis C patients.\n# Abstract: Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein (WFA+-M2BP) has recently been developed as a promising liver fibrosis glyco biomarker. We assessed its efficacy in evaluating liver disease severity in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in Taiwan. The association between WFA+-M2BP and histological features was evaluated among those CHC patients underwent liver biopsy. We also aimed to clarify the factors determining the performance of WFA+-M2BP in CHC. A total of 229 CHC patients were consecutively recruited. The mean value of WFA+-M2BP in patients from F0 to F4 was 1.68, 2.23, 3.45, 3.48, 3.77 respectively (linear trend P = 0.008). Linear regression analysis revealed that alanine aminotransferase (odds ratio [OR]: 0.03, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.02-0.05, P < 0.001), AST (OR: -0.1, 95% CI: -0.02 to -0.01, P < 0.001), and liver fibrosis (OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.01-0.59, P = 0.043) were the independent factors correlated to serum WFA+-M2BP level. The optimal cutoff values of WFA+-M2BP for fibrosis stages F1, F2, F3, and F4 were 1.42, 1.61, 1.42, and 2.67, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the platelet count (OR/CI: -0.009/0.986-0.996, P = <0.001), r-glutamyl transferase (OR/CI: 0.007/1.000-1.013, P = 0.036), and WFA+-M2BP (OR/CI: 0.187/1.057-1.374, P = 0.005). We concluded that WFA+-M2BP is a competent noninvasive marker for liver fibrosis assessment in CHC patients.",

      "# Title: Comparison of serum fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B.\n# Abstract: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The diagnosis of liver fibrosis has a key role in selecting patients with CHB for antiviral treatment. However, serum biomarkers demonstrate limited diagnostic utility. The present study aimed to compare the performances of fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB and to identify the most appropriate biomarker for these patients. The current study included 96 antiviral-naïve patients with CHB who underwent liver biopsy. METAVIR scoring system was used to assess liver fibrosis and necroinflammation. The diagnostic performances were evaluated of the platelet (PLT) count; the levels of hyaluronan, serum 7S domain of type 4 collagen, procollagen type III N-terminal peptide, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1, Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) and N-terminal type III collagen propeptide (Pro-C3); the fibrosis index based on four factors; the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index; and enhanced liver fibrosis score for identifying significant liver fibrosis [≥fibrosis stage 2 (F2)]. All fibrosis biomarkers, except the Pro-C3 level, correlated with the fibrosis stage. M2BPGi was better than other biomarkers for diagnosing ≥F2, with the highest area under the curve of 0.902. M2BPGi demonstrated a higher diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis than mild/severe fibrosis or cirrhosis. However, no significant correlation was observed between the M2BPGi level and fibrosis stage in patients with CHB having significant liver necroinflammation defined as ≥ necroinflammatory activity 2. The M2BPGi level and PLT count were exclusively correlated with the fibrosis stage in 73 patients without significant liver necroinflammation. M2BPGi demonstrated the highest diagnostic performance for significant fibrosis in patients having significant liver fibrosis with no significant liver necroinflammation. In conclusion, the M2BPGi level can accurately diagnose significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB.",

This study evaluated the performance of WFA+ -M2BP in predicting fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. A total of 80 patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) were enrolled. Serum WFA+ -M2BP levels were measured using standard methods. The fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index was also measured. The mean values of WFA+ -M2BP were 1.0, 1.0, 0.8, and 2.2 in Metavir fibrosis stage F0, F1, F2, and F3-4, respectively (linear trend p = 0.005). The optimal cut-off value of WFA+ -M2BP in predicting advanced fibrosis (F3-4) was 1.37 cut-off index (COI), yielding the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, and accuracy of 75.0, 79.4, 39.1, 94.7, and 78.7%, respectively (p < 0.001). Combining WFA+ -M2BP with FIB-4 significantly increased the diagnostic performance for advanced fibrosis, yielding specificity, PPV, and accuracy of 100, 100, and 93%, respectively. The significant factors predicting advanced liver fibrosis in the multivariate regression analysis were WFA+ -M2BP ≥ 1.37 COI (OR/confidence interval [CI]: 9.49/1.63-55.21, p = 0.01) and FIB-4 ≥ 2.80 (OR/CI: 38.18/4.89-297.93, p = 0.001).

    "referenceConclusion": "The primary goal of this review was to scope evidence regarding neurocognitive and neurophysiological functions that could be related to ACL injury in athletes and to synthesize them into RTS and rehabilitation paradigms. The existing evidence shows that cognitive skills and CNS functions may be linked to an increased injury risk and diminish postinjury performance in athletes. Cortical reorganization may demand compensatory strategies and occupy cognitive reserve, which makes it difficult to manage dynamic environment in sports. RTS and rehabilitation concepts should consider this notion to prevent second injuries and to achieve an adequate competitive level in athletes.",

      "# Title: Brain Activation for Knee Movement Measured Days Before Second Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury: Neuroimaging in Musculoskeletal Medicine.\n# Abstract: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury has multifactorial causes encompassing mechanical, hormonal, exposure, and anatomical factors. Alterations in the central nervous system also play a role, but their influence after injury, recovery, and recurrent injury remain unknown. Modern neuroimaging techniques can be used to elucidate the underlying functional and structural alterations of the brain that predicate the neuromuscular control adaptations associated with ACL injury. This knowledge will further our understanding of the neural adaptations after ACL injury and rehabilitation and in relation to injury risk. In this paper, we describe the measurement of brain activation during knee extension-flexion after ACL injury and reconstruction and 26 days before a contralateral ACL injury.",
      "# Title: Corticospinal and intracortical excitability differ between athletes early after ACLR and matched controls.\n# Abstract: Neuromuscular impairments, such as quadriceps weakness and activation deficits, persist after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Recent research demonstrating changes in the function of the primary motor cortex after ACLR posits that quadriceps impairments may be influenced by reduced corticospinal excitability. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the integrity of the neuromotor axis of the vastus medialis is altered in subjects 2 weeks post-ACLR compared to uninjured control subjects. Eighteen athletes 2 weeks post-ACLR and 18 age and sex matched uninjured control subjects participated in this cross-sectional study. We quantified corticospinal (resting motor threshold, RMT; motor evoked potential amplitudes at 120% RMT, MEP120 ) and intracortical (inhibition and facilitation) excitability using single and paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), respectively. We assessed spinal-reflex excitability (H-reflex amplitude normalized to maximal M-wave, H/M ratio) using peripheral stimulation. Subjects post-ACLR had higher RMTs (p = 0.001), greater MEP120 amplitudes (p = 0.001), and more asymmetric facilitation (p = 0.041) than the uninjured control subjects. No significant group differences were found for intracortical inhibition (p = 0.289) and H/M ratio (p = 0.332). Our findings indicate that both intracortical and corticospinal excitability of vastus medialis are bilaterally altered in subjects 2 weeks after ACLR. Given persistent neuromuscular deficits seen after ACLR, rehabilitation strategies targeting intracortical and corticospinal deficits may potentially improve clinical outcomes. © 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Data considering the diversity of neural changes, in-concert with morphological adaptations of the quadriceps muscle, are lacking. We investigated bilateral differences in neural and morphological characteristics of the quadriceps muscle in ACLR participants (n = 11, month post-surgery: 69.4 ± 22.4) compared to controls matched by sex, age, height, weight, limb dominance, and activity level. Spinal reflex excitability was assessed using Hoffmann reflexes (H:M); corticospinal excitability was quantified via active motor thresholds (AMT) and motor-evoked potentials (MEP) using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Cortical activation was assessed using a knee flexion/extension task with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Muscle volume was quantified using structural MRI. Muscle strength and patient-reported outcomes were also collected. 2 × 2 RM ANOVAs were used to evaluate group differences. Smaller quadriceps muscle volume (total volume, rectus femoris, vastus medialis, and intermedius) and lower strength were detected compared to contralateral and control limbs. Individuals with ACLR reported higher levels of pain and fear and lower levels of knee function compared to controls. No differences were observed for H:M. ACLR individuals demonstrated higher AMT bilaterally and smaller MEPs in the injured limb, compared to the controls. ACLR participants demonstrated greater activation in frontal lobe areas responsible for motor and pain processing compared to controls, which were associated with self-reported pain. Our results suggest that individuals with ACLR demonstrate systemic neural differences compared to controls, which are observed concurrently with smaller quadriceps muscle volume, quadriceps muscle weakness, and self-reported dysfunction.",

      "# Title: Corticomotor function is associated with quadriceps rate of torque development in individuals with ACL surgery.\n# Abstract: Impaired corticomotor function arising from altered intracortical and corticospinal pathways are theorized to impede muscle recovery following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) surgery, yet functional implications of centrally driven adaptations remain unclear. We aimed to assess relationships between quadriceps corticomotor and neuromechanical function after ACL surgery, and to compare with contralateral and control limbs. 16 individuals after primary, unilateral ACL surgery and 16 sex- and age-matched controls participated. Corticomotor function was assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation, and quantified via active motor thresholds (AMT), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF). Neuromechanical function was quantified via electromechanical delay, early and late-phase rate of torque development (RTD0-50, RTD100-200), coefficient of variation, maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) torque, and central activation ratio. We observed significant correlations in the ACL limbs between: AMT and RTD0-50 (r = - 0.513, p = 0.031), SICI and RTD100-200 (r = 0.501, p = 0.048), AMT and SICI (r = - 0.659, p = 0.010), AMT and ICF (r = 0.579, p = 0.031), RTD0-50 and MVIC (r = 0.504, p = 0.023), and RTD100-200 and MVIC (r = 0.680, p = 0.002). The ACL limbs demonstrated higher AMT compared to controls (44.9 ± 8.4 vs. 30.1 ± 8.2%, p < 0.001), and lesser MVIC torque (2.37 ± 0.52 vs. 2.80 ± 0.59 Nm/kg, p = 0.005) and RTD100-200 (6.79 ± 1.72 vs. 7.90 ± 1.98 Nm/kg/s, p = 0.006) compared to the contralateral limbs. Our findings indicate that lesser corticospinal excitability is associated with lesser early-phase RTD, and greater intracortical inhibition is associated with lesser late-phase RTD. These findings provide evidence of implications of altered intracortical and corticospinal pathways relative to the ability to rapidly generate quadriceps torque following ACL surgery.",

      "# Title: Athletes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction demonstrate asymmetric intracortical facilitation early after surgery.\n# Abstract: Quadriceps dysfunction persists after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), yet the etiology remains elusive. Inhibitory and facilitatory intracortical networks (ie, intracortical excitability) may be involved in quadriceps dysfunction, yet the investigation of these networks early after ACLR is sparse. The purposes of this study were to examine (a) changes in intracortical excitability in athletes after ACLR compared to uninjured athletes during the course of postoperative rehabilitation, (b) the association between intracortical excitability and quadriceps strength in athletes after ACLR. Eighteen level I/II athletes after ACLR between the ages of 18 to 30 years and eighteen healthy sex, age, and activity matched athletes were tested at three-time points: (a) 2 weeks after surgery, (b) achievement of a \"quiet knee\" defined as full range of motion and minimal effusion, (c) return to running time point defined as achievement of a quadriceps index ≥80% and at least 12 weeks post-ACLR. Short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF), measured via transcranial magnetic stimulation and isometric quadriceps strength were examined bilaterally at each time point. There was a significant group × limb interaction (P = .017) for ICF. The ACLR group demonstrated asymmetric ICF (greater in the nonsurgical limb) compared to controls and a significant relationship between SICI and quadriceps strength of the surgical limb at the quiet knee time point (P = .018). ACLR individuals demonstrate differential effects on ICF between limbs. Also, SICI is associated with isometric quadriceps strength after ACLR, suggesting increased inhibition of the motor cortex may contribute to impaired quadriceps strength following ACLR.",

      "# Title: Neural activity for hip-knee control in those with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A task-based functional connectivity analysis.\n# Abstract: Anterior cruciate ligament injury may induce neurophysiological changes for sensorimotor control. Neuroimaging investigations have revealed unique brain activity patterns for knee movement following injury, indicating potential neural mechanisms underlying aberrant neuromuscular control that may contribute to heightened risk of secondary injury, altered movement patterns and poor patient outcomes. However, neuroimaging paradigms thus far have been limited to single joint, single motion knee tasks. Therefore, we sought to overcome prior limitations to understand the effects of injury on neural control of lower extremity movement by employing a multi-joint motor paradigm and determining differences in neural activity between ACL-reconstructed (ACLr) individuals relative to healthy matched controls. Fifteen patients with left anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and fifteen matched healthy controls participated in this study. Neural activity was examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging during a block-designed knee-hip movement paradigm (similar to a supine heel-slide). Participants for each group were monitored and task performance was controlled via a metronome to ensure the same spatial-temporal parameters. We observed that those with ACL reconstruction displayed increased activation within the intracalcarine cortex, lingual gyrus, occipital fusiform gyrus, lateral occipital cortex, angular gyrus, and superior parietal lobule relative to controls. A follow-up task-based functional connectivity analyses using seed regions identified from the group analysis revealed connectivity among fronto-insular-temporal and sensorimotor regions within the ACLr participants. The results of this fMRI investigation suggest ACLr individuals require increased activity and connectivity in areas responsible for visual-spatial cognition and orientation, and attention for hip and knee motor control."

      "# Title: Sexual and reproductive health of migrants: does the EU care?\n# Abstract: The European Union (EU) refers to health as a human right in many internal and external communications, policies and agreements, defending its universality. In parallel, specific health needs of migrants originating from outside the EU have been acknowledged. Yet, their right to health and in particular sexual and reproductive health (SRH) is currently not ensured throughout the EU. This paper reflects on the results of a comprehensive literature review on migrants' SRH in the EU applying the Critical Interpretive Synthesis review method. We highlight the discrepancy between a proclaimed rights-based approach to health and actual obstacles to migrants' attainment of good SRH. Uncertainties on entitlements of diverse migrant groups are fuelled by unclear legal provisions, creating significant barriers to access health systems in general and SRH services in particular. Furthermore, the rare strategies addressing migrants' health fail to address sexual health and are generally limited to perinatal care and HIV screening. Thus, future European public health policy-making should not only strongly encourage its Member States to ensure equal access to health care for migrants as for EU citizens, but also promote migrants' SRH effectively through a holistic and inclusive approach in SRH policies, prevention and care.",
      "# Title: Evaluating the impact of immigration policies on health status among undocumented immigrants: a systematic review.\n# Abstract: Over the past two decades, new anti-immigration policies and laws have emerged to address the migration of undocumented immigrants. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to assess and understand how these immigration policies and laws may affect both access to health services and health outcomes among undocumented immigrants. Eight databases were used to conduct this review, which returned 325 papers that were assessed for validity based on specified inclusion criteria. Forty critically appraised articles were selected for analysis; thirty articles related to access to health services, and ten related to health outcomes. The articles showed a direct relationship between anti-immigration policies and their effects on access to health services. In addition, as a result of these policies, undocumented immigrants were impacted by mental health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Action items were presented, including the promotion of cultural diversity training and the development of innovative strategies to support safety-net health care facilities serving vulnerable populations.",

      "# Title: What the eye does not see: a critical interpretive synthesis of European Union policies addressing sexual violence in vulnerable migrants.\n# Abstract: In Europe, refugees, asylum seekers and undocumented migrants are more vulnerable to sexual victimisation than European citizens. They face more challenges when seeking care. This literature review examines how legal and policy frameworks at national, European and international levels condition the prevention of and response to sexual violence affecting these vulnerable migrant communities living in the European Union (EU). Applying the Critical Interpretive Synthesis method, we reviewed 187 legal and policy documents and 80 peer-reviewed articles on migrant sexual health for elements on sexual violence and further analysed the 37 legal and 12 peer-reviewed articles among them that specifically focused on sexual violence in vulnerable migrants in the EU-27 States. Legal and policy documents dealing with sexual violence, particularly but not exclusively in vulnerable migrants, apply 'tunnel vision'. They ignore: a) frequently occurring types of sexual violence, b) victimisation rates across genders and c) specific risk factors within the EU such as migrants' legal status, gender orientation and living conditions. The current EU policy-making paradigm relegates sexual violence in vulnerable migrants as an 'outsider' and 'female only' issue while EU migration and asylum policies reinforce its invisibility. Effective response must be guided by participatory rights- and evidence-based policies and a public health approach, acknowledging the occurrence and multiplicity of sexual victimisation of vulnerable migrants of all genders within EU borders.",
      "# Title: Human Trafficking in Ethiopia: A Scoping Review to Identify Gaps in Service Delivery, Research, and Policy.\n# Abstract: The purpose of this review is to integrate evidence on human trafficking in Ethiopia and identify gaps and recommendations for service delivery, research and training, and policy. A scoping literature review approach was used to systematically search nursing, medical, psychological, law, and international databases and synthesize information on a complex, understudied topic. The search yielded 826 articles, and 39 met the predetermined criteria for inclusion in the review. Trafficking in Ethiopia has occurred internally and externally in the form of adult and child labor and sex trafficking. There were also some reports of organ trafficking and other closely related human rights violations, such as child marriage, child soldiering, and exploitative intercountry adoption. Risk factors for trafficking included push factors (poverty, political instability, economic problems, and gender discrimination) and pull factors (demand for cheap labor). Trafficking was associated with poor health and economic outcomes for victims. Key recommendations for service delivery, research and training, and policy are identified, including establishing comprehensive services for survivor rehabilitation and reintegration, conducting quantitative health outcomes research, and reforming policy around migration and trafficking. Implementing the recommendations identified by this review will allow policy makers, researchers, and practitioners to take meaningful steps toward confronting human trafficking in Ethiopia.",

      "# Title: Factors Influencing the Accuracy of Infectious Disease Reporting in Migrants: A Scoping Review.\n# Abstract: We conducted a scoping review of literature to improve our understanding of the accuracy of infectious disease monitoring in migrants in the Europe. We searched PubMed for papers relevant to the topic including: case reports, observational and experimental studies, reviews, guidelines or policy documents; published after 1994. We identified 532 papers, 27 of which were included in the review. Legislation and right to access health care influence both the accuracy of rates and risk measures under estimating the at risk population, i.e., the denominator. Furthermore, the number of reported cases, i.e., the numerator, may also include cases not accounted for in the denominator. Both biases lead to an overestimated disease occurrence. Restriction to healthcare access and low responsiveness may cause under-detection of cases, however a quantification of this phenomenon has not been produced. On the contrary, screening for asymptomatic diseases increases ascertainment leading to increased detection of cases. Incompleteness of denominator data underestimates the at-risk population. In conclusion, most studies show a lower probability of under-reporting infectious diseases in migrants compared with native populations."

Sequence-influenced methylations were described in T2DM-associated genomic regions, but evidence for direct, sequence-independent association with disease risk is missing. Here, we explore disease-contributing DNA methylation through a stepwise study design: first, a pool-based, genome-scale screen among 1169 case and control individuals revealed an excess of differentially methylated sites in genomic regions that were previously associated with T2DM through genetic studies. Next, in-depth analyses were performed at selected top-ranking regions. A CpG site in the first intron of the FTO gene showed small (3.35%) but significant (P = 0.000021) hypomethylation of cases relative to controls. The effect was independent of the sequence polymorphism in the region and persists among individuals carrying the sequence-risk alleles. The odds of belonging to the T2DM group increased by 6.1% for every 1% decrease in methylation (OR = 1.061, 95% CI: 1.032-1.090), the odds ratio for decrease of 1 standard deviation of methylation (adjusted to gender) was 1.5856 (95% CI: 1.2824-1.9606) and the sensitivity (area under the curve = 0.638, 95% CI: 0.586-0.690; males = 0.675, females = 0.609) was better than that of the strongest known sequence variant. Furthermore, a prospective study in an independent population cohort revealed significant hypomethylation of young individuals that later progressed to T2DM, relative to the individuals who stayed healthy. Further genomic analysis revealed co-localization with gene enhancers and with binding sites for methylation-sensitive transcriptional regulators. The data showed that low methylation level at the analyzed sites is an early marker of T2DM and suggests a novel mechanism by which early-onset, inter-individual methylation variation at isolated non-promoter genomic sites predisposes to T2DM.",
      "# Title: DNA methylation profiling identifies epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetic patients.\n# Abstract: In addition to genetic predisposition, environmental and lifestyle factors contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Epigenetic changes may provide the link for translating environmental exposures into pathological mechanisms. In this study, we performed the first comprehensive DNA methylation profiling in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We uncovered 276 CpG loci affiliated to promoters of 254 genes displaying significant differential DNA methylation in diabetic islets. These methylation changes were not present in blood cells from T2D individuals nor were they experimentally induced in non-diabetic islets by exposure to high glucose. For a subgroup of the differentially methylated genes, concordant transcriptional changes were present. Functional annotation of the aberrantly methylated genes and RNAi experiments highlighted pathways implicated in β-cell survival and function; some are implicated in cellular dysfunction while others facilitate adaptation to stressors. Together, our findings offer new insights into the intricate mechanisms of T2D pathogenesis, underscore the important involvement of epigenetic dysregulation in diabetic islets and may advance our understanding of T2D aetiology.",

      "# Title: Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of human pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic donors identifies candidate genes that influence insulin secretion.\n# Abstract: Impaired insulin secretion is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Epigenetics may affect disease susceptibility. To describe the human methylome in pancreatic islets and determine the epigenetic basis of T2D, we analyzed DNA methylation of 479,927 CpG sites and the transcriptome in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We provide a detailed map of the global DNA methylation pattern in human islets, β- and α-cells. Genomic regions close to the transcription start site showed low degrees of methylation and regions further away from the transcription start site such as the gene body, 3'UTR and intergenic regions showed a higher degree of methylation. While CpG islands were hypomethylated, the surrounding 2 kb shores showed an intermediate degree of methylation, whereas regions further away (shelves and open sea) were hypermethylated in human islets, β- and α-cells. We identified 1,649 CpG sites and 853 genes, including TCF7L2, FTO and KCNQ1, with differential DNA methylation in T2D islets after correction for multiple testing. The majority of the differentially methylated CpG sites had an intermediate degree of methylation and were underrepresented in CpG islands (∼ 7%) and overrepresented in the open sea (∼ 60%). 102 of the differentially methylated genes, including CDKN1A, PDE7B, SEPT9 and EXOC3L2, were differentially expressed in T2D islets. Methylation of CDKN1A and PDE7B promoters in vitro suppressed their transcriptional activity. Functional analyses demonstrated that identified candidate genes affect pancreatic β- and α-cells as Exoc3l silencing reduced exocytosis and overexpression of Cdkn1a, Pde7b and Sept9 perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion in clonal β- and α-cells, respectively. Together, our data can serve as a reference methylome in human islets. We provide new target genes with altered DNA methylation and expression in human T2D islets that contribute to perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion. These results highlight the importance of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of T2D.",
      "# Title: Altered DNA methylation and differential expression of genes influencing metabolism and inflammation in adipose tissue from subjects with type 2 diabetes.\n# Abstract: Genetics, epigenetics, and environment may together affect the susceptibility for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our aim was to dissect molecular mechanisms underlying T2D using genome-wide expression and DNA methylation data in adipose tissue from monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D and independent case-control cohorts. In adipose tissue from diabetic twins, we found decreased expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation; carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism; and increased expression of genes involved in inflammation and glycan degradation. The most differentially expressed genes included ELOVL6, GYS2, FADS1, SPP1 (OPN), CCL18, and IL1RN. We replicated these results in adipose tissue from an independent case-control cohort. Several candidate genes for obesity and T2D (e.g., IRS1 and VEGFA) were differentially expressed in discordant twins. We found a heritable contribution to the genome-wide DNA methylation variability in twins. Differences in methylation between monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D were subsequently modest. However, 15,627 sites, representing 7,046 genes including PPARG, KCNQ1, TCF7L2, and IRS1, showed differential DNA methylation in adipose tissue from unrelated subjects with T2D compared with control subjects. A total of 1,410 of these sites also showed differential DNA methylation in the twins discordant for T2D. For the differentially methylated sites, the heritability estimate was 0.28. We also identified copy number variants (CNVs) in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D. Taken together, subjects with T2D exhibit multiple transcriptional and epigenetic changes in adipose tissue relevant to the development of the disease.",
      "# Title: An integrated epigenomic analysis for type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci in monozygotic twins.\n# Abstract: DNA methylation has a great potential for understanding the aetiology of common complex traits such as Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here we perform genome-wide methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) in whole-blood-derived DNA from 27 monozygotic twin pairs and follow up results with replication and integrated omics analyses. We identify predominately hypermethylated T2D-related differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and replicate the top signals in 42 unrelated T2D cases and 221 controls. The strongest signal is in the promoter of the MALT1 gene, involved in insulin and glycaemic pathways, and related to taurocholate levels in blood. Integrating the DNA methylome findings with T2D GWAS meta-analysis results reveals a strong enrichment for DMRs in T2D-susceptibility loci. We also detect signals specific to T2D-discordant twins in the GPR61 and PRKCB genes. These replicated T2D associations reflect both likely causal and consequential pathways of the disease. The analysis indicates how an integrated genomics and epigenomics approach, utilizing an MZ twin design, can provide pathogenic insights as well as potential drug targets and biomarkers for T2D and other complex traits.",

      "# Title: Novel epigenetic determinants of type 2 diabetes in Mexican-American families.\n# Abstract: Although DNA methylation is now recognized as an important mediator of complex diseases, the extent to which the genetic basis of such diseases is accounted for by DNA methylation is unknown. In the setting of large, extended families representing a minority, high-risk population of the USA, we aimed to characterize the role of epigenome-wide DNA methylation in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Using Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays, we tested for association of DNA methylation at 446 356 sites with age, sex and phenotypic traits related to T2D in 850 pedigreed Mexican-American individuals. Robust statistical analyses showed that (i) 15% of the methylome is significantly heritable, with a median heritability of 0.14; (ii) DNA methylation at 14% of CpG sites is associated with nearby sequence variants; (iii) 22% and 3% of the autosomal CpG sites are associated with age and sex, respectively; (iv) 53 CpG sites were significantly associated with liability to T2D, fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance; (v) DNA methylation levels at five CpG sites, mapping to three well-characterized genes (TXNIP, ABCG1 and SAMD12) independently explained 7.8% of the heritability of T2D (vi) methylation at these five sites was unlikely to be influenced by neighboring DNA sequence variation. Our study has identified novel epigenetic indicators of T2D risk in Mexican Americans who have increased risk for this disease. These results provide new insights into potential treatment targets of T2D.",

      "# Title: Epigenome-wide association study identifies TXNIP gene associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and sustained hyperglycemia.\n# Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is an established risk factor for a wide range of vascular diseases, including ischemic stroke (IS). Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a marker for average blood glucose levels over the previous 12 weeks, is used as a measure of glycemic control and also as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes (HbA1c levels ≥ 6.5%). Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, may be associated with aging processes and with modulation of the risk of various pathologies, such as DM. Specifically, DNA methylation could be one of the mechanisms mediating the relation between DM and environmental exposures. Our goal was to identify new CpG methylation sites associated with DM. We performed a genome-wide methylation study in whole-blood DNA from an IS patient cohorts. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array was used to measure DNA methylation in CpG sites. All statistical analyses were adjusted for sex, age, hyperlipidemia, body mass index (BMI), smoking habit and cell count. Findings were replicated in two independent cohorts, an IS cohort and a population-based cohort, using the same array. In the discovery phase (N = 355), we identified a CpG site, cg19693031 (located in the TXNIP gene) that was associated with DM (P = 1.17 × 10(-12)); this CpG was replicated in two independent cohorts (N = 167 and N = 645). Methylation of TXNIP was inversely and intensely associated with HbA1c levels (P = 7.3 × 10(-16)), specifically related to diabetic patients with poor control of glucose levels. We identified an association between the TXNIP gene and DM through epigenetic mechanisms, related to sustained hyperglycemia levels (HbA1c ≥ 7%).",

Here we examine whether age-related epigenetic changes affect human islet function and if blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect these changes and associate with future T2D. We analyse DNA methylation genome-wide in islets from 87 non-diabetic donors, aged 26-74 years. Aging associates with increased DNA methylation of 241 sites. These sites cover loci previously associated with T2D, for example, KLF14. Blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related methylation changes in 83 genes identified in human islets (for example, KLF14, FHL2, ZNF518B and FAM123C) and some associate with insulin secretion and T2D. DNA methylation correlates with islet expression of multiple genes, including FHL2, ZNF518B, GNPNAT1 and HLTF. Silencing these genes in β-cells alter insulin secretion. Together, we demonstrate that blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related DNA methylation changes in human islets, and associate with insulin secretion in vivo and T2D.",
      "# Title: Genome-Wide DNA Methylation in Mixed Ancestry Individuals with Diabetes and Prediabetes from South Africa.\n# Abstract: Aims. To conduct a genome-wide DNA methylation in individuals with type 2 diabetes, individuals with prediabetes, and control mixed ancestry individuals from South Africa. Methods. We used peripheral blood to perform genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in 3 individuals with screen detected diabetes, 3 individuals with prediabetes, and 3 individuals with normoglycaemia from the Bellville South Community, Cape Town, South Africa, who were age-, gender-, body mass index-, and duration of residency-matched. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) was performed by Arraystar Inc. (Rockville, MD, USA). Results. Hypermethylated DMRs were 1160 (81.97%) and 124 (43.20%), respectively, in individuals with diabetes and prediabetes when both were compared to subjects with normoglycaemia. Our data shows that genes related to the immune system, signal transduction, glucose transport, and pancreas development have altered DNA methylation in subjects with prediabetes and diabetes. Pathway analysis based on the functional analysis mapping of genes to KEGG pathways suggested that the linoleic acid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism pathways are hypomethylated in prediabetes and diabetes. Conclusions. Our study suggests that epigenetic changes are likely to be an early process that occurs before the onset of overt diabetes. Detailed analysis of DMRs that shows gradual methylation differences from control versus prediabetes to prediabetes versus diabetes in a larger sample size is required to confirm these findings.",
      "# Title: Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing of Human Pancreatic Islets Reveals Novel Differentially Methylated Regions in Type 2 Diabetes Pathogenesis.\n# Abstract: Current knowledge about the role of epigenetics in type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains limited. Only a few studies have investigated DNA methylation of selected candidate genes or a very small fraction of genomic CpG sites in human pancreatic islets, the tissue of primary pathogenic importance for diabetes. Our aim was to characterize the whole-genome DNA methylation landscape in human pancreatic islets, to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in diabetic islets, and to investigate the function of DMRs in islet biology. Here, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, which is a comprehensive and unbiased method to study DNA methylation throughout the genome at a single nucleotide resolution, in pancreatic islets from donors with T2D and control subjects without diabetes. We identified 25,820 DMRs in islets from individuals with T2D. These DMRs cover loci with known islet function, e.g., PDX1, TCF7L2, and ADCY5 Importantly, binding sites previously identified by ChIP-seq for islet-specific transcription factors, enhancer regions, and different histone marks were enriched in the T2D-associated DMRs. We also identified 457 genes, including NR4A3, PARK2, PID1, SLC2A2, and SOCS2, that had both DMRs and significant expression changes in T2D islets. To mimic the situation in T2D islets, candidate genes were overexpressed or silenced in cultured β-cells. This resulted in impaired insulin secretion, thereby connecting differential methylation to islet dysfunction. We further explored the islet methylome and found a strong link between methylation levels and histone marks. Additionally, DNA methylation in different genomic regions and of different transcript types (i.e., protein coding, noncoding, and pseudogenes) was associated with islet expression levels. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the islet DNA methylome in individuals with and without diabetes and highlights the importance of epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets and T2D pathogenesis."

      "# Title: Sexual and reproductive health of migrants: does the EU care?\n# Abstract: The European Union (EU) refers to health as a human right in many internal and external communications, policies and agreements, defending its universality. In parallel, specific health needs of migrants originating from outside the EU have been acknowledged. Yet, their right to health and in particular sexual and reproductive health (SRH) is currently not ensured throughout the EU. This paper reflects on the results of a comprehensive literature review on migrants' SRH in the EU applying the Critical Interpretive Synthesis review method. We highlight the discrepancy between a proclaimed rights-based approach to health and actual obstacles to migrants' attainment of good SRH. Uncertainties on entitlements of diverse migrant groups are fuelled by unclear legal provisions, creating significant barriers to access health systems in general and SRH services in particular. Furthermore, the rare strategies addressing migrants' health fail to address sexual health and are generally limited to perinatal care and HIV screening. Thus, future European public health policy-making should not only strongly encourage its Member States to ensure equal access to health care for migrants as for EU citizens, but also promote migrants' SRH effectively through a holistic and inclusive approach in SRH policies, prevention and care.",
      "# Title: Evaluating the impact of immigration policies on health status among undocumented immigrants: a systematic review.\n# Abstract: Over the past two decades, new anti-immigration policies and laws have emerged to address the migration of undocumented immigrants. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to assess and understand how these immigration policies and laws may affect both access to health services and health outcomes among undocumented immigrants. Eight databases were used to conduct this review, which returned 325 papers that were assessed for validity based on specified inclusion criteria. Forty critically appraised articles were selected for analysis; thirty articles related to access to health services, and ten related to health outcomes. The articles showed a direct relationship between anti-immigration policies and their effects on access to health services. In addition, as a result of these policies, undocumented immigrants were impacted by mental health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Action items were presented, including the promotion of cultural diversity training and the development of innovative strategies to support safety-net health care facilities serving vulnerable populations.",

Papers using quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods designs, and samples with adult (≥18 years) migrants from low- and middle-income countries in high-income countries were included in the paper. Of 3155 papers retrieved, 31 met the inclusion criteria and are included in the review. A large number of barriers and facilitators to HIV testing were identified across the individual, social and structural levels. A number of study design and methodological issues, however, inhibited a comprehensive synthesis. There is no doubt that addressing HIV testing in migrants in high-income countries is complex; however, it has important implications for individual, community and population health, and a strong, empirically based response is warranted.",

      "# Title: What the eye does not see: a critical interpretive synthesis of European Union policies addressing sexual violence in vulnerable migrants.\n# Abstract: In Europe, refugees, asylum seekers and undocumented migrants are more vulnerable to sexual victimisation than European citizens. They face more challenges when seeking care. This literature review examines how legal and policy frameworks at national, European and international levels condition the prevention of and response to sexual violence affecting these vulnerable migrant communities living in the European Union (EU). Applying the Critical Interpretive Synthesis method, we reviewed 187 legal and policy documents and 80 peer-reviewed articles on migrant sexual health for elements on sexual violence and further analysed the 37 legal and 12 peer-reviewed articles among them that specifically focused on sexual violence in vulnerable migrants in the EU-27 States. Legal and policy documents dealing with sexual violence, particularly but not exclusively in vulnerable migrants, apply 'tunnel vision'. They ignore: a) frequently occurring types of sexual violence, b) victimisation rates across genders and c) specific risk factors within the EU such as migrants' legal status, gender orientation and living conditions. The current EU policy-making paradigm relegates sexual violence in vulnerable migrants as an 'outsider' and 'female only' issue while EU migration and asylum policies reinforce its invisibility. Effective response must be guided by participatory rights- and evidence-based policies and a public health approach, acknowledging the occurrence and multiplicity of sexual victimisation of vulnerable migrants of all genders within EU borders.",
      "# Title: Human Trafficking in Ethiopia: A Scoping Review to Identify Gaps in Service Delivery, Research, and Policy.\n# Abstract: The purpose of this review is to integrate evidence on human trafficking in Ethiopia and identify gaps and recommendations for service delivery, research and training, and policy. A scoping literature review approach was used to systematically search nursing, medical, psychological, law, and international databases and synthesize information on a complex, understudied topic. The search yielded 826 articles, and 39 met the predetermined criteria for inclusion in the review. Trafficking in Ethiopia has occurred internally and externally in the form of adult and child labor and sex trafficking. There were also some reports of organ trafficking and other closely related human rights violations, such as child marriage, child soldiering, and exploitative intercountry adoption. Risk factors for trafficking included push factors (poverty, political instability, economic problems, and gender discrimination) and pull factors (demand for cheap labor). Trafficking was associated with poor health and economic outcomes for victims. Key recommendations for service delivery, research and training, and policy are identified, including establishing comprehensive services for survivor rehabilitation and reintegration, conducting quantitative health outcomes research, and reforming policy around migration and trafficking. Implementing the recommendations identified by this review will allow policy makers, researchers, and practitioners to take meaningful steps toward confronting human trafficking in Ethiopia.",

      "# Title: Factors Influencing the Accuracy of Infectious Disease Reporting in Migrants: A Scoping Review.\n# Abstract: We conducted a scoping review of literature to improve our understanding of the accuracy of infectious disease monitoring in migrants in the Europe. We searched PubMed for papers relevant to the topic including: case reports, observational and experimental studies, reviews, guidelines or policy documents; published after 1994. We identified 532 papers, 27 of which were included in the review. Legislation and right to access health care influence both the accuracy of rates and risk measures under estimating the at risk population, i.e., the denominator. Furthermore, the number of reported cases, i.e., the numerator, may also include cases not accounted for in the denominator. Both biases lead to an overestimated disease occurrence. Restriction to healthcare access and low responsiveness may cause under-detection of cases, however a quantification of this phenomenon has not been produced. On the contrary, screening for asymptomatic diseases increases ascertainment leading to increased detection of cases. Incompleteness of denominator data underestimates the at-risk population. In conclusion, most studies show a lower probability of under-reporting infectious diseases in migrants compared with native populations."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the determinants and consequences of surveillance completeness. Patients who underwent endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair between October 1996 and August 2004 and enrolled in the EUROSTAR registry were analyzed. Two groups were compared: patients who attended all scheduled visits (group A) and those who came infrequently (group B). Odds ratios and hazard rates (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined to detect which patient characteristics and complications were associated with follow-up intensity. Of the 4,433 patients, 1,538 (35%) attended all scheduled visits until the end of follow-up (group A). Analysis of patient characteristics demonstrated that intensive visitors were more often smokers, hyperlipemic, and considered unfit for open surgery or general anesthesia.

However, BI-ALCL diagnosis on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) might be challenging for pathologists lacking experience with peri-implant breast effusions. Sixty-seven late breast implant seromas collected by FNA from 50 patients were evaluated by Papanicolaou smear stain and immunocytochemistry on cell blocks. A diagnostic algorithm based on the cellular composition, cell morphology and percentage of CD30+ cells was developed. Histological evaluation of the corresponding peri-prosthetic capsules was also performed. Most of the effusions (91% of the samples) were classified as reactive and 9% as BI-ALCL. In the BI-ALCL cases, medium-to-large atypical cells expressing CD30 represented more than 70% of the cellularity, whereas in in the reactive effusions CD30+ elements were extremely rare (<5%) and consisted of non-atypical elements. The reactive effusions were categorized into three patterns: i) acute infiltrate with prominent neutrophilic component (33% of the samples); ii) mixed infiltrate characterized by a variable number of neutrophils, lymphocytes and macrophages (30% of the samples); iii) chronic infiltrate composed predominantly of T lymphocytes or macrophages with only sporadic granulocytes (37% of the samples). The inflammatory cytological patterns were consistent with the histology of the corresponding capsules. Our results indicate that cytological analysis of late breast implant effusions, supported by the knowledge of the heterogeneous cytomorphological spectrum of late seromas, is a valuable approach for the early recognition of BI-ALCL.",

Its etiology unknown, one hypothesis suggests an initiating inflammatory stimulus, possibly infectious, triggers BIA-ALCL. We analyzed microbiota of breast, skin, implant and capsule in BIA-ALCL patients (n = 7), and controls via culturing methods, 16S rRNA microbiome sequencing, and immunohistochemistry. Alpha and beta diversity metrics and relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria were calculated, and phylogenetic trees constructed. Staphylococcus spp., the most commonly cultured microbes, were identified in both the BIA-ALCL and contralateral control breast. The diversity of bacterial microbiota did not differ significantly between BIA-ALCL and controls for any material analyzed. Further, there were no significant differences in the relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria between BIA-ALCL and control specimens. Heat maps suggested substantial diversity in the composition of the bacterial microbiota of the skin, breast, implant and capsule between patients with no clear trend to distinguish BIA-ALCL from controls. While we identified no consistent differences between patients with BIA-ALCL-affected and contralateral control breasts, this study provides insights into the composition of the breast microbiota in this population.",

We investigated whether bacteria could trigger the activation and multiplication of BIA-ALCL cells in vitro. BIA-ALCL patient-derived BIA-ALCL tumor cells, BIA-ALCL cell lines, cutaneous ALCL cell lines, an immortal T-cell line (MT-4), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from BIA-ALCL, capsular contracture, and primary augmentation patients were studied. Cells were subjected to various mitogenic stimulation assays including plant phytohemagglutinin (PHA), Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Staphylococcal superantigens enterotoxin A (SEA), toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), or sterilized implant shells. Patient-derived BIA-ALCL tumor cells and BIA-ALCL cell lines showed a unique response to LPS stimulation. This response was dampened significantly in the presence of a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) inhibitor peptide. In contrast, cutaneous ALCL cells, MT-4, and PBMC cells from all patients responded significantly more to PHA, SEA, and TSST-1 than to LPS. Breast implant shells of all surface grades alone did not produce a proliferative response of BIA-ALCL cells, indicating the breast implant does not act as a pro-inflammatory stimulant. These findings indicate a possible novel pathway for LPS to promote BIA-ALCL cell proliferation via a TLR4 receptor-mediated bacterial transformation of T-cells into malignancy."

Increased NLR (ΔNLR > 0) after 2 cycles of chemotherapy was associated with higher risk compared to ΔNLR ≤ 0 (multivariable HR = 1.894, P = 0.007).

Pre-conditioning may prevent severe EIMD and accelerate recovery of muscle force generation capacity. The current systematic review identified that pre-conditioning activities are effective in attenuating EIMD measures, CK, muscle soreness, ROM and maximal voluntary force production. These findings suggest the use of pre-conditioning activities prior to a strenuous bout of exercise does provide a significant protective effect when performed a minimum of 24 h prior to the damaging stimulus. Furthermore, the greater improvement in MVC suggests that the pre-conditioning activities may accelerate the recovery of muscle contractile properties following strenuous exercises.

Ten male subjects with a mean (+/- S.D.) age of 22.5 +/- 2.8 years, body mass of 62.67 +/- 0.05 kg and height of 176 +/- 3 cm were allocated to either a treatment group or a control group. The treatment group performed 100 maximal eccentric activations of the knee extensors in the dominant leg at 0.52 rad s-1. Two weeks later, the downhill run was performed on a motor-driven treadmill. This consisted of five bouts of 8 min at a gradient of -10% at a speed corresponding to 80% of the predicted maximal heart rate. The untrained group performed the downhill run as above but without the prior isokinetic session. Tenderness measurements, plasma CK activity and concentric and eccentric isokinetic peak torque measurements of the knee extensors at 0.52 and 2.83 rad s-1 were recorded prior to, immediately following and 2, 4 and 7 days after each protocol. The isokinetic protocol caused an increase (P < 0.01) in CK and tenderness and a decrease (P < 0.05) in concentric and eccentric torque at both speeds in the treatment group. Following the downhill run, a reduction in peak torque (P < 0.01) was observed in the eccentric and concentric modes at both isokinetic speeds in the control group. For the treatment group, the decrease in peak torque occurred only at the faster eccentric speed. With the exception of the faster eccentric speed, the decrement in peak torque was greater in the control group in all post-exercise isokinetic strength tests. There was less tenderness (P < 0.01) in the trained knee extensor muscle group. Peak torque also returned to pre-downhill values earlier for the trained group. Although plasma CK activity increased in both groups after downhill running, it was much lower (P < 0.01) in the trained group. The results suggest that a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric training reduces muscle damage, reduces the amount of strength loss and decreases the sensation of DOMS after downhill running.",
      "# Title: Exercise-induced skeletal muscle damage and adaptation following repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions.\n# Abstract: Repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions were used to examine indirect indices of exercise-induced muscle damage and adaptation in human skeletal muscle. Twenty-four subjects (18 females, 6 males) aged 20.0 +/- 1.4 years (mean +/- S.D.) performed an initial bout of either 10 (n = 7), 30 (n = 9) or 50 (n = 8) maximum voluntary eccentric contractions of the knee extensors, followed by a second bout of 50 contractions 3 weeks later using the same leg. Muscle soreness was elevated after all bouts (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon test), although the initial bout reduced the soreness associated with the second bout. Force loss and a decline in the 20:100 Hz percutaneous electrical myostimulation force ratio were observed after all exercise bouts (P < 0.01). Serum creatine kinase activity was elevated following the initial bouts of 30 and 50 repetitions (P < 0.01), but there was no increase following 10 repetitions. No increase in serum creatine kinase activity was observed in any group following the second bout of contractions (P > 0.05). We conclude that skeletal muscle adaptation can be brought about by a single bout of relatively few eccentric muscle contractions. Increasing the number of eccentric muscle repetitions did not result in an increased prophylactic effect on skeletal muscle.",
      "# Title: Influence of previous concentric exercise on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether a fatiguing concentric exercise performed immediately before eccentric exercise would exacerbate eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. One arm of nine female subjects (mean +/- s: 23.3 +/- 6.7 years) performed 12 maximal eccentric actions of the elbow flexors (ECC), and the other arm performed 100 repetitions of isokinetic concentric actions of the elbow flexors followed by the same eccentric exercise (CON-ECC). The two exercise regimens (ECC and CON-ECC) were separated by 2 weeks and presented in a counterbalanced order. Changes in muscle soreness level, maximal isometric force generation, relaxed and flexed elbow joint angle, upper arm circumference and plasma creatine kinase activity were compared between the ECC and CON-ECC conditions. All measures changed significantly after both ECC and CON-ECC; however, there were significant differences in the changes between the conditions. A lower level of soreness, a faster recovery of maximal isometric force generation, a smaller decrease in relaxed elbow joint angle and a smaller increase in upper arm circumference and creatine kinase activity were evident after the CON-ECC condition compared to the ECC condition. Thus, it would seem that muscle damage was attenuated by performance of previous concentric exercise. An additional experiment using a different group of subjects (n = 5) showed that warm-up exercise before the eccentric exercise also attenuated eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Acute adaptation to low volume eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: Many symptoms of eccentric muscle damage can be substantially reduced if a similar eccentric bout is repeated within several weeks of the initial bout. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a nondamaging, low repetition, low volume eccentric exercise bout could also provide a protective/adaptive effect.",
      "# Title: The repeated bout effect of reduced-load eccentric exercise on elbow flexor muscle damage.\n# Abstract: In this study we investigated the extent to which an initial eccentric exercise consisting of two (2ECC) or six maximal eccentric actions (6ECC) of the elbow flexors would produce a similar effect to 24 maximal eccentric actions (24ECC), on a second bout of 24ECC performed 2 weeks later. Male students (n = 34) were assigned to one of three groups, and with their non-dominant arm performed either 2ECC (n = 12), 6ECC (n = 10), or 24ECC (n = 12) as a first bout of exercise. Two weeks later all groups performed 24ECC. Maximal isometric strength, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration were assessed before, immediately after, and for 4 days after exercise. Changes in all variables were compared between the bouts and groups by a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance. All variables changed significantly (P< 0.05) after 2ECC, 6ECC, and 24ECC, but the amount of change after 2ECC and 6ECC was significantly smaller (P<0.05) than both 6ECC and 24ECC, and 24ECC, respectively. After the second bout, the 6ECC and 24ECC groups showed a profound repeated bout effect, and no significant differences were found between the groups. All variables except muscle soreness were significantly (P< 0.05) larger after the second bout for the 2ECC group, however the changes observed after 24ECC were significantly smaller (P < 0.01) than those observed after the first 24ECC of the 24ECC group. These results suggest that it is not necessary to conduct a high number of eccentric actions in the first bout to elicit a repeated bout effect in a subsequent bout performed some time later.",

      "# Title: Intensity of eccentric exercise, shift of optimum angle, and the magnitude of repeated-bout effect.\n# Abstract: This study compared the effect of four different intensities of initial eccentric exercise (ECC1) on optimum angle shift and extent of muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise. Fifty-two male students were placed into 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% groups (n = 13 per group), performing 30 eccentric actions of the elbow flexors of 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% of maximal isometric strength [maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)] for ECC1, followed 2-3 wk later by a similar exercise (ECC2) that used 100% MVC load. MVC at six elbow joint angles, range of motion, upper arm circumference, serum creatine kinase activity, myoglobin concentration, and muscle soreness were measured before and for 5 days following ECC1 and ECC2. A rightward shift of optimum angle following ECC1 was significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 100% and 80% than for the 60% and 40% groups, and it decreased significantly (P < 0.05) from immediately to 5 days postexercise. By the time ECC2 was performed, only the 100% group kept a significant shift (4 degrees). Changes in most of the criterion measures following ECC1 were significantly greater for the 100% and 80% groups compared with the 60% and 40% groups. Changes in the criterion measures following ECC2 were significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 40% group compared with other groups. Although the magnitude of repeated bout effect following ECC2 was significantly (P < 0.05) smaller for the 40% and 60% groups, all groups showed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced changes in criterion measures following ECC2 compared with the ECC1 100% bout. We conclude that the repeated-bout effect was not dependent on the shift of optimum angle.",
      "# Title: Repeated bout effect after maximal eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: We hypothesized that a bout of high or low volume eccentric exercise would protect against muscle damage following a subsequent high volume bout and that adaptation would be attributable to neural changes, independent of the initial exercise volume. Sixteen males performed either 45 (ECC45) or 10 (ECC10) maximal eccentric contractions using the elbow flexors, followed by an ECC45 bout 2 weeks later. Damage markers were measured for the following 96 h; EMG and work done during the first 10 eccentric contractions were also recorded. CK, soreness, and decrements in MVC and range of motion (ROM) were greater in bout 1 than bout 2 (p < 0.01). Soreness, MVC and ROM were greater after the initial ECC45 bout compared to the initial ECC10 bout and the repeated bouts of ECC45 exercise in both groups (p < 0.01). Median frequency decreased from bout 1 to bout 2 (p < 0.001), no differences between groups were observed. An ECC45 bout of maximal eccentric exercise causes more initial damage than an ECC10 bout of maximal eccentric exercise, although both confer protection from subsequent ECC45 bouts of maximal eccentric contractions, which are attributable, at least in part, to a shift in the frequency content of EMG.",
      "# Title: A light load eccentric exercise confers protection against a subsequent bout of more demanding eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that a light eccentric exercise (ECC) that does not induce a loss of muscle function and delayed onset muscle soreness would confer a protective effect against a more strenuous ECC. Eighteen young men were randomly placed into two groups: 10-40% (n=9) and 40% (n=9). Subjects in the 10-40% group performed ECC of the elbow flexors (six sets of five reps) using a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (MVC) at an elbow joint angle of 90 degrees , followed 2 days later by ECC using a dumbbell weight of 40% MVC. Subjects in the 40% group performed the 40% ECC only. Changes in MVC, range of motion (ROM), upper arm circumference (CIR), plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and muscle soreness before, immediately after, 1-5 and 7 days following the 40% ECC were compared between groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any of the criterion measures were found immediately and 1-2 days after the 10% ECC. Following the 40% ECC, the 10-40% group showed significantly (P<0.05) smaller decreases in MVC and ROM, and smaller increases in muscle soreness compared with the 40% group, but no significant differences between groups were evident for CIR and plasma CK activity. These results suggest that the 10% ECC induced some protection against a subsequent bout of 40% ECC performed 2 days later. It appears that the light eccentric exercise preconditioned the muscles for exposure to the subsequent damaging eccentric exercise bout.",
      "# Title: Protection against muscle damage following fifty drop jumps conferred by ten drop jumps.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether 10 drop jumps (DJs) would confer protective effect against muscle damage and soreness in a subsequent bout of 50 DJs. Sixteen men were randomly placed into either a group performing 1 set of 10 DJs followed by 5 sets of 10 DJs (10-50, n = 8) or another group performing 2 bouts of 5 sets of 10 DJs (50-50, n = 8) separated by 2 weeks. The DJs were performed from a box height of 0.6 m, with a 10-second interval between jumps and a 1-minute rest between sets. Jump height, peak vertical ground reaction force, ground contact time, and heart rate during DJs were measured, and blood lactate concentration was assessed before and immediately after DJs. Changes in maximal isometric (ISO) and isokinetic concentric torque (CON), vertical jump, muscle soreness, and plasma creatine kinase activity before, immediately after, and at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours following exercise were compared between groups for the first and second bouts and between the bouts by a 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance. Changes in ISO, CON, vertical jump, and muscle soreness were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller for 10 DJs compared with 50 DJs; however, no significant differences in the measures between groups were evident following the second bout. The changes in the measures following 50 DJs in the 10-50 group were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller than those following the first bout of the 50-50 group. These results suggest that 10 DJs and 50 DJs conferred the same magnitude of protective effect against muscle damage by 50 DJs.",
      "# Title: Muscle damage protection by low-intensity eccentric contractions remains for 2 weeks but not 3 weeks.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that the protective effect conferred by a low-intensity eccentric exercise against maximal eccentric exercise would not last more than a week. Untrained men (21.3 ± 1.6 years) were allocated into either a control or one of four repeated bout groups (n = 13 per group). The repeated bout groups performed 30 low-intensity eccentric contractions (ECC) of the elbow flexors with a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (10%-ECC) either 2 days, 7 days (1 week), 14 days (2 weeks) or 21 days (3 weeks) before 30 maximal eccentric contractions (Max-ECC). The control group performed Max-ECC only. Changes in maximal voluntary contraction strength, optimum angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following 10%-ECC were analysed by a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Changes in the variables following Max-ECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. The 10%-ECC did not change any variables, showing no indication of muscle damage. The changes in all variables following Max-ECC were smaller (P < 0.05) for 2-day, 1- and 2-week groups than control group, without significant differences between 2-day and 1-week groups. The 2-week group showed greater (P < 0.05) changes in all variables compared with 2-day and 1-week groups. Changes in the variables were similar between 3-week and control groups, except for muscle soreness showing smaller (P < 0.05) changes for 3-week group. These results suggest that non-damaging eccentric exercise confers a protective effect against Max-Ecc, but the effect is attenuated between 1 and 2 weeks.",
      "# Title: Two maximal isometric contractions attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVC-ISO) would attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. Young untrained men were placed into one of the two experimental groups or one control group (n = 13 per group). Subjects in the experimental groups performed either two or 10 MVC-ISO of the elbow flexors at a long muscle length (20° flexion) 2 days prior to 30 maximal isokinetic eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors. Subjects in the control group performed the eccentric contractions without MVC-ISO. No significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction peak torque, peak torque angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and myoglobin concentration, muscle soreness, and ultrasound echo intensity were evident after MVC-ISO. Changes in the variables following eccentric contractions were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2 MVC-ISO group (e.g., peak torque loss at 5 days after exercise, 23% ± 3%; peak CK activity, 1964 ± 452 IU·L(-1); peak muscle soreness, 46 ± 4 mm) or the 10 MVC-ISO group (13% ± 3%, 877 ± 198 IU·L(-1), 30 ± 4 mm) compared with the control (34% ± 4%, 6192 ± 1747 IU·L(-1), 66 ± 5 mm). The 10 MVC-ISO group showed smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following eccentric contractions compared with the 2 MVC-ISO group. Therefore, two MVC-ISO conferred potent protective effects against muscle damage, whereas greater protective effect was induced by 10 MVC-ISO, which can be used as a strategy to minimize muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Attenuation of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage by preconditioning exercises.\n# Abstract: This study compared the effect of an initial exercise consisting of either low-intensity eccentric or maximal isometric contractions (ISOs) on protective effect against maximal eccentric contraction (MaxECC)-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions attenuate muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise of the knee extensors in the elderly.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors would attenuate the magnitude of muscle damage induced by maximal eccentric exercise of the same muscle performed 7 days later using elderly individuals. Healthy older men (66.4 ± 4.6 years) were assigned to control or experimental (Exp) group (n = 13 per group). The control group performed six sets of ten maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC) of the knee extensors of non-dominant leg. The Exp group performed six sets of ten low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors on a leg extension machine by lowering a weight of 10 % maximal voluntary isometric knee extension strength (10 %ECC) 7 days prior to MaxECC. Changes in maximal voluntary isokinetic concentric torque (MVC-CON), angle at peak torque, range of motion (ROM), upper thigh circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin (Mb) concentration and B-mode ultrasound echo-intensity before and for 5 days after MaxECC were compared between groups by a mixed factor ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were observed following 10 %ECC. Following MaxECC, all variables changed significantly, and changes in all variables except for angle at peak torque were significantly different between groups. MVC-CON and ROM decreased smaller and recovered faster (P < 0.05) for Exp than control group, and changes in other variables were smaller (P < 0.05) for Exp group compared with control group. These results suggest that preconditioning knee extensor muscles with low-intensity eccentric contractions was effective for attenuating muscle damage induced by subsequent MaxECC of the knee extensors for elderly individuals.",
      "# Title: Effect of two maximal isometric contractions on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the elbow flexors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the time wise protective effect conferred by two maximal voluntary isometric contractions (2MVCs) at 20° elbow flexion on muscle damage induced by 30 maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors (MaxECC). Sixty-five young untrained men were randomly assigned to a control group that did not perform 2MVCs, or one of four experimental groups (n = 13 per group) who performed 2MVCs either immediately (0d), 2 (2d), 4 (4d) or 7 days (7d) before MaxECC. Changes in maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) concentric torque (MVC-CON), optimum angle (OA), range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following MaxECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were evident following 2MVCs. The 2d and 4d groups showed 16-62 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following MaxECC than the control, 0d and 7d groups. The 2d group showed 14-34 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables except for OA compared with the 4d group. The changes in the variables were similar among the control, 0d and 7d groups. These results show that 2MVCs that were performed between 2 and 4 days before MaxECC attenuated the magnitude of muscle damage, but no such effect was evident if the 2MVCs were performed immediately or 7 days before MaxECC. It is concluded that the protective effect conferred by 2MVCs is relatively short-lived, and there is a window for the effect to be conferred.",
      "# Title: Effect of a prior bout of preconditioning exercise on muscle damage from downhill walking.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether reduced-duration downhill walking (DW) would confer a protective effect against muscle damage induced by a subsequent bout of longer duration DW performed 1 week or 4 weeks later. Healthy young adults were allocated to a control or one of the preconditioning exercise (PRE-1wk or PRE-4wk) groups (10 men and 4 women per group). PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups performed 20-min DW (-28% slope, 5 km/h, 10% body mass added to a backpack) 1 week and 4 weeks before 40-min DW, respectively, and the control group performed 40-min DW only. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) knee extension torque, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity, and muscle soreness (100-mm visual analog scale) were measured before, immediately after, and 24, 48, and 72 h after DW, and the changes in these variables were compared among groups. The control group showed symptoms of muscle damage (e.g., prolonged decrease in MVC: -14% ± 10% at 48 h post-DW) after 40-min DW. Changes in all variables after 40-min DW of PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups were 54%-61% smaller (P < 0.05) than the control group, without significant differences between PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups for MVC and plasma CK activity. Importantly, changes after the preconditioning exercise (20-min DW) were 67%-69% smaller (P < 0.05) than those after the 40-min DW of the control group. These findings suggest that 20-min DW resulting in minor muscle damage conferred a protective effect against subsequent 40-min DW, and its effect could last for more than 4 weeks.",

      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors and flexors protect against muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the magnitude and duration of the protective effect of low-intensity eccentric contractions (LowEC) against damage induced by maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) of the knee flexors (KF) and extensors (KE). Young men were assigned to 8 experimental groups and 2 control groups (n = 13/group); the experimental groups performed LowEC of KF or KE 2 days (2d), 1 week (1wk), 2 weeks (2wk), or 3 weeks (3wk) before MaxEC, while the control groups performed MaxEC of KF or KE without LowEC. The 2d, 1wk, 2wk, and 3wk groups performed 30 LowEC of KF or 60 LowEC of KE with a load of 10% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction strength on a resistance-training machine, and all groups performed 30 MaxEC of KF or 60 MaxEC of KE on an isokinetic dynamometer. Several muscle damage markers were measured from before to 2 days after exercise (LowEC) or from before to 5 days after exercise (MaxEC). No significant changes in any variables were evident after LowEC. The changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2d and 1wk groups (e.g., peak creatine kinase activity: 1002 ± 501 IU/L; peak muscle soreness: 13 ± 5 mm) than for the control group (peak creatine kinase activity: 3005 ± 983 IU/L; peak muscle soreness 28 ± 6 mm) for both KE and KF. There were no significant differences between the 2d and 1wk groups or among the 2wk, 3wk, and control groups. These results show that LowEC provided 30%-66% protection against damage induced by MaxEC of KF and KE, and the protective effect lasted 1 week.",
      "# Title: Protective effect by maximal isometric contractions against maximal eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the knee extensors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) performed before maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) would attenuate muscle damage of the knee extensors. Untrained men were placed to an experimental group that performed 6 sets of 10 MVIC at 90° knee flexion 2 weeks before 6 sets of 10 MaxEC or a control group that performed MaxEC only (n = 13/group). Changes in muscle damage markers were assessed before to 5 days after each exercise. Small but significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction torque, range of motion (ROM) and plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity were evident at immediately to 2 days post-MVIC (p < 0.05), but other variables (e.g. thigh girth, myoglobin concentration, B-mode echo intensity) did not change significantly. Changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (p < 0.05) by 45% (soreness)-67% (CK) for the experimental than the control group. These results suggest that MVIC conferred potent protective effect against MaxEC-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Prevention of downhill walking-induced muscle damage by non-damaging downhill walking.\n# Abstract: Mountain trekking involves level, uphill, and downhill walking (DW). Prolonged DW induces damage to leg muscles, reducing force generating ability and muscle coordination. These increase risks for more serious injuries and accidents in mountain trekking, thus a strategy to minimize muscle damage is warranted. It has been shown that low-intensity eccentric contractions confer protective effect on muscle damage induced by high-intensity eccentric contractions. This study tested the hypothesis that 5-min non-damaging DW would attenuate muscle damage induced by 40-min DW, but 5-min level walking (LW) would not.",
      "# Title: Isometric pre-conditioning blunts exercise-induced muscle damage but does not attenuate changes in running economy following downhill running.\n# Abstract: Running economy (RE) is impaired following unaccustomed eccentric-biased exercises that induce muscle damage. It is also known that muscle damage is reduced when maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) are performed at a long muscle length 2-4 days prior to maximal eccentric exercise with the same muscle, a phenomenon that can be described as isometric pre-conditioning (IPC). We tested the hypothesis that IPC could attenuate muscle damage and changes in RE following downhill running. Thirty untrained men were randomly assigned into experimental or control groups and ran downhill on a treadmill (-15%) for 30 min. Participants in the experimental group completed 10 MVIC in a leg press machine two days prior to downhill running, while participants in the control group did not perform IPC. The magnitude of changes in muscle soreness determined 48 h after downhill running was greater for the control group (122 ± 28 mm) than for the experimental group (92 ± 38 mm). Isometric peak torque recovered faster in the experimental group compared with the control group (3 days vs. no full recovery, respectively). No significant effect of IPC was found for countermovement jump height, serum creatine kinase activity or any parameters associated with RE. These results supported the hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in markers of muscle damage. The hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in RE was not supported by our data. It appears that the mechanisms involved in changes in markers of muscle damage and parameters associated with RE following downhill running are not completely shared.",
      "# Title: Damage protective effects conferred by low-intensity eccentric contractions on arm, leg and trunk muscles.\n# Abstract: Low-intensity eccentric contractions with a load corresponding to 10% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction strength (10% EC) attenuate muscle damage in a subsequent bout of higher-intensity eccentric contractions performed within 2 weeks for the elbow flexors, knee flexors and knee extensors. However, it is not known whether this strategy could be applied to other muscles. This study investigated whether 10% EC would confer damage protective effect on high-intensity eccentric contractions (80% EC) for nine different muscle groups.",
      "# Title: Protective Effect Conferred by Isometric Preconditioning Against Slow- and Fast-Velocity Eccentric Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage.\n# Abstract: We investigated if the same isometric preconditioning protocol (IPP) attenuates the magnitude of muscle damage induced by different maximal eccentric exercise protocols in the elbow flexors. Sixty-four untrained men were assigned to either two experimental or two control groups. Participants in the experimental groups performed an IPP prior to either slow (60°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-S) or fast (180°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-F) maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC). Subjects in the control groups performed slow (ECC-S) or fast (ECC-F) MaxECC without IPP. Maximal isokinetic concentric torque (MVC), muscle soreness (SOR), and muscle thickness (MT) were assessed before, immediately after, and 1-4 days following the MaxECC. Significant (p < 0.05) group vs. time interactions were found for MVC (F = 4,517), SOR (F = 6,318), and MT (F = 1,863). The ECC-S group presented faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and MT and less (p < 0.05) SOR at 96 h post-MaxECC compared with ECC-F group. No significant differences in MVC and MT were found between ECC-S and ECC-F groups following MaxECC. The ISO + ECC-S group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and SOR compared to the ECC-S group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ECC-S in any variable. The ISO + ECC-F group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of all assessed variables compared with the ECC-F group. MVC was greater (p < 0.05) at 48-72 h, and SOR was less (p < 0.05) at 48-96 h in the ISO + ECC-F compared to the ECC-F group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ISO + ECC-F for any variable. These results show that the IPP accelerated recovery of MVC and SOR for the slow-eccentric exercise condition and attenuated strength loss and SOR in addition to faster recovery of all assessed variables for the fast-eccentric exercise condition. Therefore, the IPP can be used as a strategy to attenuate and accelerate recovery of muscle damage induced by different-velocity eccentric exercises, resulting in greater protection against muscle damage induced by faster velocity."

      "conclusionA": "Performing a prior bout of low-to-moderate volume eccentric or isometric exercise—even as little as two maximal isometric contractions or 10-50 eccentric actions—significantly attenuates subsequent exercise-induced muscle damage, typically within a window of 1-2 weeks, regardless of exercise modality (downhill walking, elbow flexors, knee extensors) or contraction velocity; however, this protective effect is not sustained beyond 2-3 weeks.",
      "conclusionB": "Eccentric exercise, performed at a submaximal intensity, currently stands out as the most effective pre-conditioning strategy for reducing Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage (EIMD); however, the magnitude of this effect is significantly moderated by participant characteristics – notably training status and sex – and the specific muscle group targeted, necessitating individualized and nuanced application of pre-conditioning protocols."

      "# Title: Thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications in essential thrombocythemia. A retrospective study of 103 patients.\n# Abstract: A retrospective study of 103 patients with essential thrombocythemia was carried out to evaluate the incidence of thrombohemorrhagic complications and establish whether there were any correlations between these events and clinical or laboratory data. At onset or during the course of the disease, 26 patients (25.2%) presented thrombotic and 12 (11.6%) hemorrhagic complications: among the latter, six patients had gastrointestinal bleeding during antiaggregant therapy. No significant correlations were observed between thrombohemorrhagic complications and platelet count, age, sex, platelet function, bleeding time, or therapeutic regimen. However, there was a statistically significant correlation between a positive patient history for thrombotic events and an increase in thromboses. In agreement with other authors, it is believed that the best approach in asymptomatic patients is strict surveillance without treatment. Chemotherapy and/or treatment with antiaggregant agents should be reserved for symptomatic patients or patients with a positive history for thrombotic events.",
      "# Title: Clinical course of essential thrombocythemia in 147 cases.\n# Abstract: The authors retrospectively analyzed the initial characteristics, treatment, and clinical course in 147 patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET). Median age was 60 years and the M:F ratio was 0.69. At diagnosis, 53 patients were asymptomatic; 50 patients had functional symptoms (mainly vasomotor disturbances); 27 patients had large vessel thrombosis; 27 patients had a bleeding diathesis; and seven patients had both bleeding and thrombosis. The platelet count ranged from 0.7 to 2.92 X 10(12)/l. Forty-five of the 61 tested patients (61%) had prolonged bleeding time and/or platelet hypoaggregation. Three patients had in vitro spontaneous aggregation. No significant correlations were found between hemostatic findings and in vivo bleeding or thrombosis. The incidence of bleeding, however, was higher in patients with more than 2 x 10(12)/l platelets. Of 87 karyotypes performed with banding techniques, only four were abnormal. One hundred twenty-nine patients received one or more cytoreductive agents at diagnosis or during follow-up. Sixty patients received an antiaggregating agent. First-line therapy was radiophosphorus (32P) in 22 patients; busulfan in 35 patients; and hydroxyurea in 72 patients. Hydroxyurea required continuous maintenance therapy and had to be changed to another treatment in 12 of the initial responders because of inadequate control of thrombocythemia. During follow-up, 14 treated patients experienced one or several major thrombotic events. Two untreated patients also had major thrombosis. Only one major bleeding event was seen during follow-up. Median actuarial survival was 73.5% at 7 years and only one patient progressed to acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). These results suggest that large vessel thrombosis is the main complication of ET. It appears largely unpredictable in a given patient at diagnosis but can be largely prevented by the control of thrombocythemia. Because of the low incidence of side effects of treatment in this experience, the authors believe that cytoreductive therapy is indicated in most patients with ET, as long as a group of patients with very low risk of thrombosis is not defined in prospective studies.",
      "# Title: Major vascular complications in essential thrombocythemia: a study of the predictive factors in a series of 148 patients.\n# Abstract: To determine the clinicohematological factors predictive for the appearance of major vascular complications (MVC) in patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET), 148 consecutive such patients were retrospectively assessed for the development of MVC during a median follow-up of 58.5 months. Seventy-seven patients had vascular risk factors, and 37 a history of MVC at ET diagnosis. Forty-nine MVC were registered in 33 patients during the follow-up period. The actuarial probability of MVC was 27% at 6 years in the whole series, 35.6% for patients above 60 years, and 21.4% for patients younger than 60 years, whereas only one of the 36 patients younger than 45 years had MVC. At multivariate analysis, age >60 years, history of major ischemia and hypercholesterolemia were the variables associated with an increased MVC risk. These results suggest that all ET patients above 60 years should be treated, whereas in younger patients treatment decisions should be primarily based on the existence of risk factors for MVC.",
      "# Title: Thrombosis and bleeding in myeloproliferative disorders: identification of at-risk patients with whole blood platelet aggregation studies.\n# Abstract: Seventy-five patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders were studied to investigate platelet function by simultaneous measurement of platelet aggregation by the impedance method and ATP dense granule release using a whole blood platelet lumi-aggregometer, in an attempt to identify patients at risk for thrombosis and bleeding. Thirty-nine patients had at least one abnormal result indicating platelet hyperactivity (i.e. impedance or release with one agonist being above the reference range); 16 patients had platelet hypoactivity (i.e. at least one result was below the reference range), whilst 14 had co-existence of hyper- and hypoactivity. Six patients had normal results. 20/53 patients with platelet hyperactivity (alone or mixed) had a positive history of venous and/or arterial thrombosis; in comparison, only two of the other 22 patients had a positive history. During a median follow-up of 33 months, nine patients with and one patient without platelet hyperactivity respectively developed new thrombotic events before the addition of specific therapy. A total of 50 patients with and eight patients without platelet hyperactivity respectively received specific treatment including aspirin and/or cytotoxic therapy. All but one elderly patient with platelet hyperactivity have remained free of new thrombotic events on specific therapy. Two of the 17 patients with platelet hypoactivity had major clinical bleeding. These observations highlight the need to test platelets for hyper- as well as hypo-function and suggest a useful role for routine whole blood platelet aggregation studies to identify the patients at risk for thrombosis or bleeding.",
      "# Title: Incidence, clinical features and outcome of essential thrombocythaemia in a well defined geographical area.\n# Abstract: In an attempt to characterise the clinical features, incidence and outcome of essential thrombocythaemia (ET) we report our experience in a large unselected series of patients from a well defined region. All new cases of ET in the County of Copenhagen were registered during the period 1977-98. We identified 96 cases of ET, yielding an age- and sex-adjusted annual incidence rate of 0.59/100.000 and a point-prevalence at last follow up of 11/100.000. The overall incidence rate was 0.31 and 1.00 per 100.000 population during the consecutive periods 1977-89 and 1990-98, respectively, corresponding to a 3.2-fold increase. Median age at diagnosis was 67 yr (females 68 yr, males 66 yr, range 18-87 yr), and the female to male (F/M) ratio was 2.6:1. At diagnosis, 52% of the patients displayed no ET-related symptoms and were discovered fortuitously by a routine platelet count. Forty-eight percent presented with thrombohaemorrhagic phenomena, of which microvascular disturbances of the central nervous system (CNS), extremities and skin were most frequently observed (23%). Compared to patients diagnosed after 1989, patients diagnosed before 1990 had a significantly higher mean platelet count, white blood cell (WBC) count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) value and alkaline phosphatase value. With a median follow up of 70 months, 5-yr survival was 76%, significantly lower than the expected survival of an age- and sex-matched control group (p = 0.0052). Thirty-seven patients experienced a total of 55 thrombohaemorrhagic events during follow-up, corresponding to an incidence of thrombosis and microvascular disturbances or haemorrhage of 8.1% per pt-yr and 2.5% per pt-yr, respectively. The number of patients experiencing thrombosis or microvascular disturbances was significantly higher among the 29 patients who never received acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) compared to the 67 patients who received ASA during follow up (45% vs. 21%; p = 0.017). This study provides population-based data suggesting the benefit of treatment with low-dose ASA in a non-selected population of patients with ET.",

      "# Title: Frequency and risk factors for thrombosis in idiopathic myelofibrosis: analysis in a series of 155 patients from a single institution.\n# Abstract: Thrombosis is a frequent complication of polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia, but its incidence and predisposing factors in idiopathic myelofibrosis (IM) are unknown. In 18 (11.6%) of 155 patients diagnosed with IM in a single institution, 31 thrombotic events (19 arterial, 12 venous) were registered after a mean follow-up of 4.2 (s.d.: 4.5) years. In six patients, the thrombosis was simultaneous to or appeared a few months before IM diagnosis and 14 had one or more thrombotic episodes. When compared with the general population, a significant increase was observed in the incidence of venous thrombosis (odds ratio 17.5, 95% confidence interval: 10.3-31.4). At multivariate analysis, the initial variables associated with an increased risk of thrombosis were thrombocytosis (platelets >450 x 10(9)/l, P=0.001), presence of one cardiovascular risk factor (arterial hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes, P=0.003), cellular phase of myelofibrosis (P=0.005), and Hb >11 g/dl (P=0.02). Considering post-diagnosis events, the 5-year thrombosis-free survival probability was 90.4% in the series, 80.6% for patients with platelets >450 x 10(9)/l, 82.6% for patients with one cardiovascular risk factor, and 85.1% for those in cellular phase. These results indicate an increased thrombotic risk for IM patients with hyperproliferative features and/or coexistent cardiovascular risk factors.",

      "# Title: Leukocytosis is a risk factor for thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia: interaction with treatment, standard risk factors, and Jak2 mutation status.\n# Abstract: Leukocytes contribute to the pathogenesis of thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia (ET) through recently discovered mechanisms of activation and interaction with platelets and endothelial cells. To evaluate whether an increased leukocyte count was associated with thrombosis and whether this effect can be modulated by therapy, we analyzed the clinical course of 439 patients with ET followed at the Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo. The strength of the association was measured at diagnosis or before thrombotic events by multivariable analyses carried out using data at baseline as well as time-varying covariates. The results showed that (1) an increased leukocyte count at diagnosis was associated with thrombosis during follow-up (\"baseline analysis,\" relative risk [RR] 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-3.9, P = .001); (2) hydroxyurea (HU) lowered leukocytosis and reduced the strength of the association between leukocytosis and thrombosis (\"time-dependent analysis,\" RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.9-2.0, not significant [NS]); (3) the association of leukocytosis and thrombosis was more evident in untreated low-risk patients (RR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-6.4, P = .01) compared with HU-treated high-risk patients (RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.8-3.2, NS); and (4) the presence of JAK2 V617F was not identified as a risk factor for thrombosis during follow-up despite a significant association between the mutation and leukocytosis. We suggest validation of these findings in prospective clinical studies.",
      "# Title: Clinical profile of homozygous JAK2 617V>F mutation in patients with polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia.\n# Abstract: JAK2 617V>F mutation occurs in a homozygous state in 25% to 30% of patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and 2% to 4% with essential thrombocythemia (ET). Whether homozygosity associates with distinct clinical phenotypes is still under debate. This retrospective multicenter study considered 118 JAK2 617V>F homozygous patients (104 PV, 14 ET) whose clinical characteristics were compared with those of 587 heterozygous and 257 wild-type patients. Irrespective of their clinical diagnosis, homozygous patients were older, displayed a higher leukocyte count and hematocrit value at diagnosis, and presented larger spleen volume. Aquagenic pruritus was significantly more common among homozygous PV patients. JAK2 617V>F homozygosity associated with more frequent evolution into secondary myelofibrosis in both PV and ET. After adjustment for sex, age, leukocyte count, and previous thrombosis in a multivariate analysis, homozygous ET patients displayed a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio [HR] 3.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-11.7; P = .013) than wild-type (HR = 1.0) or heterozygous patients (HR = 1.49). No significant association of JAK2 617V>F homozygosity with thrombosis risk was observed in PV. Finally, JAK2 617V>F homozygous patients were more likely to receive chemotherapy for control of disease. We conclude that JAK2 617V>F homozygosity identifies PV or ET patients with a more symptomatic myeloproliferative disorder and is associated with a higher risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with ET.",
      "# Title: Vascular events in Korean patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and their relationship to JAK2 mutation.\n# Abstract: Evaluation of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F mutation has been widely used for the diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). However, its prognostic relevance to clinical outcome is not completely understood. We investigated the association of JAK2 V617F with vascular events in Korean patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). We studied 283 patients from 15 centers, who were diagnosed with MPN. The JAK2 V617F status was evaluated by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. The patients' diagnoses were essential thrombocythemia (ET n = 146), polycythemia vera (PV n = 120), primary myelofibrosis (n = 12), and unclassifiable MPN (MPNu n = 5). JAK2 V617F was detected in 89 (61%) patients with ET, 103 (86%) with PV, four (33%) with myelofibrosis, and four (80%) with MPNu. A higher number of leukocytes, haemoglobin levels and BM cellularity as well as an older age, lower platelet counts, and diagnosis of PV were significantly correlated with JAK2 V617F. Eighty-three and 43 episodes of thrombosis and bleeding occurred in 100 patients each before and after the diagnosis. Vascular events more frequently occurred in 37% of patients with JAK2 V617F than in 29% of those without the mutation (p = 0.045). Among 175 patients whose samples were available for sequencing, 28 patients with homozygous JAK2 V617F had vascular events more frequently (57%) than those who were heterozygotes (39%) or had the wild type (27%) (p = 0.03). The multivariate analysis showed that a JAK2 homozygous mutation, hypercholesterolemia and older age were independent risk factors for a vascular event. The results of this study showed that Korean patients with MPN had a similar JAK2 mutation rate and frequency of vascular events when compared to Western patients. The presence of V617F was significantly related to vascular events. Therefore, initial evaluation for the JAK2 mutation and careful monitoring for vascular events should be performed in MPN patients.",
      "# Title: Thrombosis in primary myelofibrosis: incidence and risk factors.\n# Abstract: We assessed frequency and predictive factors for major cardiovascular (CV) events in 707 patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) followed in 4 European institutions. A total of 236 deaths (33%) were recorded for an overall mortality of 7.7% patient-years (pt-yr). Fatal and nonfatal thromboses were registered in 51 (7.2%) patients, with a rate of 1.75% pt-yr. If deaths from non-CV causes were considered as competing events, we estimated that the adjusted rate of major thrombotic events would have been 2.2% pt-yr. In a multivariable model, age older than 60 years (hazard ratio [HR], 2.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-4.39, P = .01) and JAK2 mutational status (HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.10-3.34; P = .02) were significantly associated with thrombosis, whereas the strength of the association between leukocyte count higher than 15 x 10(9)/L and CV events was of borderline significance (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 0.97-2.72; P = .06). The highest incidence of fatal and nonfatal thrombosis was observed when the mutation was present along with leukocytosis (3.9% pt-yr; HR, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.26-7.81). This study is the largest hitherto carried out in this setting and shows that the rate of major CV events in PMF is comparable with that reported in essential thrombocythemia, and it is increased in aged patients and those with JAK2 V617F mutation and leukocytosis.",
      "# Title: Thrombosis in myelofibrosis: prior thrombosis is the only predictive factor and most venous events are provoked.\n# Abstract: In a retrospective analysis of 205 patients (median age 62 years) with primary myelofibrosis and known JAK2V617F mutational status, 13.2% experienced a vaso-occlusive event at or prior to their diagnosis. After a median follow up of 31 months, post-diagnosis thrombosis occurred in 22 patients (10.7%), including 9 (4.4%) and 16 (7.8%) patients with a total of 9 arterial and 24 venous events, respectively. The majority (71%) of the venous events were temporally associated with other exogenous risk factors for thrombosis such as surgery, line placement or hormonal therapy. On multivariable analysis that included age, JAK2V617F mutation status and leukocyte count as covariates, history of thrombosis was the only predictive variable in general (P=0.04) or when arterial (P=0.007) and venous (P=0.02) thromboses were analyzed separately. The current study demonstrates a higher prevalence of venous, as opposed to arterial, events in PMF, post-diagnosis, and clarifies their nature as being mostly provoked.",
      "# Title: Impact of leukocytosis on thrombotic risk and survival in 532 patients with essential thrombocythemia: a retrospective study.\n# Abstract: Established risk factors for thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia (ET) include age (≥ 60 years) and previous vascular events. Recently, also leukocytosis has been proposed in risk stratification of ET patients. We report a retrospective study on 532 ET patients followed for a median of 7.6 years. Sixty-four patients (12%) developed 95 thrombotic events during follow-up. Together with the high-risk condition, a white blood cell (WBC) value above 11 × 10⁹/L, corresponding to the fourth percentile value, significantly correlated with a higher thrombotic risk (p = 0.033) by Cox proportional hazards. Moreover, the cumulative risk of thrombosis was significantly higher in high-risk patients with WBC >11 × 10⁹/L. JAK2 V617F mutation did not correlate with thrombosis. Overall, 123 (23%) patients died. Three independent parameters were noted as prognostic factors for survival in multivariate analysis: age > 60 years, leukocytosis >11 × 10⁹/L, and hemoglobin level below normal values. Based on these parameters, three groups of risk were defined, with significantly different survivals. Baseline leukocytosis correlated with a higher thrombotic risk in high-risk patients and identified a cohort of patients with worse survival.",
      "# Title: Incidence and risk factors for bleeding in 1104 patients with essential thrombocythemia or prefibrotic myelofibrosis diagnosed according to the 2008 WHO criteria.\n# Abstract: In an international study of 1104 patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET), a histological review according to the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria confirmed ET in 891 patients (WHO-ET, 81%), and revised the diagnosis to prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis (PMF) in 180 patients (PMF, 16%). Major bleeding during follow-up occurred in 55 (6%) WHO-ET and 21 (12%) PMF patients (P = 0.009), at a rate of 0.79 and 1.39% patients per year, respectively, (P = 0.039). In a multivariable analysis, predictors of bleeding included diagnosis of PMF (P = 0.05; hazard ratio (HR) 1.74), leukocytosis (P = 0.04; HR 1.74), previous hemorrhage (P = 0.025; HR 2.35) and aspirin therapy (P=0.001; HR 3.16). The analysis restricted to patients with WHO-ET confirmed previous hemorrhage (P = 0.043; HR 1.92) and aspirin (P=0.027; HR 2.24) as independent risk factors. The current study reveals that major bleeding associated with thrombocytosis might be relatively specific to PMF, as opposed to WHO-defined ET. Furthermore, it shows that low-dose aspirin exacerbates these hemorrhagic events of PMF. In contrast, thrombocytosis per se was not a risk factor for bleeding; however, low-dose aspirin had a synergistic hemorrhagic effect unmasking the bleeding tendency of patients with extreme thrombocytosis. These observations carry significant therapeutic implications in these two WHO entities.",
      "# Title: Leukocytosis as an important risk factor for arterial thrombosis in WHO-defined early/prefibrotic myelofibrosis: an international study of 264 patients.\n# Abstract: We aimed to determine risk factors for thrombotic events in early/prefibrotic myelofibrosis diagnosed according to the World Health Organization criteria. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was calculated on a total number of 264 patients derived from an international database. After a median follow-up of 6.28 years, 42 (15.9%) patients experienced arterial (n = 31) or venous thrombosis (n = 11). A higher leukocyte count correlated with an increased risk for total thrombosis and in particular, with an increased risk for arterial thrombosis (P = 0.005, HR 1.15 and P = 0.047, HR 1.12, respectively). A platelet count above 870 × 10⁹/L was associated with a lower risk for total thrombosis and also for venous thrombosis (P = 0.022, HR 0.44 and P = 0.027, HR 0.19). Moreover, a lower hemoglobin level was associated with an increased risk for venous thrombosis (P = 0.007, HR 0.59). Our data indicate that leukocytosis is a prominent risk factor for thrombosis in early/prefibrotic MF.",

Due to the morbidity and mortality of these events, antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant agents are commonly employed as primary and/or secondary prophylaxis. On the other hand, disease-related bleeding complications (i.e., from esophageal varices) are common in patients with MPN.

      "# Title: Thromboses and hemorrhages are common in MPN patients with high JAK2V617F allele burden.\n# Abstract: The most common causes of morbidity and mortality in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications. The JAK2V617F mutation, commonly found in MPN, correlates with several clinical and laboratory characteristics even if the relevance of JAK2V617F allele burden in the natural history of these diseases is unclear. In this study we searched, a relation between thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications and JAK2V617F allele burden level in MPN patients. We evaluated 253 consecutive MPN [121 essential thrombocythemia (ET), 124 polycythemia vera (PV), and 8 primary myelofibrosis (PMF)] patients in whom the JAK2V617F allele burden was available, all studied and followed (median 8.8 years) in our department. Patients were stratified accordingly to their JAK2V617F allele burden, into four quartiles (1st <25%, 2nd 26-50%, 3rd 51-75%, and 4th >75%). Significantly higher incidence of thromboses (p = 0.001) and hemorrhages (p < 0.001) during follow-up has been observed in higher quartiles when compared to lower ones. Thrombosis- and hemorrhage-free survivals were poorer in patients belonging to the highest quartile. Our data suggest that MPN patients with JAK2V617F allele burden higher than 75% have to be considered as high risk patients, being prone to develop thrombo-hemorrhagic complications during the disease course.",
      "# Title: Risk factors for arterial versus venous thrombosis in polycythemia vera: a single center experience in 587 patients.\n# Abstract: In a recent International Working Group on Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) study, prior arterial events and hypertension were predictors of subsequent arterial thrombosis whereas prior venous events and age ≥65 years predicted venous thrombosis in polycythemia vera (PV). In the current study, we sought to validate the above findings and identify additional predictors of arterial versus venous thrombosis. At a median follow up of 109 months, thrombosis after diagnosis occurred in 128 (22%) patients; 82 (14%) arterial and 57 (10%) venous events. On multivariate analysis, prior arterial events (<0.0001), hyperlipidemia (p = 0.03), and hypertension (p = 0.02) predicted subsequent arterial events. In comparison, prior venous events (p = 0.05), leukocytosis ≥11 × 109/L (p = 0.002), and major hemorrhage (p = 0.02) were predictors of subsequent venous events. Salient associations with arterial thrombosis included age ≥ 60 years, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and normal karyotype whereas age ≤ 60 years, females, palpable splenomegaly and history of major hemorrhage were associated with venous thrombosis. TET2 or ASXL1 mutations did not impact arterial nor venous thrombosis. In conclusion, we identify distinct associations for arterial versus venous thrombosis in PV and confirm that a prior arterial or venous thrombotic event is the most reliable predictor of subsequent events.",
      "# Title: Evaluation of vascular events in patients with myeloproliferative syndromes and mutations of either the januskinase-2 or calreticulin gene at the university hospital Krems from 2008 to 2015.\n# Abstract: Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), classified as polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis (ET) and myelofibrosis (MF) are stem-cell derived disorders. Mutations in either the januskinase-2 (JAK-2) or the calreticulin (CALR) gene are characteristic for MPN and may result in enhanced proliferation of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets, and thus increase the risk for vascular events. This study is a retrospective and descriptive analysis of records of patients, who underwent treatment for myeloproliferative syndromes at the Department of Hemato-Oncology of the University hospital Krems from 2008 to the end of 2015. Out of 250 patients, who were suspected for MPN, 51 patients displayed a JAK-2 V617F mutation. These were analyzed with regard to their blood values, gender, age at diagnosis, therapy and vascular events before and after diagnosis (during therapy). Of the 51 patients diagnosed with MPN and a JAK-2 V617F mutation, 33 suffered from PV, 15 from ET and 3 from MF. More men than women were diagnosed with MPN and the median age at diagnosis was 72 years. Acetylsalicylic acid, phlebotomy and Hydroxyurea were the most frequent therapies applied. In our study cohort, the most common vascular events were acute coronary syndrome and transitory ischemic attack. Thromboembolic events were effectively reduced by MPN therapy while no elevation in bleeding events could be observed.",
      "# Title: Clinico-hematological profile and thrombotic/hemorrhagic events in 150 chinese patients with essential thrombocythemia.\n# Abstract: Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is an uncommon chronic myeloproliferative disorder with no cure. Patients with ET are at risk of different complications, and currently there are no optimal prognostic standards to predict severe post-diagnosis complications such as thrombosis and hemorrhage. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the full set of clinical data from 150 Chinese patients with ET enrolled from 2013 to 2016. We discovered that neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), along with other known clinical parameters such as age, leukocyte count, incidence of thrombotic events is higher in patients with JAK2 V617F mutation. NLR is also higher in patients at high-risk stratification of thrombosis. Multivariate analysis showed that age (P = 0.001, 95% CI 1.023-1.089) and JAK2 V617F mutation (P = 0.003, 95% CI 1.837-21.035) were independent factors for thrombotic events, while age (P = 0.005, 95% CI 1.019-1.111) was the only predictive factor for hemorrhagic events at diagnosis. For future thrombotic events, multivariate analysis revealed NLR as the best predictive parameter (P < 0.001, 95% CI 1.173-1.486) when compared with other clinical parameters such as age (P = 0.037, 95% CI 1.004-1.126), thrombosis at diagnosis (P = 0.036, 95% CI 1.077-9.099) and WBC count (P = 0.047, 95% CI 1.001-1.109). Further ROC curve and Kaplan Meier analysis validated NLR as better prognostic marker for future thrombotic events and thrombosis-free survival. In summary, our data suggest that NLR parameter may possess great prognostic significance for future thrombosis in ET patients."

      "conclusionA": "Across all myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) – Polycythemia Vera (PV), Essential Thrombocythemia (ET), and Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF) – age, *JAK2* mutation status, platelet count, and white blood cell count at diagnosis significantly modify the risk of thrombotic and bleeding events, with age consistently emerging as a key independent predictor; however, the specific impact of these factors varies considerably by MPN subtype, necessitating individualized risk assessment and treatment strategies beyond simply classifying by disease type.",
      "conclusionB": "Patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) exhibit an increased risk of both thrombosis and hemorrhage, with the incidence of thrombotic events ranging from approximately 7.2% to 22% per patient-year, and bleeding events occurring in 6-12% of patients; critically, higher JAK2V617F allele burden ( >75%) and leukocytosis are independently associated with increased risk of these vascular complications, particularly arterial thrombosis, while prior thrombotic events are the strongest predictor of future events."

      "# Title: Future development of nursing home quality indicators.\n# Abstract: Nursing home quality indicators have been developed over the past 10 years to quantify nursing home quality and to draw systematic comparisons between facilities. Although these indicators have been applied widely for nursing home regulation, quality improvement, and public reporting, researchers and stakeholders have raised concerns about their accuracy and usefulness. We critically evaluate nursing home quality indicators from the standpoint of theory, measurement, and application, and we recommend strategies to make the indicators more valuable as quality assessment tools. We recommend that (a) more comprehensive quality indicators should be developed in conjunction with the new Minimum Data Set 3.0; (b) the validity and reliability of the indicators should be evaluated thoroughly with respect to both measurement and application; (c) statistical criteria should be incorporated explicitly into quality indicator scoring and outlier targeting; (d) the dimensionality and theoretical structure of the quality indicators should be carefully examined; (e) risk adjustment methods should be refined and broadened; and (f) quality indicator reporting systems should be strengthened and tailored to stakeholders' needs.",

      "# Title: Nutritional care; do process and structure indicators influence malnutrition prevalence over time?\n# Abstract: To date, no information is available about the effect of structural and process factors of nutritional care on the prevalence of malnutrition over time in the long-term care sector. This study analyzes the trend of malnutrition prevalence rates between 2007 and 2011 in the long-term care sector, and the related effects of(1) process indicators such as nutritional screening and treatment and 2) structural indicators (guideline, protocol or nutritional screening policy). From 2007 to 2011, the Dutch National Prevalence Measurement of Care Problems (LPZ) was performed in Dutch long-term care organizations using a standardized questionnaire involving measurements at institutional, ward and resident level. The data were analyzed by mixed-linear regression for longitudinal data. Presence of malnutrition was assessed by BMI, undesired weight loss and nutritional intake. Seventy-four care homes were included (26,101 residents). The malnutrition prevalence trend significantly decreased (P < 0.001) from 26% to 18% from 2007 to 2011. In the final model of the mixed effects analysis only the interacted process indicators nutritional screening and oral nutritional supplementation (ONS) were significant in influencing malnutrition prevalence rates over time. Structural indicators had no impact on the malnutrition prevalence over time. In conclusion, over time a lower prevalence of malnutrition is associated with a higher degree of nutritional screening. As might be expected, a higher prevalence of malnutrition is associated with higher use of ONS. Structural nutritional screening is an important intervention to tackle the problem of malnutrition in the long term care sector.",

      "# Title: Which characteristics of nursing home residents influence differences in malnutrition prevalence? An international comparison of The Netherlands, Germany and Austria.\n# Abstract: Prevalence rates of malnutrition vary considerably internationally, partly due to differences in measurement methodology and instruments. In the present study, the same measurement methodology and instruments were used in The Netherlands, Germany and Austria. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether resident characteristics influence possible differences in malnutrition prevalence between countries. The study followed a cross-sectional, multi-centre design that measured malnutrition in nursing home residents from The Netherlands, Germany and Austria. Resident data were gathered using a standardised questionnaire. Malnutrition was operationalised using BMI, unintentional weight loss and nutritional intake. Data were analysed using an association model. The prevalence rates of malnutrition in The Netherlands, Germany and Austria were 18·3, 20·1 and 22·5 %, respectively. The multivariate generalised estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression analysis showed that sex, age, care dependency, the mean number of diseases and some specific diseases were influencing factors for whether the resident was malnourished or not. The OR of malnutrition in the three countries declined after including the influencing factors resulting from the multivariate GEE analysis. The present study reveals that differences in the prevalence rates of malnutrition in nursing homes in The Netherlands, Germany and Austria are influenced by different resident characteristics. Since other country-related factors could also play an important role in influencing differences in the prevalence rates of malnutrition between the countries (structural and process factors of malnutrition care policy). We recommend the investigation of these factors in future studies.",

A retrospective study of 103 patients.\n# Abstract: A retrospective study of 103 patients with essential thrombocythemia was carried out to evaluate the incidence of thrombohemorrhagic complications and establish whether there were any correlations between these events and clinical or laboratory data. At onset or during the course of the disease, 26 patients (25.2%) presented thrombotic and 12 (11.6%) hemorrhagic complications: among the latter, six patients had gastrointestinal bleeding during antiaggregant therapy. No significant correlations were observed between thrombohemorrhagic complications and platelet count, age, sex, platelet function, bleeding time, or therapeutic regimen. However, there was a statistically significant correlation between a positive patient history for thrombotic events and an increase in thromboses. In agreement with other authors, it is believed that the best approach in asymptomatic patients is strict surveillance without treatment. Chemotherapy and/or treatment with antiaggregant agents should be reserved for symptomatic patients or patients with a positive history for thrombotic events.",
      "# Title: Clinical course of essential thrombocythemia in 147 cases.\n# Abstract: The authors retrospectively analyzed the initial characteristics, treatment, and clinical course in 147 patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET). Median age was 60 years and the M:F ratio was 0.69. At diagnosis, 53 patients were asymptomatic; 50 patients had functional symptoms (mainly vasomotor disturbances); 27 patients had large vessel thrombosis; 27 patients had a bleeding diathesis; and seven patients had both bleeding and thrombosis. The platelet count ranged from 0.7 to 2.92 X 10(12)/l. Forty-five of the 61 tested patients (61%) had prolonged bleeding time and/or platelet hypoaggregation. Three patients had in vitro spontaneous aggregation. No significant correlations were found between hemostatic findings and in vivo bleeding or thrombosis. The incidence of bleeding, however, was higher in patients with more than 2 x 10(12)/l platelets. Of 87 karyotypes performed with banding techniques, only four were abnormal. One hundred twenty-nine patients received one or more cytoreductive agents at diagnosis or during follow-up. Sixty patients received an antiaggregating agent. First-line therapy was radiophosphorus (32P) in 22 patients; busulfan in 35 patients; and hydroxyurea in 72 patients. Hydroxyurea required continuous maintenance therapy and had to be changed to another treatment in 12 of the initial responders because of inadequate control of thrombocythemia. During follow-up, 14 treated patients experienced one or several major thrombotic events. Two untreated patients also had major thrombosis. Only one major bleeding event was seen during follow-up. Median actuarial survival was 73.5% at 7 years and only one patient progressed to acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). These results suggest that large vessel thrombosis is the main complication of ET. It appears largely unpredictable in a given patient at diagnosis but can be largely prevented by the control of thrombocythemia. Because of the low incidence of side effects of treatment in this experience, the authors believe that cytoreductive therapy is indicated in most patients with ET, as long as a group of patients with very low risk of thrombosis is not defined in prospective studies.",
      "# Title: Major vascular complications in essential thrombocythemia: a study of the predictive factors in a series of 148 patients.\n# Abstract: To determine the clinicohematological factors predictive for the appearance of major vascular complications (MVC) in patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET), 148 consecutive such patients were retrospectively assessed for the development of MVC during a median follow-up of 58.5 months. Seventy-seven patients had vascular risk factors, and 37 a history of MVC at ET diagnosis. Forty-nine MVC were registered in 33 patients during the follow-up period. The actuarial probability of MVC was 27% at 6 years in the whole series, 35.6% for patients above 60 years, and 21.4% for patients younger than 60 years, whereas only one of the 36 patients younger than 45 years had MVC. At multivariate analysis, age >60 years, history of major ischemia and hypercholesterolemia were the variables associated with an increased MVC risk. These results suggest that all ET patients above 60 years should be treated, whereas in younger patients treatment decisions should be primarily based on the existence of risk factors for MVC.",
      "# Title: Thrombosis and bleeding in myeloproliferative disorders: identification of at-risk patients with whole blood platelet aggregation studies.\n# Abstract: Seventy-five patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders were studied to investigate platelet function by simultaneous measurement of platelet aggregation by the impedance method and ATP dense granule release using a whole blood platelet lumi-aggregometer, in an attempt to identify patients at risk for thrombosis and bleeding. Thirty-nine patients had at least one abnormal result indicating platelet hyperactivity (i.e. impedance or release with one agonist being above the reference range); 16 patients had platelet hypoactivity (i.e. at least one result was below the reference range), whilst 14 had co-existence of hyper- and hypoactivity. Six patients had normal results. 20/53 patients with platelet hyperactivity (alone or mixed) had a positive history of venous and/or arterial thrombosis; in comparison, only two of the other 22 patients had a positive history. During a median follow-up of 33 months, nine patients with and one patient without platelet hyperactivity respectively developed new thrombotic events before the addition of specific therapy. A total of 50 patients with and eight patients without platelet hyperactivity respectively received specific treatment including aspirin and/or cytotoxic therapy. All but one elderly patient with platelet hyperactivity have remained free of new thrombotic events on specific therapy. Two of the 17 patients with platelet hypoactivity had major clinical bleeding. These observations highlight the need to test platelets for hyper- as well as hypo-function and suggest a useful role for routine whole blood platelet aggregation studies to identify the patients at risk for thrombosis or bleeding.",
      "# Title: Incidence, clinical features and outcome of essential thrombocythaemia in a well defined geographical area.\n# Abstract: In an attempt to characterise the clinical features, incidence and outcome of essential thrombocythaemia (ET) we report our experience in a large unselected series of patients from a well defined region. All new cases of ET in the County of Copenhagen were registered during the period 1977-98. We identified 96 cases of ET, yielding an age- and sex-adjusted annual incidence rate of 0.59/100.000 and a point-prevalence at last follow up of 11/100.000. The overall incidence rate was 0.31 and 1.00 per 100.000 population during the consecutive periods 1977-89 and 1990-98, respectively, corresponding to a 3.2-fold increase. Median age at diagnosis was 67 yr (females 68 yr, males 66 yr, range 18-87 yr), and the female to male (F/M) ratio was 2.6:1. At diagnosis, 52% of the patients displayed no ET-related symptoms and were discovered fortuitously by a routine platelet count. Forty-eight percent presented with thrombohaemorrhagic phenomena, of which microvascular disturbances of the central nervous system (CNS), extremities and skin were most frequently observed (23%). Compared to patients diagnosed after 1989, patients diagnosed before 1990 had a significantly higher mean platelet count, white blood cell (WBC) count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) value and alkaline phosphatase value. With a median follow up of 70 months, 5-yr survival was 76%, significantly lower than the expected survival of an age- and sex-matched control group (p = 0.0052). Thirty-seven patients experienced a total of 55 thrombohaemorrhagic events during follow-up, corresponding to an incidence of thrombosis and microvascular disturbances or haemorrhage of 8.1% per pt-yr and 2.5% per pt-yr, respectively. The number of patients experiencing thrombosis or microvascular disturbances was significantly higher among the 29 patients who never received acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) compared to the 67 patients who received ASA during follow up (45% vs. 21%; p = 0.017). This study provides population-based data suggesting the benefit of treatment with low-dose ASA in a non-selected population of patients with ET.",

      "# Title: Frequency and risk factors for thrombosis in idiopathic myelofibrosis: analysis in a series of 155 patients from a single institution.\n# Abstract: Thrombosis is a frequent complication of polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia, but its incidence and predisposing factors in idiopathic myelofibrosis (IM) are unknown. In 18 (11.6%) of 155 patients diagnosed with IM in a single institution, 31 thrombotic events (19 arterial, 12 venous) were registered after a mean follow-up of 4.2 (s.d.: 4.5) years. In six patients, the thrombosis was simultaneous to or appeared a few months before IM diagnosis and 14 had one or more thrombotic episodes. When compared with the general population, a significant increase was observed in the incidence of venous thrombosis (odds ratio 17.5, 95% confidence interval: 10.3-31.4). At multivariate analysis, the initial variables associated with an increased risk of thrombosis were thrombocytosis (platelets >450 x 10(9)/l, P=0.001), presence of one cardiovascular risk factor (arterial hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes, P=0.003), cellular phase of myelofibrosis (P=0.005), and Hb >11 g/dl (P=0.02). Considering post-diagnosis events, the 5-year thrombosis-free survival probability was 90.4% in the series, 80.6% for patients with platelets >450 x 10(9)/l, 82.6% for patients with one cardiovascular risk factor, and 85.1% for those in cellular phase. These results indicate an increased thrombotic risk for IM patients with hyperproliferative features and/or coexistent cardiovascular risk factors.",

      "# Title: Leukocytosis is a risk factor for thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia: interaction with treatment, standard risk factors, and Jak2 mutation status.\n# Abstract: Leukocytes contribute to the pathogenesis of thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia (ET) through recently discovered mechanisms of activation and interaction with platelets and endothelial cells. To evaluate whether an increased leukocyte count was associated with thrombosis and whether this effect can be modulated by therapy, we analyzed the clinical course of 439 patients with ET followed at the Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo. The strength of the association was measured at diagnosis or before thrombotic events by multivariable analyses carried out using data at baseline as well as time-varying covariates. The results showed that (1) an increased leukocyte count at diagnosis was associated with thrombosis during follow-up (\"baseline analysis,\" relative risk [RR] 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-3.9, P = .001); (2) hydroxyurea (HU) lowered leukocytosis and reduced the strength of the association between leukocytosis and thrombosis (\"time-dependent analysis,\" RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.9-2.0, not significant [NS]); (3) the association of leukocytosis and thrombosis was more evident in untreated low-risk patients (RR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-6.4, P = .01) compared with HU-treated high-risk patients (RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.8-3.2, NS); and (4) the presence of JAK2 V617F was not identified as a risk factor for thrombosis during follow-up despite a significant association between the mutation and leukocytosis. We suggest validation of these findings in prospective clinical studies.",
      "# Title: Clinical profile of homozygous JAK2 617V>F mutation in patients with polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia.\n# Abstract: JAK2 617V>F mutation occurs in a homozygous state in 25% to 30% of patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and 2% to 4% with essential thrombocythemia (ET). Whether homozygosity associates with distinct clinical phenotypes is still under debate. This retrospective multicenter study considered 118 JAK2 617V>F homozygous patients (104 PV, 14 ET) whose clinical characteristics were compared with those of 587 heterozygous and 257 wild-type patients. Irrespective of their clinical diagnosis, homozygous patients were older, displayed a higher leukocyte count and hematocrit value at diagnosis, and presented larger spleen volume. Aquagenic pruritus was significantly more common among homozygous PV patients. JAK2 617V>F homozygosity associated with more frequent evolution into secondary myelofibrosis in both PV and ET. After adjustment for sex, age, leukocyte count, and previous thrombosis in a multivariate analysis, homozygous ET patients displayed a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio [HR] 3.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-11.7; P = .013) than wild-type (HR = 1.0) or heterozygous patients (HR = 1.49). No significant association of JAK2 617V>F homozygosity with thrombosis risk was observed in PV. Finally, JAK2 617V>F homozygous patients were more likely to receive chemotherapy for control of disease. We conclude that JAK2 617V>F homozygosity identifies PV or ET patients with a more symptomatic myeloproliferative disorder and is associated with a higher risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with ET.",
      "# Title: Vascular events in Korean patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and their relationship to JAK2 mutation.\n# Abstract: Evaluation of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F mutation has been widely used for the diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). However, its prognostic relevance to clinical outcome is not completely understood. We investigated the association of JAK2 V617F with vascular events in Korean patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). We studied 283 patients from 15 centers, who were diagnosed with MPN. The JAK2 V617F status was evaluated by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. The patients' diagnoses were essential thrombocythemia (ET n = 146), polycythemia vera (PV n = 120), primary myelofibrosis (n = 12), and unclassifiable MPN (MPNu n = 5). JAK2 V617F was detected in 89 (61%) patients with ET, 103 (86%) with PV, four (33%) with myelofibrosis, and four (80%) with MPNu. A higher number of leukocytes, haemoglobin levels and BM cellularity as well as an older age, lower platelet counts, and diagnosis of PV were significantly correlated with JAK2 V617F. Eighty-three and 43 episodes of thrombosis and bleeding occurred in 100 patients each before and after the diagnosis. Vascular events more frequently occurred in 37% of patients with JAK2 V617F than in 29% of those without the mutation (p = 0.045). Among 175 patients whose samples were available for sequencing, 28 patients with homozygous JAK2 V617F had vascular events more frequently (57%) than those who were heterozygotes (39%) or had the wild type (27%) (p = 0.03). The multivariate analysis showed that a JAK2 homozygous mutation, hypercholesterolemia and older age were independent risk factors for a vascular event. The results of this study showed that Korean patients with MPN had a similar JAK2 mutation rate and frequency of vascular events when compared to Western patients. The presence of V617F was significantly related to vascular events. Therefore, initial evaluation for the JAK2 mutation and careful monitoring for vascular events should be performed in MPN patients.",
      "# Title: Thrombosis in primary myelofibrosis: incidence and risk factors.\n# Abstract: We assessed frequency and predictive factors for major cardiovascular (CV) events in 707 patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) followed in 4 European institutions. A total of 236 deaths (33%) were recorded for an overall mortality of 7.7% patient-years (pt-yr). Fatal and nonfatal thromboses were registered in 51 (7.2%) patients, with a rate of 1.75% pt-yr. If deaths from non-CV causes were considered as competing events, we estimated that the adjusted rate of major thrombotic events would have been 2.2% pt-yr. In a multivariable model, age older than 60 years (hazard ratio [HR], 2.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-4.39, P = .01) and JAK2 mutational status (HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.10-3.34; P = .02) were significantly associated with thrombosis, whereas the strength of the association between leukocyte count higher than 15 x 10(9)/L and CV events was of borderline significance (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 0.97-2.72; P = .06). The highest incidence of fatal and nonfatal thrombosis was observed when the mutation was present along with leukocytosis (3.9% pt-yr; HR, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.26-7.81). This study is the largest hitherto carried out in this setting and shows that the rate of major CV events in PMF is comparable with that reported in essential thrombocythemia, and it is increased in aged patients and those with JAK2 V617F mutation and leukocytosis.",
      "# Title: Thrombosis in myelofibrosis: prior thrombosis is the only predictive factor and most venous events are provoked.\n# Abstract: In a retrospective analysis of 205 patients (median age 62 years) with primary myelofibrosis and known JAK2V617F mutational status, 13.2% experienced a vaso-occlusive event at or prior to their diagnosis. After a median follow up of 31 months, post-diagnosis thrombosis occurred in 22 patients (10.7%), including 9 (4.4%) and 16 (7.8%) patients with a total of 9 arterial and 24 venous events, respectively. The majority (71%) of the venous events were temporally associated with other exogenous risk factors for thrombosis such as surgery, line placement or hormonal therapy. On multivariable analysis that included age, JAK2V617F mutation status and leukocyte count as covariates, history of thrombosis was the only predictive variable in general (P=0.04) or when arterial (P=0.007) and venous (P=0.02) thromboses were analyzed separately. The current study demonstrates a higher prevalence of venous, as opposed to arterial, events in PMF, post-diagnosis, and clarifies their nature as being mostly provoked.",
      "# Title: Impact of leukocytosis on thrombotic risk and survival in 532 patients with essential thrombocythemia: a retrospective study.\n# Abstract: Established risk factors for thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia (ET) include age (≥ 60 years) and previous vascular events. Recently, also leukocytosis has been proposed in risk stratification of ET patients. We report a retrospective study on 532 ET patients followed for a median of 7.6 years. Sixty-four patients (12%) developed 95 thrombotic events during follow-up. Together with the high-risk condition, a white blood cell (WBC) value above 11 × 10⁹/L, corresponding to the fourth percentile value, significantly correlated with a higher thrombotic risk (p = 0.033) by Cox proportional hazards. Moreover, the cumulative risk of thrombosis was significantly higher in high-risk patients with WBC >11 × 10⁹/L. JAK2 V617F mutation did not correlate with thrombosis. Overall, 123 (23%) patients died. Three independent parameters were noted as prognostic factors for survival in multivariate analysis: age > 60 years, leukocytosis >11 × 10⁹/L, and hemoglobin level below normal values. Based on these parameters, three groups of risk were defined, with significantly different survivals. Baseline leukocytosis correlated with a higher thrombotic risk in high-risk patients and identified a cohort of patients with worse survival.",
      "# Title: Incidence and risk factors for bleeding in 1104 patients with essential thrombocythemia or prefibrotic myelofibrosis diagnosed according to the 2008 WHO criteria.\n# Abstract: In an international study of 1104 patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET), a histological review according to the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria confirmed ET in 891 patients (WHO-ET, 81%), and revised the diagnosis to prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis (PMF) in 180 patients (PMF, 16%). Major bleeding during follow-up occurred in 55 (6%) WHO-ET and 21 (12%) PMF patients (P = 0.009), at a rate of 0.79 and 1.39% patients per year, respectively, (P = 0.039). In a multivariable analysis, predictors of bleeding included diagnosis of PMF (P = 0.05; hazard ratio (HR) 1.74), leukocytosis (P = 0.04; HR 1.74), previous hemorrhage (P = 0.025; HR 2.35) and aspirin therapy (P=0.001; HR 3.16). The analysis restricted to patients with WHO-ET confirmed previous hemorrhage (P = 0.043; HR 1.92) and aspirin (P=0.027; HR 2.24) as independent risk factors. The current study reveals that major bleeding associated with thrombocytosis might be relatively specific to PMF, as opposed to WHO-defined ET. Furthermore, it shows that low-dose aspirin exacerbates these hemorrhagic events of PMF. In contrast, thrombocytosis per se was not a risk factor for bleeding; however, low-dose aspirin had a synergistic hemorrhagic effect unmasking the bleeding tendency of patients with extreme thrombocytosis. These observations carry significant therapeutic implications in these two WHO entities.",
      "# Title: Leukocytosis as an important risk factor for arterial thrombosis in WHO-defined early/prefibrotic myelofibrosis: an international study of 264 patients.\n# Abstract: We aimed to determine risk factors for thrombotic events in early/prefibrotic myelofibrosis diagnosed according to the World Health Organization criteria. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was calculated on a total number of 264 patients derived from an international database. After a median follow-up of 6.28 years, 42 (15.9%) patients experienced arterial (n = 31) or venous thrombosis (n = 11). A higher leukocyte count correlated with an increased risk for total thrombosis and in particular, with an increased risk for arterial thrombosis (P = 0.005, HR 1.15 and P = 0.047, HR 1.12, respectively). A platelet count above 870 × 10⁹/L was associated with a lower risk for total thrombosis and also for venous thrombosis (P = 0.022, HR 0.44 and P = 0.027, HR 0.19). Moreover, a lower hemoglobin level was associated with an increased risk for venous thrombosis (P = 0.007, HR 0.59). Our data indicate that leukocytosis is a prominent risk factor for thrombosis in early/prefibrotic MF.",

      "# Title: Thromboses and hemorrhages are common in MPN patients with high JAK2V617F allele burden.\n# Abstract: The most common causes of morbidity and mortality in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications. The JAK2V617F mutation, commonly found in MPN, correlates with several clinical and laboratory characteristics even if the relevance of JAK2V617F allele burden in the natural history of these diseases is unclear. In this study we searched, a relation between thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications and JAK2V617F allele burden level in MPN patients. We evaluated 253 consecutive MPN [121 essential thrombocythemia (ET), 124 polycythemia vera (PV), and 8 primary myelofibrosis (PMF)] patients in whom the JAK2V617F allele burden was available, all studied and followed (median 8.8 years) in our department. Patients were stratified accordingly to their JAK2V617F allele burden, into four quartiles (1st <25%, 2nd 26-50%, 3rd 51-75%, and 4th >75%). Significantly higher incidence of thromboses (p = 0.001) and hemorrhages (p < 0.001) during follow-up has been observed in higher quartiles when compared to lower ones. Thrombosis- and hemorrhage-free survivals were poorer in patients belonging to the highest quartile. Our data suggest that MPN patients with JAK2V617F allele burden higher than 75% have to be considered as high risk patients, being prone to develop thrombo-hemorrhagic complications during the disease course.",
      "# Title: Risk factors for arterial versus venous thrombosis in polycythemia vera: a single center experience in 587 patients.\n# Abstract: In a recent International Working Group on Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) study, prior arterial events and hypertension were predictors of subsequent arterial thrombosis whereas prior venous events and age ≥65 years predicted venous thrombosis in polycythemia vera (PV). In the current study, we sought to validate the above findings and identify additional predictors of arterial versus venous thrombosis. At a median follow up of 109 months, thrombosis after diagnosis occurred in 128 (22%) patients; 82 (14%) arterial and 57 (10%) venous events. On multivariate analysis, prior arterial events (<0.0001), hyperlipidemia (p = 0.03), and hypertension (p = 0.02) predicted subsequent arterial events. In comparison, prior venous events (p = 0.05), leukocytosis ≥11 × 109/L (p = 0.002), and major hemorrhage (p = 0.02) were predictors of subsequent venous events. Salient associations with arterial thrombosis included age ≥ 60 years, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and normal karyotype whereas age ≤ 60 years, females, palpable splenomegaly and history of major hemorrhage were associated with venous thrombosis. TET2 or ASXL1 mutations did not impact arterial nor venous thrombosis. In conclusion, we identify distinct associations for arterial versus venous thrombosis in PV and confirm that a prior arterial or venous thrombotic event is the most reliable predictor of subsequent events.",
      "# Title: Evaluation of vascular events in patients with myeloproliferative syndromes and mutations of either the januskinase-2 or calreticulin gene at the university hospital Krems from 2008 to 2015.\n# Abstract: Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), classified as polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis (ET) and myelofibrosis (MF) are stem-cell derived disorders. Mutations in either the januskinase-2 (JAK-2) or the calreticulin (CALR) gene are characteristic for MPN and may result in enhanced proliferation of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets, and thus increase the risk for vascular events. This study is a retrospective and descriptive analysis of records of patients, who underwent treatment for myeloproliferative syndromes at the Department of Hemato-Oncology of the University hospital Krems from 2008 to the end of 2015. Out of 250 patients, who were suspected for MPN, 51 patients displayed a JAK-2 V617F mutation. These were analyzed with regard to their blood values, gender, age at diagnosis, therapy and vascular events before and after diagnosis (during therapy). Of the 51 patients diagnosed with MPN and a JAK-2 V617F mutation, 33 suffered from PV, 15 from ET and 3 from MF. More men than women were diagnosed with MPN and the median age at diagnosis was 72 years. Acetylsalicylic acid, phlebotomy and Hydroxyurea were the most frequent therapies applied. In our study cohort, the most common vascular events were acute coronary syndrome and transitory ischemic attack. Thromboembolic events were effectively reduced by MPN therapy while no elevation in bleeding events could be observed.",
      "# Title: Clinico-hematological profile and thrombotic/hemorrhagic events in 150 chinese patients with essential thrombocythemia.\n# Abstract: Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is an uncommon chronic myeloproliferative disorder with no cure. Patients with ET are at risk of different complications, and currently there are no optimal prognostic standards to predict severe post-diagnosis complications such as thrombosis and hemorrhage. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the full set of clinical data from 150 Chinese patients with ET enrolled from 2013 to 2016. We discovered that neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), along with other known clinical parameters such as age, leukocyte count, incidence of thrombotic events is higher in patients with JAK2 V617F mutation. NLR is also higher in patients at high-risk stratification of thrombosis. Multivariate analysis showed that age (P = 0.001, 95% CI 1.023-1.089) and JAK2 V617F mutation (P = 0.003, 95% CI 1.837-21.035) were independent factors for thrombotic events, while age (P = 0.005, 95% CI 1.019-1.111) was the only predictive factor for hemorrhagic events at diagnosis. For future thrombotic events, multivariate analysis revealed NLR as the best predictive parameter (P < 0.001, 95% CI 1.173-1.486) when compared with other clinical parameters such as age (P = 0.037, 95% CI 1.004-1.126), thrombosis at diagnosis (P = 0.036, 95% CI 1.077-9.099) and WBC count (P = 0.047, 95% CI 1.001-1.109). Further ROC curve and Kaplan Meier analysis validated NLR as better prognostic marker for future thrombotic events and thrombosis-free survival. In summary, our data suggest that NLR parameter may possess great prognostic significance for future thrombosis in ET patients."

      "conclusionB": "**Primary Concluding Statement:**\n\nAmong patients with Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), including essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), there is a significantly increased risk of both thrombosis and hemorrhage. Key risk factors identified across multiple studies include older age (particularly >60 years), history of prior vascular events (thrombotic or hemorrhagic), leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count), JAK2 V617F mutation status (especially homozygosity in ET), and specific disease characteristics like cellular phase in myelofibrosis or high platelet counts in ET. Low-dose aspirin is associated with a reduced risk of thrombosis in ET, though it may increase bleeding risk, particularly in PMF. Interventions like cytoreductive therapy and antiplatelet agents are used to mitigate these risks, and specific risk stratification models (e.g., IPSET, IPSET-Thrombosis) have been developed to guide management."

We examined WFA+ -M2BP levels in patients with F4 (cirrhosis), F3 or more (advanced fibrosis) and F2 or more (significant fibrosis) in the two groups. We further examined the relationship between five fibrosis markers and the degree of fibrosis. The WFA+ -M2BP values ranged from 0.25 cut-off index (COI) to 12.9 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 0.34-20.0 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P<.0001). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F4 in the two groups were 2.83 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 5.03 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P=.0046). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F3 or more in the two groups were 1.79 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 3.79 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P<.0001). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F2 or more in the two groups were 1.49 COI in the hepatitis B cohort and 3.19 COI in the hepatitis C group (P<.0001). Among five liver fibrosis markers, WFA+ -M2BP had the highest correlation coefficient (rs =.629) in terms of correlation with the degree of fibrosis in the patients with hepatitis C and had the second highest rs value (.415) in the hepatitis B group. Although WFA+ -M2BP could be a useful indicator of liver fibrosis, WFA+ -M2BP levels in the two groups significantly differed even in the same degree of fibrosis.

      "# Title: Serum Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n# Abstract: Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein (WFA+-M2BP) has been suggested to be useful for the assessment of disease severity in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Consecutive adult NAFLD patients who had a liver biopsy were included. Serum WFA+-M2BP level was measured using a lectin-antibody sandwich immunoassay using a chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay machine (HISCL-5000, Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). The measured levels were indexed using the following equation: Cut-off index (COI) = ([WFA+-M2BP]sample-[WFA+-M2BP]NC) / ([WFA+-M2BP]PC-[WFA+-M2BP]NC), where PC = positive control and NC = negative control. Histopathological examination of liver biopsy specimen was reported according to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Clinical Research Network Scoring System. Data for 220 cases were analyzed. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of NASH was 0.65. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of steatosis grade ≥2 and 3 was 0.64 and 0.53, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of lobular inflammation grade ≥1, ≥2 and 3 was 0.57, 0.68 and 0.59, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of hepatocyte ballooning grade ≥1 and 2 was 0.64 and 0.65, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of fibrosis stage ≥1, ≥2, ≥3 and 4 was 0.61, 0.71, 0.74 and 0.84, respectively. Out of the 220 cases, 152 cases were the same 76 patients who had a repeat liver biopsy after 48 weeks of intervention. The AUROC of the change in the COI to detect improvement in steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning and fibrosis was 0.57, 0.54, 0.59 and 0.52, respectively. In conclusion, serum WFA+-M2BP was most useful for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in NAFLD patients. However, it was less useful for differentiating NASH from non-NASH, and for diagnosis and follow-up of the individual histopathological components of NASH.",

We assessed its efficacy in evaluating liver disease severity in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in Taiwan. The association between WFA+-M2BP and histological features was evaluated among those CHC patients underwent liver biopsy. We also aimed to clarify the factors determining the performance of WFA+-M2BP in CHC. A total of 229 CHC patients were consecutively recruited. The mean value of WFA+-M2BP in patients from F0 to F4 was 1.68, 2.23, 3.45, 3.48, 3.77 respectively (linear trend P = 0.008). Linear regression analysis revealed that alanine aminotransferase (odds ratio [OR]: 0.03, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.02-0.05, P < 0.001), AST (OR: -0.1, 95% CI: -0.02 to -0.01, P < 0.001), and liver fibrosis (OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.01-0.59, P = 0.043) were the independent factors correlated to serum WFA+-M2BP level. The optimal cutoff values of WFA+-M2BP for fibrosis stages F1, F2, F3, and F4 were 1.42, 1.61, 1.42, and 2.67, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the platelet count (OR/CI: -0.009/0.986-0.996, P = <0.001), r-glutamyl transferase (OR/CI: 0.007/1.000-1.013, P = 0.036), and WFA+-M2BP (OR/CI: 0.187/1.057-1.374, P = 0.005).

      "# Title: Comparison of serum fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B.\n# Abstract: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The diagnosis of liver fibrosis has a key role in selecting patients with CHB for antiviral treatment. However, serum biomarkers demonstrate limited diagnostic utility. The present study aimed to compare the performances of fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB and to identify the most appropriate biomarker for these patients. The current study included 96 antiviral-naïve patients with CHB who underwent liver biopsy. METAVIR scoring system was used to assess liver fibrosis and necroinflammation. The diagnostic performances were evaluated of the platelet (PLT) count; the levels of hyaluronan, serum 7S domain of type 4 collagen, procollagen type III N-terminal peptide, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1, Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) and N-terminal type III collagen propeptide (Pro-C3); the fibrosis index based on four factors; the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index; and enhanced liver fibrosis score for identifying significant liver fibrosis [≥fibrosis stage 2 (F2)]. All fibrosis biomarkers, except the Pro-C3 level, correlated with the fibrosis stage. M2BPGi was better than other biomarkers for diagnosing ≥F2, with the highest area under the curve of 0.902. M2BPGi demonstrated a higher diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis than mild/severe fibrosis or cirrhosis. However, no significant correlation was observed between the M2BPGi level and fibrosis stage in patients with CHB having significant liver necroinflammation defined as ≥ necroinflammatory activity 2. The M2BPGi level and PLT count were exclusively correlated with the fibrosis stage in 73 patients without significant liver necroinflammation. M2BPGi demonstrated the highest diagnostic performance for significant fibrosis in patients having significant liver fibrosis with no significant liver necroinflammation. In conclusion, the M2BPGi level can accurately diagnose significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB.",

The optimal cut-off value of WFA+ -M2BP in predicting advanced fibrosis (F3-4) was 1.37 cut-off index (COI), yielding the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, and accuracy of 75.0, 79.4, 39.1, 94.7, and 78.7%, respectively (p < 0.001). Combining WFA+ -M2BP with FIB-4 significantly increased the diagnostic performance for advanced fibrosis, yielding specificity, PPV, and accuracy of 100, 100, and 93%, respectively. The significant factors predicting advanced liver fibrosis in the multivariate regression analysis were WFA+ -M2BP ≥ 1.37 COI (OR/confidence interval [CI]: 9.49/1.63-55.21, p = 0.01) and FIB-4 ≥ 2.80 (OR/CI: 38.18/4.89-297.93, p = 0.001). Monitoring WFA+ -M2BP is suitable for noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis in NASH patients, particularly in combination with FIB-4."

      "# Title: Asylum seekers, violence and health: a systematic review of research in high-income host countries.\n# Abstract: We performed a systematic review of literature on violence and related health concerns among asylum seekers in high-income host countries. We extracted data from 23 peer-reviewed studies. Prevalence of torture, variably defined, was above 30% across all studies. Torture history in clinic populations correlated with hunger and posttraumatic stress disorder, although in small, nonrepresentative samples. One study observed that previous exposure to interpersonal violence interacted with longer immigration detention periods, resulting in higher depression scores. Limited evidence suggests that asylum seekers frequently experience violence and health problems, but large-scale studies are needed to inform policies and services for this vulnerable group often at the center of political debate.",
      "# Title: Sexual and reproductive health of migrants: does the EU care?\n# Abstract: The European Union (EU) refers to health as a human right in many internal and external communications, policies and agreements, defending its universality. In parallel, specific health needs of migrants originating from outside the EU have been acknowledged. Yet, their right to health and in particular sexual and reproductive health (SRH) is currently not ensured throughout the EU. This paper reflects on the results of a comprehensive literature review on migrants' SRH in the EU applying the Critical Interpretive Synthesis review method. We highlight the discrepancy between a proclaimed rights-based approach to health and actual obstacles to migrants' attainment of good SRH. Uncertainties on entitlements of diverse migrant groups are fuelled by unclear legal provisions, creating significant barriers to access health systems in general and SRH services in particular. Furthermore, the rare strategies addressing migrants' health fail to address sexual health and are generally limited to perinatal care and HIV screening. Thus, future European public health policy-making should not only strongly encourage its Member States to ensure equal access to health care for migrants as for EU citizens, but also promote migrants' SRH effectively through a holistic and inclusive approach in SRH policies, prevention and care.",
      "# Title: Evaluating the impact of immigration policies on health status among undocumented immigrants: a systematic review.\n# Abstract: Over the past two decades, new anti-immigration policies and laws have emerged to address the migration of undocumented immigrants. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to assess and understand how these immigration policies and laws may affect both access to health services and health outcomes among undocumented immigrants. Eight databases were used to conduct this review, which returned 325 papers that were assessed for validity based on specified inclusion criteria. Forty critically appraised articles were selected for analysis; thirty articles related to access to health services, and ten related to health outcomes. The articles showed a direct relationship between anti-immigration policies and their effects on access to health services. In addition, as a result of these policies, undocumented immigrants were impacted by mental health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Action items were presented, including the promotion of cultural diversity training and the development of innovative strategies to support safety-net health care facilities serving vulnerable populations.",

      "# Title: Barriers and Facilitators to HIV Testing in Migrants in High-Income Countries: A Systematic Review.\n# Abstract: Migrants, particularly from low- and middle-income countries, are at a heightened risk of adverse HIV outcomes. HIV testing may improve these outcomes. We reviewed and synthesised studies into migrants and HIV testing (outcome variable), published between January 1997 and April 2014. Papers using quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods designs, and samples with adult (≥18 years) migrants from low- and middle-income countries in high-income countries were included in the paper. Of 3155 papers retrieved, 31 met the inclusion criteria and are included in the review. A large number of barriers and facilitators to HIV testing were identified across the individual, social and structural levels. A number of study design and methodological issues, however, inhibited a comprehensive synthesis. There is no doubt that addressing HIV testing in migrants in high-income countries is complex; however, it has important implications for individual, community and population health, and a strong, empirically based response is warranted.",

      "# Title: What the eye does not see: a critical interpretive synthesis of European Union policies addressing sexual violence in vulnerable migrants.\n# Abstract: In Europe, refugees, asylum seekers and undocumented migrants are more vulnerable to sexual victimisation than European citizens. They face more challenges when seeking care. This literature review examines how legal and policy frameworks at national, European and international levels condition the prevention of and response to sexual violence affecting these vulnerable migrant communities living in the European Union (EU). Applying the Critical Interpretive Synthesis method, we reviewed 187 legal and policy documents and 80 peer-reviewed articles on migrant sexual health for elements on sexual violence and further analysed the 37 legal and 12 peer-reviewed articles among them that specifically focused on sexual violence in vulnerable migrants in the EU-27 States. Legal and policy documents dealing with sexual violence, particularly but not exclusively in vulnerable migrants, apply 'tunnel vision'. They ignore: a) frequently occurring types of sexual violence, b) victimisation rates across genders and c) specific risk factors within the EU such as migrants' legal status, gender orientation and living conditions. The current EU policy-making paradigm relegates sexual violence in vulnerable migrants as an 'outsider' and 'female only' issue while EU migration and asylum policies reinforce its invisibility. Effective response must be guided by participatory rights- and evidence-based policies and a public health approach, acknowledging the occurrence and multiplicity of sexual victimisation of vulnerable migrants of all genders within EU borders.",
      "# Title: Human Trafficking in Ethiopia: A Scoping Review to Identify Gaps in Service Delivery, Research, and Policy.\n# Abstract: The purpose of this review is to integrate evidence on human trafficking in Ethiopia and identify gaps and recommendations for service delivery, research and training, and policy. A scoping literature review approach was used to systematically search nursing, medical, psychological, law, and international databases and synthesize information on a complex, understudied topic. The search yielded 826 articles, and 39 met the predetermined criteria for inclusion in the review. Trafficking in Ethiopia has occurred internally and externally in the form of adult and child labor and sex trafficking. There were also some reports of organ trafficking and other closely related human rights violations, such as child marriage, child soldiering, and exploitative intercountry adoption. Risk factors for trafficking included push factors (poverty, political instability, economic problems, and gender discrimination) and pull factors (demand for cheap labor). Trafficking was associated with poor health and economic outcomes for victims. Key recommendations for service delivery, research and training, and policy are identified, including establishing comprehensive services for survivor rehabilitation and reintegration, conducting quantitative health outcomes research, and reforming policy around migration and trafficking. Implementing the recommendations identified by this review will allow policy makers, researchers, and practitioners to take meaningful steps toward confronting human trafficking in Ethiopia.",

      "# Title: Factors Influencing the Accuracy of Infectious Disease Reporting in Migrants: A Scoping Review.\n# Abstract: We conducted a scoping review of literature to improve our understanding of the accuracy of infectious disease monitoring in migrants in the Europe. We searched PubMed for papers relevant to the topic including: case reports, observational and experimental studies, reviews, guidelines or policy documents; published after 1994. We identified 532 papers, 27 of which were included in the review. Legislation and right to access health care influence both the accuracy of rates and risk measures under estimating the at risk population, i.e., the denominator. Furthermore, the number of reported cases, i.e., the numerator, may also include cases not accounted for in the denominator. Both biases lead to an overestimated disease occurrence. Restriction to healthcare access and low responsiveness may cause under-detection of cases, however a quantification of this phenomenon has not been produced. On the contrary, screening for asymptomatic diseases increases ascertainment leading to increased detection of cases. Incompleteness of denominator data underestimates the at-risk population. In conclusion, most studies show a lower probability of under-reporting infectious diseases in migrants compared with native populations."

    "referenceConclusion": "Moderate level of evidence demonstrated that both R18 and R18D administration can significantly improve stroke outcomes in animal stroke models. However, considering the limitations, further pre‐clinical and clinical studies are warranted to substantiate the neuroprotective efficacy of polyarginines for stroke. The present study results showed promising effects regarding the efficacy of administering polyarginines of R18 and R18D in improving functional status and neurological outcomes and decreasing infarct size following the induction of stroke in rats. Moreover, R18 effectively reduced brain edema in animal models of stroke. All of the mentioned effects were supported by a moderate level of evidence. However, while these results are subjected to certain limitations, the pre‐clinical data are highly encouraging and provide the support for the translation of polyarginine peptides as possible clinical stroke therapeutics.",

      "# Title: Therapeutic effects of a reducible poly (oligo-D-arginine) carrier with the heme oxygenase-1 gene in the treatment of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.\n# Abstract: Non-viral carriers for gene therapy have been developed to minimize carrier cytotoxicity and to enhance transfection efficiency. Previously, we synthesized a 9-arginine-based reducible high molecular weight peptide for gene delivery. For the reducible poly(oligo-D-arginines) (rPOA), 9-arginine oligopeptides are connected by internal disulfide linkages to produce a high molecular weight peptide. In this study, rPOA was evaluated as a carrier of the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene for the treatment of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) -induced brain stroke. An in vitro transfection assay showed that rPOA had higher transfection efficiency and lower toxicity than polyethylenimine (PEI). For in vivo evaluation, I/R rat models were produced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). rPOA/HO-1 expression plasmid (pHO-1) polyplexes were injected into the brain at 1 h before MCAO, and HO-1 expression levels in the brain were then measured by ELISA. The results indicated that rPOA/pHO-1 polyplexes had higher transfection efficiencies than PEI/pHO-1 polyplexes. The rPOA/pHO-1 polyplexes significantly reduced infarct volumes. In addition, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) was reduced in the rPOA/pHO-1 polyplex injection group, suggesting that HO-1 had an anti-inflammatory effect, while the PEI/pHO-1 polyplex did not show this effect. These results suggest that rPOA is a potential non-viral vector for HO-1 gene therapy to protect brain cells from I/R-related neuronal injury including stroke.",
      "# Title: Poly-arginine and arginine-rich peptides are neuroprotective in stroke models.\n# Abstract: Using cortical neuronal cultures and glutamic acid excitotoxicity and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) stroke models, we demonstrated that poly-arginine and arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), are highly neuroprotective, with efficacy increasing with increasing arginine content, have the capacity to reduce glutamic acid-induced neuronal calcium influx and require heparan sulfate preotoglycan-mediated endocytosis to induce a neuroprotective effect. Furthermore, neuroprotection could be induced with immediate peptide treatment or treatment up to 2 to 4 hours before glutamic acid excitotoxicity or OGD, and with poly-arginine-9 (R9) when administered intravenously after stroke onset in a rat model. In contrast, the JNKI-1 peptide when fused to the (non-arginine) kFGF CPP, which does not rely on endocytosis for uptake, was not neuroprotective in the glutamic acid model; the kFGF peptide was also ineffective. Similarly, positively charged poly-lysine-10 (K10) and R9 fused to the negatively charged poly-glutamic acid-9 (E9) peptide (R9/E9) displayed minimal neuroprotection after excitotoxicity. These results indicate that peptide positive charge and arginine residues are critical for neuroprotection, and have led us to hypothesize that peptide-induced endocytic internalization of ion channels is a potential mechanism of action. The findings also question the mode of action of different neuroprotective peptides fused to arginine-rich CPPs.",

      "# Title: The R18 Polyarginine Peptide Is More Effective Than the TAT-NR2B9c (NA-1) Peptide When Administered 60 Minutes after Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in the Rat.\n# Abstract: We examined the dose responsiveness of polyarginine R18 (100, 300, and 1000 nmol/kg) when administered 60 minutes after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The TAT-NR2B9c peptide, which is known to be neuroprotective in rodent and nonhuman primate stroke models, served as a positive control. At 24 hours after MCAO, there was reduced total infarct volume in R18 treated animals at all doses, but this reduction only reached statistical significance at doses of 100 and 1000 nmol/kg. The TAT-NR2B9c peptide reduced infarct volume at doses of 300 and 1000 nmol/kg, but not to a statistically significant extent, while the 100 nmol/kg dose was ineffective. The reduction in infarct volume with R18 and TAT-NR2B9c peptide treatments was mirrored by improvements in one or more functional outcomes (namely, neurological score, adhesive tape removal, and rota-rod), but not to a statistically significant extent. These findings further confirm the neuroprotective properties of polyarginine peptides and for R18 extend its therapeutic time window and dose range, as well as demonstrating its greater efficacy compared to TAT-NR2B9c in a severe stroke model. The superior neuroprotective efficacy of R18 over TAT-NR2B9c highlights the potential of this polyarginine peptide as a lead candidate for studies in human stroke.",
      "# Title: Assessment of the Neuroprotective Effects of Arginine-Rich Protamine Peptides, Poly-Arginine Peptides (R12-Cyclic, R22) and Arginine-Tryptophan-Containing Peptides Following In Vitro Excitotoxicity and/or Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in Rats.\n# Abstract: We have demonstrated that arginine-rich and poly-arginine peptides possess potent neuroprotective properties with arginine content and peptide positive charge being particularly critical for neuroprotective efficacy. In addition, the presence of other amino acids within arginine-rich peptides, as well as chemical modifications, peptide length and cell-penetrating properties also influence the level of neuroprotection. Against this background, we have examined the neuroprotective efficacy of arginine-rich protamine peptides, a cyclic (R12-c) poly-arginine peptide and a R22 poly-arginine peptide, as well as arginine peptides containing tryptophan or other amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, glycine or leucine) in in vitro glutamic acid excitotoxicity and in vivo rat permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion models of stroke. In vitro studies demonstrated that protamine and poly-arginine peptides (R12-c, R22) were neuroprotective. Arginine-tryptophan-containing peptides were highly neuroprotective, with R12W8a being the most potent arginine-rich peptide identified in our laboratory. Peptides containing phenylalanine or tyrosine substituted in place of tryptophan in R12W8a were also highly neuroprotective, whereas leucine, and in particular glycine substitutions, decreased peptide efficacy. In vivo studies with protamine administered intravenously at 1000 nmol/kg 30 min after MCAO significantly reduced infarct volume and cerebral oedema by 22.5 and 38.6%, respectively. The R12W8a peptide was highly toxic when administered intravenously at 300 or 100 nmol/kg and ineffective at reducing infarct volume when administered at 30 nmol/kg 30 min after MCAO, unlike R18 (30 nmol/kg), which significantly reduced infarct volume by 20.4%. However, both R12W8a and R18 significantly reduced cerebral oedema by 19.8 and 42.2%, respectively. Protamine, R12W8a and R18 also reduced neuronal glutamic acid-induced calcium influx. These findings further highlight the neuroprotective properties of arginine-rich peptides and support the view that they represent a new class of neuroprotective agent.",
      "# Title: Delayed 2-h post-stroke administration of R18 and NA-1 (TAT-NR2B9c) peptides after permanent and/or transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat.\n# Abstract: Following positive results with the poly-arginine peptide R18 when administered intravenously 30 or 60min after permanent and/or transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO; 90min) in the rat, we examined the effectiveness of the peptide when administered 2h after MCAO. R18 was administered intravenously (1000nmol/kg via jugular vein) after permanent MCAO or a transient 3-h MCAO or when administered intra-arterially (100nmol/kg via internal carotid artery) immediately after reperfusion following a transient 2-h MCAO. In the transient MCAO studies, the neuroprotective NA-1 peptide was used as a positive control. Infarct volume, cerebral edema and functional outcomes were measured 24h after MCAO. Following permanent or transient MCAO, neither R18 nor NA-1 significantly reduced infarct volume. However, following permanent MCAO, R18 appeared to reduce cerebral edema (p=0.006), whereas following a transient 3-h MCAO, R18 improved the time to remove adhesive tape (p=0.04) without significantly affecting cerebral edema. There was also a trend (p=0.07) towards improved rota-rod performance with R18 in both permanent and transient 3-h MCAO. Following a transient 2-h MCAO, R18 had no significant effects on cerebral edema or neurological score but did lessen the extent of weight loss. Overall, while R18 had no effect on infarct volume, the peptide reduced cerebral edema after permanent MCAO, and improved some functional outcomes after transient MCAO.",
      "# Title: Warburg effect hypothesis in autism Spectrum disorders.\n# Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disease which is characterized by a deficit in social interactions and communication with repetitive and restrictive behavior. In altered cells, metabolic enzymes are modified by the dysregulation of the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway. In ASD, the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway is upregulated. We focus this review on the hypothesis of Warburg effect stimulated by the overexpression of the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway in ASD. Upregulation of WNT/β-catenin pathway induces aerobic glycolysis, named Warburg effect, through activation of glucose transporter (Glut), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1(PDK1), monocarboxylate lactate transporter 1 (MCT-1), lactate dehydrogenase kinase-A (LDH-A) and inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH). The aerobic glycolysis consists to a supply of a large part of glucose into lactate regardless of oxygen. Aerobic glycolysis is less efficient in terms of ATP production than oxidative phosphorylation because of the shunt of the TCA cycle. Dysregulation of energetic metabolism might promote cell deregulation and progression of ASD. Warburg effect regulation could be an attractive target for developing therapeutic interventions in ASD.",
      "# Title: Comparison of neuroprotective efficacy of poly-arginine R18 and R18D (D-enantiomer) peptides following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in the Wistar rat and in vitro toxicity studies.\n# Abstract: We have previously demonstrated that arginine-rich and poly-arginine peptides possess potent neuroprotective properties, with poly-arginine peptide R18 identified as being highly effective at reducing infarct volume following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the Sprague Dawley rat. Since peptides synthesised using D-isoform amino acids have greater stability than L-isoform peptides due to increased resistance to proteolytic degradation, they represent potentially more effective peptide therapeutics. Therefore we compared the neuroprotective efficacy of R18 and its D-enantiomer R18D following permanent MCAO in the Wistar rat. Furthermore, as increased peptide stability may also increase peptide toxicity, we examined the effects of R18 and R18D on cultured cortical neurons, astrocytes, brain endothelial cells (bEND.3), and embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) following a 10-minute or 24-hour peptide exposure duration. The in vivo studies demonstrated that R18D resulted in a greater reduction in mean infarct volume compared to R18 (33%, p = 0.004 vs 12%, p = 0.27) after intravenous administration at 300 nmol/kg 30 minutes after MCAO. Both R18D and R18 reduced cerebral hemisphere swelling to a comparable degree (27%, p = 0.03 and 30%, p = 0.02), and improved neurological assessment scores (1.5, p = 0.02 and 2, p = 0.058 vs 3 for vehicle). No abnormal histological findings specific to peptide treatments were observed in hematoxylin and eosin stained sections of kidney, liver, spleen, lung and heart. In vitro studies demonstrated that R18 and R18D were most toxic to neurons, followed by astrocytes, HEK293 and bEND.3 cells, but only at high concentrations and/or following 24-hour exposure. These findings further highlight the neuroprotective properties of poly-arginine peptides, and indicate that R18D at the dose examined is more potent than R18 in Wistar rats, and justify continued investigation of the R18 peptide as a novel neuroprotective agent for stroke.",
      "# Title: Assessment of therapeutic window for poly-arginine-18D (R18D) in a P7 rat model of perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy.\n# Abstract: Hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) remains the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in neonates, with no available neuroprotective therapeutic agent. In the development of a therapeutic for HIE, we examined the neuroprotective efficacy of the poly-arginine peptide R18D (arginine 18 mer synthesised with D-arginine) in a perinatal model of hypoxia-ischaemia (HI; common carotid and external carotid occlusion + 8%O2 /92%N2 for 2.5 hr) in the P7 Sprague-Dawley rat. R18D was administered intraperitoneally 30 min (doses 10, 30, 100, 300 and 1,000 nmol/kg), 60 min (doses 30 and 300 nmol/kg) or 120 min (doses 30 and 300 nmol/kg) after HI. Infarct volumes and behavioural outcomes were measured 48 hr after HI. When administered 30 min after HI, R18D at varying doses reduced infarct volume by 23.7% to 35.6% (p = 0.009 to < 0.0001) and resulted in improvements in the negative geotactic response and wire-hang times, at a dose of 30 nmol/kg. When administered 60 min after HI, R18D at the 30 nmol/kg dose reduced total infarct volume by 34.2% (p = 0.002), whilst the 300 nmol/kg dose improved wire-hang time. When administered 120 min after HI, R18D at the 30 and 300 nmol/kg doses had no significant impact on infarct volume, but the 300 nmol/kg dose improved the negative geotactic response. This study further confirms the neuroprotective properties of poly-arginine peptides, demonstrating that R18D can reduce infarct volume and improve behavioural outcomes after HI if administered up to 60 min after HI and improve behavioural outcomes up to 2 hr after HI.",
      "# Title: Poly-Arginine Peptides R18 and R18D Improve Functional Outcomes After Endothelin-1-Induced Stroke in the Sprague Dawley Rat.\n# Abstract: We have previously demonstrated that R18 and its d-enantiomer, R18D, are neuroprotective at 24 hours following intraluminal filament occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) in the rat. This study examined R18 and R18D effectiveness in improving functional outcomes at up to 56 days poststroke following endothelin-1-induced MCAO. Peptides were administered intravenously at doses of 100, 300, or 1000 nmol/kg, 60 minutes after MCAO. Functional recovery poststroke was assessed using multiple forelimb placing tests and horizontal ladder test, and NA-1 (TAT-NR2B9c), a neuroprotective currently in phase 3 clinical stroke trials, was used as a benchmark. The study demonstrated that R18 (300 and 1000 nmol/kg) was the most effective peptide in improving functional outcomes, followed by R18D (300 and 1000 nmol/kg), and NA-1 (300 and 100 nmol/kg). Furthermore, R18 at doses of 300 and 1000 nmol/kg was the most effective agent in restoring pre-stroke body weight, while R18 and R18D at doses of 300 and 1000 nmol/kg, but not NA-1 also significantly reduced the number of animals requiring hand feeding 48 hours after stroke. This study confirms that R18 and R18D are effective in improving long-term functional outcomes after stroke, and suggests that R18 may be more effective than NA-1.",
      "# Title: Comparative Assessment of the Proteolytic Stability and Impact of Poly-Arginine Peptides R18 and R18D on Infarct Growth and Penumbral Tissue Preservation Following Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in the Sprague Dawley Rat.\n# Abstract: Poly-arginine peptides R18 and R18D have previously been demonstrated to be neuroprotective in ischaemic stroke models. Here we examined the proteolytic stability and efficacy of R18 and R18D in reducing infarct core growth and preserving the ischaemic penumbra following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the Sprague Dawley rat. R18 (300 or 1000 nmol/kg), R18D (300 nmol/kg) or saline were administered intravenously 10 min after MCAO induced using a filament. Serial perfusion and diffusion-weighted MRI imaging was performed to measure changes in the infarct core and penumbra from time points between 45- and 225-min post-occlusion. Repeated measures analyses of infarct growth and penumbral tissue size were evaluated using generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs). R18D (300 nmol/kg) was most effective in slowing infarct core growth (46.8 mm3 reduction; p < 0.001) and preserving penumbral tissue (21.6% increase; p < 0.001), followed by R18 at the 300 nmol/kg dose (core: 29.5 mm3 reduction; p < 0.001, penumbra: 12.5% increase; p < 0.001). R18 at the 1000 nmol/kg dose had a significant impact in slowing core growth (19.5 mm3 reduction; p = 0.026), but only a modest impact on penumbral preservation (6.9% increase; p = 0.062). The in vitro anti-excitotoxic neuroprotective efficacy of R18D was also demonstrated to be unaffected when preincubated for 1-3 h or overnight, in a cell lysate prepared from dying neurons or with the proteolytic enzyme, plasmin, whereas the neuroprotective efficacy of R18 was significantly reduced after a 2-h incubation. These findings highlight the capacity of poly-arginine peptides to reduce infarct growth and preserve the ischaemic penumbra, and confirm the superior efficacy and proteolytic stability of R18D, which indicates that this peptide is likely to retain its neuroprotective properties when co-administered with alteplase during thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke."

    "referenceConclusion": "The primary goal of this review was to scope evidence regarding neurocognitive and neurophysiological functions that could be related to ACL injury in athletes and to synthesize them into RTS and rehabilitation paradigms. The existing evidence shows that cognitive skills and CNS functions may be linked to an increased injury risk and diminish postinjury performance in athletes. Cortical reorganization may demand compensatory strategies and occupy cognitive reserve, which makes it difficult to manage dynamic environment in sports. RTS and rehabilitation concepts should consider this notion to prevent second injuries and to achieve an adequate competitive level in athletes.",

      "# Title: Brain Activation for Knee Movement Measured Days Before Second Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury: Neuroimaging in Musculoskeletal Medicine.\n# Abstract: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury has multifactorial causes encompassing mechanical, hormonal, exposure, and anatomical factors. Alterations in the central nervous system also play a role, but their influence after injury, recovery, and recurrent injury remain unknown. Modern neuroimaging techniques can be used to elucidate the underlying functional and structural alterations of the brain that predicate the neuromuscular control adaptations associated with ACL injury. This knowledge will further our understanding of the neural adaptations after ACL injury and rehabilitation and in relation to injury risk. In this paper, we describe the measurement of brain activation during knee extension-flexion after ACL injury and reconstruction and 26 days before a contralateral ACL injury.",
      "# Title: Corticospinal and intracortical excitability differ between athletes early after ACLR and matched controls.\n# Abstract: Neuromuscular impairments, such as quadriceps weakness and activation deficits, persist after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Recent research demonstrating changes in the function of the primary motor cortex after ACLR posits that quadriceps impairments may be influenced by reduced corticospinal excitability. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the integrity of the neuromotor axis of the vastus medialis is altered in subjects 2 weeks post-ACLR compared to uninjured control subjects. Eighteen athletes 2 weeks post-ACLR and 18 age and sex matched uninjured control subjects participated in this cross-sectional study. We quantified corticospinal (resting motor threshold, RMT; motor evoked potential amplitudes at 120% RMT, MEP120 ) and intracortical (inhibition and facilitation) excitability using single and paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), respectively. We assessed spinal-reflex excitability (H-reflex amplitude normalized to maximal M-wave, H/M ratio) using peripheral stimulation. Subjects post-ACLR had higher RMTs (p = 0.001), greater MEP120 amplitudes (p = 0.001), and more asymmetric facilitation (p = 0.041) than the uninjured control subjects. No significant group differences were found for intracortical inhibition (p = 0.289) and H/M ratio (p = 0.332). Our findings indicate that both intracortical and corticospinal excitability of vastus medialis are bilaterally altered in subjects 2 weeks after ACLR. Given persistent neuromuscular deficits seen after ACLR, rehabilitation strategies targeting intracortical and corticospinal deficits may potentially improve clinical outcomes. © 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

      "# Title: Quadriceps muscle function following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: systemic differences in neural and morphological characteristics.\n# Abstract: Quadriceps muscle dysfunction is common following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Data considering the diversity of neural changes, in-concert with morphological adaptations of the quadriceps muscle, are lacking. We investigated bilateral differences in neural and morphological characteristics of the quadriceps muscle in ACLR participants (n = 11, month post-surgery: 69.4 ± 22.4) compared to controls matched by sex, age, height, weight, limb dominance, and activity level. Spinal reflex excitability was assessed using Hoffmann reflexes (H:M); corticospinal excitability was quantified via active motor thresholds (AMT) and motor-evoked potentials (MEP) using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Cortical activation was assessed using a knee flexion/extension task with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Muscle volume was quantified using structural MRI. Muscle strength and patient-reported outcomes were also collected. 2 × 2 RM ANOVAs were used to evaluate group differences. Smaller quadriceps muscle volume (total volume, rectus femoris, vastus medialis, and intermedius) and lower strength were detected compared to contralateral and control limbs. Individuals with ACLR reported higher levels of pain and fear and lower levels of knee function compared to controls. No differences were observed for H:M. ACLR individuals demonstrated higher AMT bilaterally and smaller MEPs in the injured limb, compared to the controls. ACLR participants demonstrated greater activation in frontal lobe areas responsible for motor and pain processing compared to controls, which were associated with self-reported pain. Our results suggest that individuals with ACLR demonstrate systemic neural differences compared to controls, which are observed concurrently with smaller quadriceps muscle volume, quadriceps muscle weakness, and self-reported dysfunction.",

      "# Title: Corticomotor function is associated with quadriceps rate of torque development in individuals with ACL surgery.\n# Abstract: Impaired corticomotor function arising from altered intracortical and corticospinal pathways are theorized to impede muscle recovery following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) surgery, yet functional implications of centrally driven adaptations remain unclear. We aimed to assess relationships between quadriceps corticomotor and neuromechanical function after ACL surgery, and to compare with contralateral and control limbs. 16 individuals after primary, unilateral ACL surgery and 16 sex- and age-matched controls participated. Corticomotor function was assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation, and quantified via active motor thresholds (AMT), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF). Neuromechanical function was quantified via electromechanical delay, early and late-phase rate of torque development (RTD0-50, RTD100-200), coefficient of variation, maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) torque, and central activation ratio. We observed significant correlations in the ACL limbs between: AMT and RTD0-50 (r = - 0.513, p = 0.031), SICI and RTD100-200 (r = 0.501, p = 0.048), AMT and SICI (r = - 0.659, p = 0.010), AMT and ICF (r = 0.579, p = 0.031), RTD0-50 and MVIC (r = 0.504, p = 0.023), and RTD100-200 and MVIC (r = 0.680, p = 0.002). The ACL limbs demonstrated higher AMT compared to controls (44.9 ± 8.4 vs. 30.1 ± 8.2%, p < 0.001), and lesser MVIC torque (2.37 ± 0.52 vs. 2.80 ± 0.59 Nm/kg, p = 0.005) and RTD100-200 (6.79 ± 1.72 vs. 7.90 ± 1.98 Nm/kg/s, p = 0.006) compared to the contralateral limbs. Our findings indicate that lesser corticospinal excitability is associated with lesser early-phase RTD, and greater intracortical inhibition is associated with lesser late-phase RTD. These findings provide evidence of implications of altered intracortical and corticospinal pathways relative to the ability to rapidly generate quadriceps torque following ACL surgery.",

      "# Title: Athletes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction demonstrate asymmetric intracortical facilitation early after surgery.\n# Abstract: Quadriceps dysfunction persists after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), yet the etiology remains elusive. Inhibitory and facilitatory intracortical networks (ie, intracortical excitability) may be involved in quadriceps dysfunction, yet the investigation of these networks early after ACLR is sparse. The purposes of this study were to examine (a) changes in intracortical excitability in athletes after ACLR compared to uninjured athletes during the course of postoperative rehabilitation, (b) the association between intracortical excitability and quadriceps strength in athletes after ACLR. Eighteen level I/II athletes after ACLR between the ages of 18 to 30 years and eighteen healthy sex, age, and activity matched athletes were tested at three-time points: (a) 2 weeks after surgery, (b) achievement of a \"quiet knee\" defined as full range of motion and minimal effusion, (c) return to running time point defined as achievement of a quadriceps index ≥80% and at least 12 weeks post-ACLR. Short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF), measured via transcranial magnetic stimulation and isometric quadriceps strength were examined bilaterally at each time point. There was a significant group × limb interaction (P = .017) for ICF. The ACLR group demonstrated asymmetric ICF (greater in the nonsurgical limb) compared to controls and a significant relationship between SICI and quadriceps strength of the surgical limb at the quiet knee time point (P = .018). ACLR individuals demonstrate differential effects on ICF between limbs. Also, SICI is associated with isometric quadriceps strength after ACLR, suggesting increased inhibition of the motor cortex may contribute to impaired quadriceps strength following ACLR.",

      "# Title: Neural activity for hip-knee control in those with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A task-based functional connectivity analysis.\n# Abstract: Anterior cruciate ligament injury may induce neurophysiological changes for sensorimotor control. Neuroimaging investigations have revealed unique brain activity patterns for knee movement following injury, indicating potential neural mechanisms underlying aberrant neuromuscular control that may contribute to heightened risk of secondary injury, altered movement patterns and poor patient outcomes. However, neuroimaging paradigms thus far have been limited to single joint, single motion knee tasks. Therefore, we sought to overcome prior limitations to understand the effects of injury on neural control of lower extremity movement by employing a multi-joint motor paradigm and determining differences in neural activity between ACL-reconstructed (ACLr) individuals relative to healthy matched controls. Fifteen patients with left anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and fifteen matched healthy controls participated in this study. Neural activity was examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging during a block-designed knee-hip movement paradigm (similar to a supine heel-slide). Participants for each group were monitored and task performance was controlled via a metronome to ensure the same spatial-temporal parameters. We observed that those with ACL reconstruction displayed increased activation within the intracalcarine cortex, lingual gyrus, occipital fusiform gyrus, lateral occipital cortex, angular gyrus, and superior parietal lobule relative to controls. A follow-up task-based functional connectivity analyses using seed regions identified from the group analysis revealed connectivity among fronto-insular-temporal and sensorimotor regions within the ACLr participants. The results of this fMRI investigation suggest ACLr individuals require increased activity and connectivity in areas responsible for visual-spatial cognition and orientation, and attention for hip and knee motor control."

The objective of our study was to evaluate the prognostic role of baseline NLR and change in NLR (ΔNLR) in advanced pancreatic cancer underwent chemotherapy. Between January 2010 and June 2015, 132 patients underwent chemotherapy were eligible for assessment. Based on our patients' data, the cut-off value of NLR was 2.78 according to receiver operating characteristic curve. We observed that a high level of baseline NLR (NLR > 2.78) was a poor prognostic factor for overall survival (multivariable hazard ratio [HR] = 2.648, P < 0.001). Increased NLR (ΔNLR > 0) after 2 cycles of chemotherapy was associated with higher risk compared to ΔNLR ≤ 0 (multivariable HR = 1.894, P = 0.007). Combining both NLR and ΔNLR factors, multivariate analysis showed a significant higher risk (HR = 5.817, P < 0.001) for patients with high baseline NLR and increased NLR after 2 cycles of chemotherapy compared to patients with low baseline NLR and ΔNLR ≤ 0.

Our objective was to determine if mFI predicts morbidity and mortality in the diverse national cohort of patients undergoing neurosurgery for intracranial neoplasms. We identified patients in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program who underwent oncologic neurosurgery procedures between 2008 and 2012. The mFI, ranging from 0 to 1, was calculated as the proportion of 11 possible risk factors present. We assessed the associations between mFI and 30-day mortality, neurologic and medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge in univariate and multivariable analyses and compare the index to established risk stratification techniques. A total of 9149 patients were identified. Mortality, severe medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge increased incrementally with increasing levels of frailty. Severe neurologic complications were highest in those with low frailty. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, increased frailty increased the odds of all adverse outcomes, including neurologic complications. The mFI increased the ability to predict all outcomes beyond available indices and was the most reliable predictor of neurologic complications. The mFI can be calculated from routinely collected medical record data and is predictive of 30-day adverse outcomes in a wide variety of neurosurgical oncology patients. The index may be a useful component of preoperative risk assessment with implications for shared decision-making, perioperative planning, and risk adjusted outcomes measurement in national quality registries.",

In multivariate logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, BMI, ASA classification, smoking status, dyspnea, significant pre-operative weight loss, chronic steroid use, bleeding disorder, tumor type, and operative time, low frailty was associated with increased adjusted odds ratio of major complication (1.41, 95% CI: 1.23-1.60, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.32, 95% CI: 1.20-1.46, p < 0.001), 30-day readmission (1.29, 95% CI: 1.15-1.44, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (1.87, 95% CI: 1.41-2.47, p < 0.001). Moderate-to-high frailty was also associated with increased adjusted odds of major complication (1.61, 95% CI: 1.35-1.92, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.80, 95% CI: 1.58-2.05), 30-day readmission (1.39, 95% CI: 1.19-1.62, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (2.42, 95% CI: 1.74-3.38, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is associated with increased odds of major post-operative complication, discharge to destination other than home, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality.",

A randomized, single-blind study was performed to evaluate the effects of the combination of high-dose furosemide and small-volume hypertonic saline solution (HSS) infusion in the treatment of refractory New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV CHF and a normosodic diet during follow-up. Materials and Methods One hundred seven patients (39 women and 68 men, age range 65-90 years) with refractory CHF (NYHA class IV) of different etiologies, who were unresponsive to high oral doses of furosemide, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digitalis, and nitrates, were enrolled. Inclusion criteria included an ejection fraction (EF) <35%, serum creatinine level <2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level < or =60 mg/dL, reduced urinary volume, and low natriuresis. The patients were randomized in 2 groups (single-blind). Patients in group 1 (20 women and 33 men) received an intravenous (IV) infusion of furosemide (500-1000 mg) plus HSS (150 mL of 1.4%-4.6% NACl) twice a day in 30 minutes. Patients in group 2 (19 women and 35 men) received an IV bolus of furosemide (500-1000 mg) twice a day, without HSS, during a period lasting 6 to 12 days. Both groups received IV KCl (20-40 mEq) to prevent hypokalemia. At study entry, all patients underwent a physical examination and measurement of body weight (BW), blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR), an evaluation of signs of CHF, and measurement of control levels of serum Na, K, Cl, bicarbonate, albumin, uric acid, creatinine, urea, and glycemia daily during hospitalization, and measurements of the daily output of urine for Na, K, and Cl. A chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram were obtained at study entry, during hospitalization, and at the time of discharge from the hospital. During the treatment and after discharge, the daily dietary Na intake was 120 mmol in group 1 versus 80 mmol in group 2, with a fluid intake of 1000 mL daily in both groups. An assessment of BW and 24-hour urinary volume, serum, and urinary laboratory parameters were performed daily until patients reached a compensated state, when IV furosemide was replaced with oral administration (250-500 mg/d). After discharge from the hospital, patients were observed as outpatients weekly for the first 3 months and, subsequently, once a month.",

Both groups had normal sodium (120 mmol sodium) intake. After discharge, the two groups continued to receive 120 mmol Na/day and 500-1000 mL water/day.The first group (132 C-HSS patients) had an increase in urination, a reduction in hospitalization time (4 ± 2 versus 7 ± 2 days, P < 0.01), and a reduction in hospitalization costs (2210 RMB versus 3506 RMB, P < 0.01) compared with the second group (132 without C-HSS patients). During the follow-up period (36 ± 12 months), the first group had a significantly higher average readmission time (31.84 ± 7.58 months versus 15.60 ± 6.25 months, P < 0.01) and lower mortality rate (16.5% versus 31.9%, P < 0.01).The results suggest that periodical C-HSS administration, combined with serious water restriction and a normal sodium diet, significantly reduces the hospitalization time, readmission rate, and mortality in patients with NYHA class III HF."

Torture history in clinic populations correlated with hunger and posttraumatic stress disorder, although in small, nonrepresentative samples. One study observed that previous exposure to interpersonal violence interacted with longer immigration detention periods, resulting in higher depression scores. Limited evidence suggests that asylum seekers frequently experience violence and health problems, but large-scale studies are needed to inform policies and services for this vulnerable group often at the center of political debate.",
      "# Title: Sexual and reproductive health of migrants: does the EU care?\n# Abstract: The European Union (EU) refers to health as a human right in many internal and external communications, policies and agreements, defending its universality. In parallel, specific health needs of migrants originating from outside the EU have been acknowledged. Yet, their right to health and in particular sexual and reproductive health (SRH) is currently not ensured throughout the EU. This paper reflects on the results of a comprehensive literature review on migrants' SRH in the EU applying the Critical Interpretive Synthesis review method. We highlight the discrepancy between a proclaimed rights-based approach to health and actual obstacles to migrants' attainment of good SRH. Uncertainties on entitlements of diverse migrant groups are fuelled by unclear legal provisions, creating significant barriers to access health systems in general and SRH services in particular. Furthermore, the rare strategies addressing migrants' health fail to address sexual health and are generally limited to perinatal care and HIV screening. Thus, future European public health policy-making should not only strongly encourage its Member States to ensure equal access to health care for migrants as for EU citizens, but also promote migrants' SRH effectively through a holistic and inclusive approach in SRH policies, prevention and care.",
      "# Title: Evaluating the impact of immigration policies on health status among undocumented immigrants: a systematic review.\n# Abstract: Over the past two decades, new anti-immigration policies and laws have emerged to address the migration of undocumented immigrants. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to assess and understand how these immigration policies and laws may affect both access to health services and health outcomes among undocumented immigrants. Eight databases were used to conduct this review, which returned 325 papers that were assessed for validity based on specified inclusion criteria. Forty critically appraised articles were selected for analysis; thirty articles related to access to health services, and ten related to health outcomes. The articles showed a direct relationship between anti-immigration policies and their effects on access to health services. In addition, as a result of these policies, undocumented immigrants were impacted by mental health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Action items were presented, including the promotion of cultural diversity training and the development of innovative strategies to support safety-net health care facilities serving vulnerable populations.",

      "# Title: Barriers and Facilitators to HIV Testing in Migrants in High-Income Countries: A Systematic Review.\n# Abstract: Migrants, particularly from low- and middle-income countries, are at a heightened risk of adverse HIV outcomes. HIV testing may improve these outcomes. We reviewed and synthesised studies into migrants and HIV testing (outcome variable), published between January 1997 and April 2014. Papers using quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods designs, and samples with adult (≥18 years) migrants from low- and middle-income countries in high-income countries were included in the paper. Of 3155 papers retrieved, 31 met the inclusion criteria and are included in the review. A large number of barriers and facilitators to HIV testing were identified across the individual, social and structural levels. A number of study design and methodological issues, however, inhibited a comprehensive synthesis. There is no doubt that addressing HIV testing in migrants in high-income countries is complex; however, it has important implications for individual, community and population health, and a strong, empirically based response is warranted.",

      "# Title: What the eye does not see: a critical interpretive synthesis of European Union policies addressing sexual violence in vulnerable migrants.\n# Abstract: In Europe, refugees, asylum seekers and undocumented migrants are more vulnerable to sexual victimisation than European citizens. They face more challenges when seeking care. This literature review examines how legal and policy frameworks at national, European and international levels condition the prevention of and response to sexual violence affecting these vulnerable migrant communities living in the European Union (EU). Applying the Critical Interpretive Synthesis method, we reviewed 187 legal and policy documents and 80 peer-reviewed articles on migrant sexual health for elements on sexual violence and further analysed the 37 legal and 12 peer-reviewed articles among them that specifically focused on sexual violence in vulnerable migrants in the EU-27 States. Legal and policy documents dealing with sexual violence, particularly but not exclusively in vulnerable migrants, apply 'tunnel vision'. They ignore: a) frequently occurring types of sexual violence, b) victimisation rates across genders and c) specific risk factors within the EU such as migrants' legal status, gender orientation and living conditions. The current EU policy-making paradigm relegates sexual violence in vulnerable migrants as an 'outsider' and 'female only' issue while EU migration and asylum policies reinforce its invisibility. Effective response must be guided by participatory rights- and evidence-based policies and a public health approach, acknowledging the occurrence and multiplicity of sexual victimisation of vulnerable migrants of all genders within EU borders.",
      "# Title: Human Trafficking in Ethiopia: A Scoping Review to Identify Gaps in Service Delivery, Research, and Policy.\n# Abstract: The purpose of this review is to integrate evidence on human trafficking in Ethiopia and identify gaps and recommendations for service delivery, research and training, and policy. A scoping literature review approach was used to systematically search nursing, medical, psychological, law, and international databases and synthesize information on a complex, understudied topic. The search yielded 826 articles, and 39 met the predetermined criteria for inclusion in the review. Trafficking in Ethiopia has occurred internally and externally in the form of adult and child labor and sex trafficking. There were also some reports of organ trafficking and other closely related human rights violations, such as child marriage, child soldiering, and exploitative intercountry adoption. Risk factors for trafficking included push factors (poverty, political instability, economic problems, and gender discrimination) and pull factors (demand for cheap labor). Trafficking was associated with poor health and economic outcomes for victims. Key recommendations for service delivery, research and training, and policy are identified, including establishing comprehensive services for survivor rehabilitation and reintegration, conducting quantitative health outcomes research, and reforming policy around migration and trafficking. Implementing the recommendations identified by this review will allow policy makers, researchers, and practitioners to take meaningful steps toward confronting human trafficking in Ethiopia.",

      "# Title: Factors Influencing the Accuracy of Infectious Disease Reporting in Migrants: A Scoping Review.\n# Abstract: We conducted a scoping review of literature to improve our understanding of the accuracy of infectious disease monitoring in migrants in the Europe. We searched PubMed for papers relevant to the topic including: case reports, observational and experimental studies, reviews, guidelines or policy documents; published after 1994. We identified 532 papers, 27 of which were included in the review. Legislation and right to access health care influence both the accuracy of rates and risk measures under estimating the at risk population, i.e., the denominator. Furthermore, the number of reported cases, i.e., the numerator, may also include cases not accounted for in the denominator. Both biases lead to an overestimated disease occurrence. Restriction to healthcare access and low responsiveness may cause under-detection of cases, however a quantification of this phenomenon has not been produced. On the contrary, screening for asymptomatic diseases increases ascertainment leading to increased detection of cases. Incompleteness of denominator data underestimates the at-risk population. In conclusion, most studies show a lower probability of under-reporting infectious diseases in migrants compared with native populations."

      "# Title: Therapeutic effects of a reducible poly (oligo-D-arginine) carrier with the heme oxygenase-1 gene in the treatment of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.\n# Abstract: Non-viral carriers for gene therapy have been developed to minimize carrier cytotoxicity and to enhance transfection efficiency. Previously, we synthesized a 9-arginine-based reducible high molecular weight peptide for gene delivery. For the reducible poly(oligo-D-arginines) (rPOA), 9-arginine oligopeptides are connected by internal disulfide linkages to produce a high molecular weight peptide. In this study, rPOA was evaluated as a carrier of the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene for the treatment of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) -induced brain stroke. An in vitro transfection assay showed that rPOA had higher transfection efficiency and lower toxicity than polyethylenimine (PEI). For in vivo evaluation, I/R rat models were produced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). rPOA/HO-1 expression plasmid (pHO-1) polyplexes were injected into the brain at 1 h before MCAO, and HO-1 expression levels in the brain were then measured by ELISA. The results indicated that rPOA/pHO-1 polyplexes had higher transfection efficiencies than PEI/pHO-1 polyplexes. The rPOA/pHO-1 polyplexes significantly reduced infarct volumes. In addition, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) was reduced in the rPOA/pHO-1 polyplex injection group, suggesting that HO-1 had an anti-inflammatory effect, while the PEI/pHO-1 polyplex did not show this effect. These results suggest that rPOA is a potential non-viral vector for HO-1 gene therapy to protect brain cells from I/R-related neuronal injury including stroke.",
      "# Title: Poly-arginine and arginine-rich peptides are neuroprotective in stroke models.\n# Abstract: Using cortical neuronal cultures and glutamic acid excitotoxicity and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) stroke models, we demonstrated that poly-arginine and arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), are highly neuroprotective, with efficacy increasing with increasing arginine content, have the capacity to reduce glutamic acid-induced neuronal calcium influx and require heparan sulfate preotoglycan-mediated endocytosis to induce a neuroprotective effect. Furthermore, neuroprotection could be induced with immediate peptide treatment or treatment up to 2 to 4 hours before glutamic acid excitotoxicity or OGD, and with poly-arginine-9 (R9) when administered intravenously after stroke onset in a rat model. In contrast, the JNKI-1 peptide when fused to the (non-arginine) kFGF CPP, which does not rely on endocytosis for uptake, was not neuroprotective in the glutamic acid model; the kFGF peptide was also ineffective. Similarly, positively charged poly-lysine-10 (K10) and R9 fused to the negatively charged poly-glutamic acid-9 (E9) peptide (R9/E9) displayed minimal neuroprotection after excitotoxicity. These results indicate that peptide positive charge and arginine residues are critical for neuroprotection, and have led us to hypothesize that peptide-induced endocytic internalization of ion channels is a potential mechanism of action. The findings also question the mode of action of different neuroprotective peptides fused to arginine-rich CPPs.",

      "# Title: The R18 Polyarginine Peptide Is More Effective Than the TAT-NR2B9c (NA-1) Peptide When Administered 60 Minutes after Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in the Rat.\n# Abstract: We examined the dose responsiveness of polyarginine R18 (100, 300, and 1000 nmol/kg) when administered 60 minutes after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The TAT-NR2B9c peptide, which is known to be neuroprotective in rodent and nonhuman primate stroke models, served as a positive control. At 24 hours after MCAO, there was reduced total infarct volume in R18 treated animals at all doses, but this reduction only reached statistical significance at doses of 100 and 1000 nmol/kg. The TAT-NR2B9c peptide reduced infarct volume at doses of 300 and 1000 nmol/kg, but not to a statistically significant extent, while the 100 nmol/kg dose was ineffective. The reduction in infarct volume with R18 and TAT-NR2B9c peptide treatments was mirrored by improvements in one or more functional outcomes (namely, neurological score, adhesive tape removal, and rota-rod), but not to a statistically significant extent. These findings further confirm the neuroprotective properties of polyarginine peptides and for R18 extend its therapeutic time window and dose range, as well as demonstrating its greater efficacy compared to TAT-NR2B9c in a severe stroke model. The superior neuroprotective efficacy of R18 over TAT-NR2B9c highlights the potential of this polyarginine peptide as a lead candidate for studies in human stroke.",
      "# Title: Assessment of the Neuroprotective Effects of Arginine-Rich Protamine Peptides, Poly-Arginine Peptides (R12-Cyclic, R22) and Arginine-Tryptophan-Containing Peptides Following In Vitro Excitotoxicity and/or Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in Rats.\n# Abstract: We have demonstrated that arginine-rich and poly-arginine peptides possess potent neuroprotective properties with arginine content and peptide positive charge being particularly critical for neuroprotective efficacy. In addition, the presence of other amino acids within arginine-rich peptides, as well as chemical modifications, peptide length and cell-penetrating properties also influence the level of neuroprotection. Against this background, we have examined the neuroprotective efficacy of arginine-rich protamine peptides, a cyclic (R12-c) poly-arginine peptide and a R22 poly-arginine peptide, as well as arginine peptides containing tryptophan or other amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, glycine or leucine) in in vitro glutamic acid excitotoxicity and in vivo rat permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion models of stroke. In vitro studies demonstrated that protamine and poly-arginine peptides (R12-c, R22) were neuroprotective. Arginine-tryptophan-containing peptides were highly neuroprotective, with R12W8a being the most potent arginine-rich peptide identified in our laboratory. Peptides containing phenylalanine or tyrosine substituted in place of tryptophan in R12W8a were also highly neuroprotective, whereas leucine, and in particular glycine substitutions, decreased peptide efficacy. In vivo studies with protamine administered intravenously at 1000 nmol/kg 30 min after MCAO significantly reduced infarct volume and cerebral oedema by 22.5 and 38.6%, respectively. The R12W8a peptide was highly toxic when administered intravenously at 300 or 100 nmol/kg and ineffective at reducing infarct volume when administered at 30 nmol/kg 30 min after MCAO, unlike R18 (30 nmol/kg), which significantly reduced infarct volume by 20.4%. However, both R12W8a and R18 significantly reduced cerebral oedema by 19.8 and 42.2%, respectively. Protamine, R12W8a and R18 also reduced neuronal glutamic acid-induced calcium influx. These findings further highlight the neuroprotective properties of arginine-rich peptides and support the view that they represent a new class of neuroprotective agent.",
      "# Title: Delayed 2-h post-stroke administration of R18 and NA-1 (TAT-NR2B9c) peptides after permanent and/or transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat.\n# Abstract: Following positive results with the poly-arginine peptide R18 when administered intravenously 30 or 60min after permanent and/or transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO; 90min) in the rat, we examined the effectiveness of the peptide when administered 2h after MCAO. R18 was administered intravenously (1000nmol/kg via jugular vein) after permanent MCAO or a transient 3-h MCAO or when administered intra-arterially (100nmol/kg via internal carotid artery) immediately after reperfusion following a transient 2-h MCAO. In the transient MCAO studies, the neuroprotective NA-1 peptide was used as a positive control. Infarct volume, cerebral edema and functional outcomes were measured 24h after MCAO. Following permanent or transient MCAO, neither R18 nor NA-1 significantly reduced infarct volume. However, following permanent MCAO, R18 appeared to reduce cerebral edema (p=0.006), whereas following a transient 3-h MCAO, R18 improved the time to remove adhesive tape (p=0.04) without significantly affecting cerebral edema. There was also a trend (p=0.07) towards improved rota-rod performance with R18 in both permanent and transient 3-h MCAO. Following a transient 2-h MCAO, R18 had no significant effects on cerebral edema or neurological score but did lessen the extent of weight loss. Overall, while R18 had no effect on infarct volume, the peptide reduced cerebral edema after permanent MCAO, and improved some functional outcomes after transient MCAO.",
      "# Title: Warburg effect hypothesis in autism Spectrum disorders.\n# Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disease which is characterized by a deficit in social interactions and communication with repetitive and restrictive behavior. In altered cells, metabolic enzymes are modified by the dysregulation of the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway. In ASD, the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway is upregulated. We focus this review on the hypothesis of Warburg effect stimulated by the overexpression of the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway in ASD. Upregulation of WNT/β-catenin pathway induces aerobic glycolysis, named Warburg effect, through activation of glucose transporter (Glut), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1(PDK1), monocarboxylate lactate transporter 1 (MCT-1), lactate dehydrogenase kinase-A (LDH-A) and inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH). The aerobic glycolysis consists to a supply of a large part of glucose into lactate regardless of oxygen. Aerobic glycolysis is less efficient in terms of ATP production than oxidative phosphorylation because of the shunt of the TCA cycle. Dysregulation of energetic metabolism might promote cell deregulation and progression of ASD. Warburg effect regulation could be an attractive target for developing therapeutic interventions in ASD.",
      "# Title: Comparison of neuroprotective efficacy of poly-arginine R18 and R18D (D-enantiomer) peptides following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in the Wistar rat and in vitro toxicity studies.\n# Abstract: We have previously demonstrated that arginine-rich and poly-arginine peptides possess potent neuroprotective properties, with poly-arginine peptide R18 identified as being highly effective at reducing infarct volume following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the Sprague Dawley rat. Since peptides synthesised using D-isoform amino acids have greater stability than L-isoform peptides due to increased resistance to proteolytic degradation, they represent potentially more effective peptide therapeutics. Therefore we compared the neuroprotective efficacy of R18 and its D-enantiomer R18D following permanent MCAO in the Wistar rat. Furthermore, as increased peptide stability may also increase peptide toxicity, we examined the effects of R18 and R18D on cultured cortical neurons, astrocytes, brain endothelial cells (bEND.3), and embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) following a 10-minute or 24-hour peptide exposure duration. The in vivo studies demonstrated that R18D resulted in a greater reduction in mean infarct volume compared to R18 (33%, p = 0.004 vs 12%, p = 0.27) after intravenous administration at 300 nmol/kg 30 minutes after MCAO. Both R18D and R18 reduced cerebral hemisphere swelling to a comparable degree (27%, p = 0.03 and 30%, p = 0.02), and improved neurological assessment scores (1.5, p = 0.02 and 2, p = 0.058 vs 3 for vehicle). No abnormal histological findings specific to peptide treatments were observed in hematoxylin and eosin stained sections of kidney, liver, spleen, lung and heart. In vitro studies demonstrated that R18 and R18D were most toxic to neurons, followed by astrocytes, HEK293 and bEND.3 cells, but only at high concentrations and/or following 24-hour exposure. These findings further highlight the neuroprotective properties of poly-arginine peptides, and indicate that R18D at the dose examined is more potent than R18 in Wistar rats, and justify continued investigation of the R18 peptide as a novel neuroprotective agent for stroke.",
      "# Title: Assessment of therapeutic window for poly-arginine-18D (R18D) in a P7 rat model of perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy.\n# Abstract: Hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) remains the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in neonates, with no available neuroprotective therapeutic agent. In the development of a therapeutic for HIE, we examined the neuroprotective efficacy of the poly-arginine peptide R18D (arginine 18 mer synthesised with D-arginine) in a perinatal model of hypoxia-ischaemia (HI; common carotid and external carotid occlusion + 8%O2 /92%N2 for 2.5 hr) in the P7 Sprague-Dawley rat. R18D was administered intraperitoneally 30 min (doses 10, 30, 100, 300 and 1,000 nmol/kg), 60 min (doses 30 and 300 nmol/kg) or 120 min (doses 30 and 300 nmol/kg) after HI. Infarct volumes and behavioural outcomes were measured 48 hr after HI. When administered 30 min after HI, R18D at varying doses reduced infarct volume by 23.7% to 35.6% (p = 0.009 to < 0.0001) and resulted in improvements in the negative geotactic response and wire-hang times, at a dose of 30 nmol/kg. When administered 60 min after HI, R18D at the 30 nmol/kg dose reduced total infarct volume by 34.2% (p = 0.002), whilst the 300 nmol/kg dose improved wire-hang time. When administered 120 min after HI, R18D at the 30 and 300 nmol/kg doses had no significant impact on infarct volume, but the 300 nmol/kg dose improved the negative geotactic response. This study further confirms the neuroprotective properties of poly-arginine peptides, demonstrating that R18D can reduce infarct volume and improve behavioural outcomes after HI if administered up to 60 min after HI and improve behavioural outcomes up to 2 hr after HI.",
      "# Title: Poly-Arginine Peptides R18 and R18D Improve Functional Outcomes After Endothelin-1-Induced Stroke in the Sprague Dawley Rat.\n# Abstract: We have previously demonstrated that R18 and its d-enantiomer, R18D, are neuroprotective at 24 hours following intraluminal filament occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) in the rat. This study examined R18 and R18D effectiveness in improving functional outcomes at up to 56 days poststroke following endothelin-1-induced MCAO. Peptides were administered intravenously at doses of 100, 300, or 1000 nmol/kg, 60 minutes after MCAO. Functional recovery poststroke was assessed using multiple forelimb placing tests and horizontal ladder test, and NA-1 (TAT-NR2B9c), a neuroprotective currently in phase 3 clinical stroke trials, was used as a benchmark. The study demonstrated that R18 (300 and 1000 nmol/kg) was the most effective peptide in improving functional outcomes, followed by R18D (300 and 1000 nmol/kg), and NA-1 (300 and 100 nmol/kg). Furthermore, R18 at doses of 300 and 1000 nmol/kg was the most effective agent in restoring pre-stroke body weight, while R18 and R18D at doses of 300 and 1000 nmol/kg, but not NA-1 also significantly reduced the number of animals requiring hand feeding 48 hours after stroke. This study confirms that R18 and R18D are effective in improving long-term functional outcomes after stroke, and suggests that R18 may be more effective than NA-1.",
      "# Title: Comparative Assessment of the Proteolytic Stability and Impact of Poly-Arginine Peptides R18 and R18D on Infarct Growth and Penumbral Tissue Preservation Following Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in the Sprague Dawley Rat.\n# Abstract: Poly-arginine peptides R18 and R18D have previously been demonstrated to be neuroprotective in ischaemic stroke models. Here we examined the proteolytic stability and efficacy of R18 and R18D in reducing infarct core growth and preserving the ischaemic penumbra following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the Sprague Dawley rat. R18 (300 or 1000 nmol/kg), R18D (300 nmol/kg) or saline were administered intravenously 10 min after MCAO induced using a filament. Serial perfusion and diffusion-weighted MRI imaging was performed to measure changes in the infarct core and penumbra from time points between 45- and 225-min post-occlusion. Repeated measures analyses of infarct growth and penumbral tissue size were evaluated using generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs). R18D (300 nmol/kg) was most effective in slowing infarct core growth (46.8 mm3 reduction; p < 0.001) and preserving penumbral tissue (21.6% increase; p < 0.001), followed by R18 at the 300 nmol/kg dose (core: 29.5 mm3 reduction; p < 0.001, penumbra: 12.5% increase; p < 0.001). R18 at the 1000 nmol/kg dose had a significant impact in slowing core growth (19.5 mm3 reduction; p = 0.026), but only a modest impact on penumbral preservation (6.9% increase; p = 0.062). The in vitro anti-excitotoxic neuroprotective efficacy of R18D was also demonstrated to be unaffected when preincubated for 1-3 h or overnight, in a cell lysate prepared from dying neurons or with the proteolytic enzyme, plasmin, whereas the neuroprotective efficacy of R18 was significantly reduced after a 2-h incubation. These findings highlight the capacity of poly-arginine peptides to reduce infarct growth and preserve the ischaemic penumbra, and confirm the superior efficacy and proteolytic stability of R18D, which indicates that this peptide is likely to retain its neuroprotective properties when co-administered with alteplase during thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke."

      "# Title: Thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications in essential thrombocythemia. A retrospective study of 103 patients.\n# Abstract: A retrospective study of 103 patients with essential thrombocythemia was carried out to evaluate the incidence of thrombohemorrhagic complications and establish whether there were any correlations between these events and clinical or laboratory data. At onset or during the course of the disease, 26 patients (25.2%) presented thrombotic and 12 (11.6%) hemorrhagic complications: among the latter, six patients had gastrointestinal bleeding during antiaggregant therapy. No significant correlations were observed between thrombohemorrhagic complications and platelet count, age, sex, platelet function, bleeding time, or therapeutic regimen. However, there was a statistically significant correlation between a positive patient history for thrombotic events and an increase in thromboses. In agreement with other authors, it is believed that the best approach in asymptomatic patients is strict surveillance without treatment. Chemotherapy and/or treatment with antiaggregant agents should be reserved for symptomatic patients or patients with a positive history for thrombotic events.",
      "# Title: Clinical course of essential thrombocythemia in 147 cases.\n# Abstract: The authors retrospectively analyzed the initial characteristics, treatment, and clinical course in 147 patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET). Median age was 60 years and the M:F ratio was 0.69. At diagnosis, 53 patients were asymptomatic; 50 patients had functional symptoms (mainly vasomotor disturbances); 27 patients had large vessel thrombosis; 27 patients had a bleeding diathesis; and seven patients had both bleeding and thrombosis. The platelet count ranged from 0.7 to 2.92 X 10(12)/l. Forty-five of the 61 tested patients (61%) had prolonged bleeding time and/or platelet hypoaggregation. Three patients had in vitro spontaneous aggregation. No significant correlations were found between hemostatic findings and in vivo bleeding or thrombosis. The incidence of bleeding, however, was higher in patients with more than 2 x 10(12)/l platelets. Of 87 karyotypes performed with banding techniques, only four were abnormal. One hundred twenty-nine patients received one or more cytoreductive agents at diagnosis or during follow-up. Sixty patients received an antiaggregating agent. First-line therapy was radiophosphorus (32P) in 22 patients; busulfan in 35 patients; and hydroxyurea in 72 patients. Hydroxyurea required continuous maintenance therapy and had to be changed to another treatment in 12 of the initial responders because of inadequate control of thrombocythemia. During follow-up, 14 treated patients experienced one or several major thrombotic events. Two untreated patients also had major thrombosis. Only one major bleeding event was seen during follow-up. Median actuarial survival was 73.5% at 7 years and only one patient progressed to acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). These results suggest that large vessel thrombosis is the main complication of ET. It appears largely unpredictable in a given patient at diagnosis but can be largely prevented by the control of thrombocythemia. Because of the low incidence of side effects of treatment in this experience, the authors believe that cytoreductive therapy is indicated in most patients with ET, as long as a group of patients with very low risk of thrombosis is not defined in prospective studies.",
      "# Title: Major vascular complications in essential thrombocythemia: a study of the predictive factors in a series of 148 patients.\n# Abstract: To determine the clinicohematological factors predictive for the appearance of major vascular complications (MVC) in patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET), 148 consecutive such patients were retrospectively assessed for the development of MVC during a median follow-up of 58.5 months. Seventy-seven patients had vascular risk factors, and 37 a history of MVC at ET diagnosis. Forty-nine MVC were registered in 33 patients during the follow-up period. The actuarial probability of MVC was 27% at 6 years in the whole series, 35.6% for patients above 60 years, and 21.4% for patients younger than 60 years, whereas only one of the 36 patients younger than 45 years had MVC. At multivariate analysis, age >60 years, history of major ischemia and hypercholesterolemia were the variables associated with an increased MVC risk. These results suggest that all ET patients above 60 years should be treated, whereas in younger patients treatment decisions should be primarily based on the existence of risk factors for MVC.",
      "# Title: Thrombosis and bleeding in myeloproliferative disorders: identification of at-risk patients with whole blood platelet aggregation studies.\n# Abstract: Seventy-five patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders were studied to investigate platelet function by simultaneous measurement of platelet aggregation by the impedance method and ATP dense granule release using a whole blood platelet lumi-aggregometer, in an attempt to identify patients at risk for thrombosis and bleeding. Thirty-nine patients had at least one abnormal result indicating platelet hyperactivity (i.e. impedance or release with one agonist being above the reference range); 16 patients had platelet hypoactivity (i.e. at least one result was below the reference range), whilst 14 had co-existence of hyper- and hypoactivity. Six patients had normal results. 20/53 patients with platelet hyperactivity (alone or mixed) had a positive history of venous and/or arterial thrombosis; in comparison, only two of the other 22 patients had a positive history. During a median follow-up of 33 months, nine patients with and one patient without platelet hyperactivity respectively developed new thrombotic events before the addition of specific therapy. A total of 50 patients with and eight patients without platelet hyperactivity respectively received specific treatment including aspirin and/or cytotoxic therapy. All but one elderly patient with platelet hyperactivity have remained free of new thrombotic events on specific therapy. Two of the 17 patients with platelet hypoactivity had major clinical bleeding. These observations highlight the need to test platelets for hyper- as well as hypo-function and suggest a useful role for routine whole blood platelet aggregation studies to identify the patients at risk for thrombosis or bleeding.",
      "# Title: Incidence, clinical features and outcome of essential thrombocythaemia in a well defined geographical area.\n# Abstract: In an attempt to characterise the clinical features, incidence and outcome of essential thrombocythaemia (ET) we report our experience in a large unselected series of patients from a well defined region. All new cases of ET in the County of Copenhagen were registered during the period 1977-98. We identified 96 cases of ET, yielding an age- and sex-adjusted annual incidence rate of 0.59/100.000 and a point-prevalence at last follow up of 11/100.000. The overall incidence rate was 0.31 and 1.00 per 100.000 population during the consecutive periods 1977-89 and 1990-98, respectively, corresponding to a 3.2-fold increase. Median age at diagnosis was 67 yr (females 68 yr, males 66 yr, range 18-87 yr), and the female to male (F/M) ratio was 2.6:1. At diagnosis, 52% of the patients displayed no ET-related symptoms and were discovered fortuitously by a routine platelet count. Forty-eight percent presented with thrombohaemorrhagic phenomena, of which microvascular disturbances of the central nervous system (CNS), extremities and skin were most frequently observed (23%). Compared to patients diagnosed after 1989, patients diagnosed before 1990 had a significantly higher mean platelet count, white blood cell (WBC) count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) value and alkaline phosphatase value. With a median follow up of 70 months, 5-yr survival was 76%, significantly lower than the expected survival of an age- and sex-matched control group (p = 0.0052). Thirty-seven patients experienced a total of 55 thrombohaemorrhagic events during follow-up, corresponding to an incidence of thrombosis and microvascular disturbances or haemorrhage of 8.1% per pt-yr and 2.5% per pt-yr, respectively. The number of patients experiencing thrombosis or microvascular disturbances was significantly higher among the 29 patients who never received acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) compared to the 67 patients who received ASA during follow up (45% vs. 21%; p = 0.017). This study provides population-based data suggesting the benefit of treatment with low-dose ASA in a non-selected population of patients with ET.",

      "# Title: Frequency and risk factors for thrombosis in idiopathic myelofibrosis: analysis in a series of 155 patients from a single institution.\n# Abstract: Thrombosis is a frequent complication of polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia, but its incidence and predisposing factors in idiopathic myelofibrosis (IM) are unknown. In 18 (11.6%) of 155 patients diagnosed with IM in a single institution, 31 thrombotic events (19 arterial, 12 venous) were registered after a mean follow-up of 4.2 (s.d.: 4.5) years. In six patients, the thrombosis was simultaneous to or appeared a few months before IM diagnosis and 14 had one or more thrombotic episodes. When compared with the general population, a significant increase was observed in the incidence of venous thrombosis (odds ratio 17.5, 95% confidence interval: 10.3-31.4). At multivariate analysis, the initial variables associated with an increased risk of thrombosis were thrombocytosis (platelets >450 x 10(9)/l, P=0.001), presence of one cardiovascular risk factor (arterial hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes, P=0.003), cellular phase of myelofibrosis (P=0.005), and Hb >11 g/dl (P=0.02). Considering post-diagnosis events, the 5-year thrombosis-free survival probability was 90.4% in the series, 80.6% for patients with platelets >450 x 10(9)/l, 82.6% for patients with one cardiovascular risk factor, and 85.1% for those in cellular phase. These results indicate an increased thrombotic risk for IM patients with hyperproliferative features and/or coexistent cardiovascular risk factors.",

      "# Title: Leukocytosis is a risk factor for thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia: interaction with treatment, standard risk factors, and Jak2 mutation status.\n# Abstract: Leukocytes contribute to the pathogenesis of thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia (ET) through recently discovered mechanisms of activation and interaction with platelets and endothelial cells. To evaluate whether an increased leukocyte count was associated with thrombosis and whether this effect can be modulated by therapy, we analyzed the clinical course of 439 patients with ET followed at the Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo. The strength of the association was measured at diagnosis or before thrombotic events by multivariable analyses carried out using data at baseline as well as time-varying covariates. The results showed that (1) an increased leukocyte count at diagnosis was associated with thrombosis during follow-up (\"baseline analysis,\" relative risk [RR] 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-3.9, P = .001); (2) hydroxyurea (HU) lowered leukocytosis and reduced the strength of the association between leukocytosis and thrombosis (\"time-dependent analysis,\" RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.9-2.0, not significant [NS]); (3) the association of leukocytosis and thrombosis was more evident in untreated low-risk patients (RR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-6.4, P = .01) compared with HU-treated high-risk patients (RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.8-3.2, NS); and (4) the presence of JAK2 V617F was not identified as a risk factor for thrombosis during follow-up despite a significant association between the mutation and leukocytosis. We suggest validation of these findings in prospective clinical studies.",
      "# Title: Clinical profile of homozygous JAK2 617V>F mutation in patients with polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia.\n# Abstract: JAK2 617V>F mutation occurs in a homozygous state in 25% to 30% of patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and 2% to 4% with essential thrombocythemia (ET). Whether homozygosity associates with distinct clinical phenotypes is still under debate. This retrospective multicenter study considered 118 JAK2 617V>F homozygous patients (104 PV, 14 ET) whose clinical characteristics were compared with those of 587 heterozygous and 257 wild-type patients. Irrespective of their clinical diagnosis, homozygous patients were older, displayed a higher leukocyte count and hematocrit value at diagnosis, and presented larger spleen volume. Aquagenic pruritus was significantly more common among homozygous PV patients. JAK2 617V>F homozygosity associated with more frequent evolution into secondary myelofibrosis in both PV and ET. After adjustment for sex, age, leukocyte count, and previous thrombosis in a multivariate analysis, homozygous ET patients displayed a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio [HR] 3.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-11.7; P = .013) than wild-type (HR = 1.0) or heterozygous patients (HR = 1.49). No significant association of JAK2 617V>F homozygosity with thrombosis risk was observed in PV. Finally, JAK2 617V>F homozygous patients were more likely to receive chemotherapy for control of disease. We conclude that JAK2 617V>F homozygosity identifies PV or ET patients with a more symptomatic myeloproliferative disorder and is associated with a higher risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with ET.",
      "# Title: Vascular events in Korean patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and their relationship to JAK2 mutation.\n# Abstract: Evaluation of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F mutation has been widely used for the diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). However, its prognostic relevance to clinical outcome is not completely understood. We investigated the association of JAK2 V617F with vascular events in Korean patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). We studied 283 patients from 15 centers, who were diagnosed with MPN. The JAK2 V617F status was evaluated by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. The patients' diagnoses were essential thrombocythemia (ET n = 146), polycythemia vera (PV n = 120), primary myelofibrosis (n = 12), and unclassifiable MPN (MPNu n = 5). JAK2 V617F was detected in 89 (61%) patients with ET, 103 (86%) with PV, four (33%) with myelofibrosis, and four (80%) with MPNu. A higher number of leukocytes, haemoglobin levels and BM cellularity as well as an older age, lower platelet counts, and diagnosis of PV were significantly correlated with JAK2 V617F. Eighty-three and 43 episodes of thrombosis and bleeding occurred in 100 patients each before and after the diagnosis. Vascular events more frequently occurred in 37% of patients with JAK2 V617F than in 29% of those without the mutation (p = 0.045). Among 175 patients whose samples were available for sequencing, 28 patients with homozygous JAK2 V617F had vascular events more frequently (57%) than those who were heterozygotes (39%) or had the wild type (27%) (p = 0.03). The multivariate analysis showed that a JAK2 homozygous mutation, hypercholesterolemia and older age were independent risk factors for a vascular event. The results of this study showed that Korean patients with MPN had a similar JAK2 mutation rate and frequency of vascular events when compared to Western patients. The presence of V617F was significantly related to vascular events. Therefore, initial evaluation for the JAK2 mutation and careful monitoring for vascular events should be performed in MPN patients.",
      "# Title: Thrombosis in primary myelofibrosis: incidence and risk factors.\n# Abstract: We assessed frequency and predictive factors for major cardiovascular (CV) events in 707 patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) followed in 4 European institutions. A total of 236 deaths (33%) were recorded for an overall mortality of 7.7% patient-years (pt-yr). Fatal and nonfatal thromboses were registered in 51 (7.2%) patients, with a rate of 1.75% pt-yr. If deaths from non-CV causes were considered as competing events, we estimated that the adjusted rate of major thrombotic events would have been 2.2% pt-yr. In a multivariable model, age older than 60 years (hazard ratio [HR], 2.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-4.39, P = .01) and JAK2 mutational status (HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.10-3.34; P = .02) were significantly associated with thrombosis, whereas the strength of the association between leukocyte count higher than 15 x 10(9)/L and CV events was of borderline significance (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 0.97-2.72; P = .06). The highest incidence of fatal and nonfatal thrombosis was observed when the mutation was present along with leukocytosis (3.9% pt-yr; HR, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.26-7.81). This study is the largest hitherto carried out in this setting and shows that the rate of major CV events in PMF is comparable with that reported in essential thrombocythemia, and it is increased in aged patients and those with JAK2 V617F mutation and leukocytosis.",
      "# Title: Thrombosis in myelofibrosis: prior thrombosis is the only predictive factor and most venous events are provoked.\n# Abstract: In a retrospective analysis of 205 patients (median age 62 years) with primary myelofibrosis and known JAK2V617F mutational status, 13.2% experienced a vaso-occlusive event at or prior to their diagnosis. After a median follow up of 31 months, post-diagnosis thrombosis occurred in 22 patients (10.7%), including 9 (4.4%) and 16 (7.8%) patients with a total of 9 arterial and 24 venous events, respectively. The majority (71%) of the venous events were temporally associated with other exogenous risk factors for thrombosis such as surgery, line placement or hormonal therapy. On multivariable analysis that included age, JAK2V617F mutation status and leukocyte count as covariates, history of thrombosis was the only predictive variable in general (P=0.04) or when arterial (P=0.007) and venous (P=0.02) thromboses were analyzed separately. The current study demonstrates a higher prevalence of venous, as opposed to arterial, events in PMF, post-diagnosis, and clarifies their nature as being mostly provoked.",
      "# Title: Impact of leukocytosis on thrombotic risk and survival in 532 patients with essential thrombocythemia: a retrospective study.\n# Abstract: Established risk factors for thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia (ET) include age (≥ 60 years) and previous vascular events. Recently, also leukocytosis has been proposed in risk stratification of ET patients. We report a retrospective study on 532 ET patients followed for a median of 7.6 years. Sixty-four patients (12%) developed 95 thrombotic events during follow-up. Together with the high-risk condition, a white blood cell (WBC) value above 11 × 10⁹/L, corresponding to the fourth percentile value, significantly correlated with a higher thrombotic risk (p = 0.033) by Cox proportional hazards. Moreover, the cumulative risk of thrombosis was significantly higher in high-risk patients with WBC >11 × 10⁹/L. JAK2 V617F mutation did not correlate with thrombosis. Overall, 123 (23%) patients died. Three independent parameters were noted as prognostic factors for survival in multivariate analysis: age > 60 years, leukocytosis >11 × 10⁹/L, and hemoglobin level below normal values. Based on these parameters, three groups of risk were defined, with significantly different survivals. Baseline leukocytosis correlated with a higher thrombotic risk in high-risk patients and identified a cohort of patients with worse survival.",
      "# Title: Incidence and risk factors for bleeding in 1104 patients with essential thrombocythemia or prefibrotic myelofibrosis diagnosed according to the 2008 WHO criteria.\n# Abstract: In an international study of 1104 patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET), a histological review according to the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria confirmed ET in 891 patients (WHO-ET, 81%), and revised the diagnosis to prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis (PMF) in 180 patients (PMF, 16%). Major bleeding during follow-up occurred in 55 (6%) WHO-ET and 21 (12%) PMF patients (P = 0.009), at a rate of 0.79 and 1.39% patients per year, respectively, (P = 0.039). In a multivariable analysis, predictors of bleeding included diagnosis of PMF (P = 0.05; hazard ratio (HR) 1.74), leukocytosis (P = 0.04; HR 1.74), previous hemorrhage (P = 0.025; HR 2.35) and aspirin therapy (P=0.001; HR 3.16). The analysis restricted to patients with WHO-ET confirmed previous hemorrhage (P = 0.043; HR 1.92) and aspirin (P=0.027; HR 2.24) as independent risk factors. The current study reveals that major bleeding associated with thrombocytosis might be relatively specific to PMF, as opposed to WHO-defined ET. Furthermore, it shows that low-dose aspirin exacerbates these hemorrhagic events of PMF. In contrast, thrombocytosis per se was not a risk factor for bleeding; however, low-dose aspirin had a synergistic hemorrhagic effect unmasking the bleeding tendency of patients with extreme thrombocytosis. These observations carry significant therapeutic implications in these two WHO entities.",
      "# Title: Leukocytosis as an important risk factor for arterial thrombosis in WHO-defined early/prefibrotic myelofibrosis: an international study of 264 patients.\n# Abstract: We aimed to determine risk factors for thrombotic events in early/prefibrotic myelofibrosis diagnosed according to the World Health Organization criteria. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was calculated on a total number of 264 patients derived from an international database. After a median follow-up of 6.28 years, 42 (15.9%) patients experienced arterial (n = 31) or venous thrombosis (n = 11). A higher leukocyte count correlated with an increased risk for total thrombosis and in particular, with an increased risk for arterial thrombosis (P = 0.005, HR 1.15 and P = 0.047, HR 1.12, respectively). A platelet count above 870 × 10⁹/L was associated with a lower risk for total thrombosis and also for venous thrombosis (P = 0.022, HR 0.44 and P = 0.027, HR 0.19). Moreover, a lower hemoglobin level was associated with an increased risk for venous thrombosis (P = 0.007, HR 0.59).

      "# Title: Thromboses and hemorrhages are common in MPN patients with high JAK2V617F allele burden.\n# Abstract: The most common causes of morbidity and mortality in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications. The JAK2V617F mutation, commonly found in MPN, correlates with several clinical and laboratory characteristics even if the relevance of JAK2V617F allele burden in the natural history of these diseases is unclear. In this study we searched, a relation between thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications and JAK2V617F allele burden level in MPN patients. We evaluated 253 consecutive MPN [121 essential thrombocythemia (ET), 124 polycythemia vera (PV), and 8 primary myelofibrosis (PMF)] patients in whom the JAK2V617F allele burden was available, all studied and followed (median 8.8 years) in our department. Patients were stratified accordingly to their JAK2V617F allele burden, into four quartiles (1st <25%, 2nd 26-50%, 3rd 51-75%, and 4th >75%). Significantly higher incidence of thromboses (p = 0.001) and hemorrhages (p < 0.001) during follow-up has been observed in higher quartiles when compared to lower ones. Thrombosis- and hemorrhage-free survivals were poorer in patients belonging to the highest quartile. Our data suggest that MPN patients with JAK2V617F allele burden higher than 75% have to be considered as high risk patients, being prone to develop thrombo-hemorrhagic complications during the disease course.",
      "# Title: Risk factors for arterial versus venous thrombosis in polycythemia vera: a single center experience in 587 patients.\n# Abstract: In a recent International Working Group on Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) study, prior arterial events and hypertension were predictors of subsequent arterial thrombosis whereas prior venous events and age ≥65 years predicted venous thrombosis in polycythemia vera (PV). In the current study, we sought to validate the above findings and identify additional predictors of arterial versus venous thrombosis. At a median follow up of 109 months, thrombosis after diagnosis occurred in 128 (22%) patients; 82 (14%) arterial and 57 (10%) venous events. On multivariate analysis, prior arterial events (<0.0001), hyperlipidemia (p = 0.03), and hypertension (p = 0.02) predicted subsequent arterial events. In comparison, prior venous events (p = 0.05), leukocytosis ≥11 × 109/L (p = 0.002), and major hemorrhage (p = 0.02) were predictors of subsequent venous events. Salient associations with arterial thrombosis included age ≥ 60 years, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and normal karyotype whereas age ≤ 60 years, females, palpable splenomegaly and history of major hemorrhage were associated with venous thrombosis. TET2 or ASXL1 mutations did not impact arterial nor venous thrombosis. In conclusion, we identify distinct associations for arterial versus venous thrombosis in PV and confirm that a prior arterial or venous thrombotic event is the most reliable predictor of subsequent events.",

Mutations in either the januskinase-2 (JAK-2) or the calreticulin (CALR) gene are characteristic for MPN and may result in enhanced proliferation of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets, and thus increase the risk for vascular events. This study is a retrospective and descriptive analysis of records of patients, who underwent treatment for myeloproliferative syndromes at the Department of Hemato-Oncology of the University hospital Krems from 2008 to the end of 2015. Out of 250 patients, who were suspected for MPN, 51 patients displayed a JAK-2 V617F mutation. These were analyzed with regard to their blood values, gender, age at diagnosis, therapy and vascular events before and after diagnosis (during therapy). Of the 51 patients diagnosed with MPN and a JAK-2 V617F mutation, 33 suffered from PV, 15 from ET and 3 from MF. More men than women were diagnosed with MPN and the median age at diagnosis was 72 years. Acetylsalicylic acid, phlebotomy and Hydroxyurea were the most frequent therapies applied. In our study cohort, the most common vascular events were acute coronary syndrome and transitory ischemic attack. Thromboembolic events were effectively reduced by MPN therapy while no elevation in bleeding events could be observed.",
      "# Title: Clinico-hematological profile and thrombotic/hemorrhagic events in 150 chinese patients with essential thrombocythemia.\n# Abstract: Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is an uncommon chronic myeloproliferative disorder with no cure. Patients with ET are at risk of different complications, and currently there are no optimal prognostic standards to predict severe post-diagnosis complications such as thrombosis and hemorrhage. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the full set of clinical data from 150 Chinese patients with ET enrolled from 2013 to 2016. We discovered that neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), along with other known clinical parameters such as age, leukocyte count, incidence of thrombotic events is higher in patients with JAK2 V617F mutation. NLR is also higher in patients at high-risk stratification of thrombosis. Multivariate analysis showed that age (P = 0.001, 95% CI 1.023-1.089) and JAK2 V617F mutation (P = 0.003, 95% CI 1.837-21.035) were independent factors for thrombotic events, while age (P = 0.005, 95% CI 1.019-1.111) was the only predictive factor for hemorrhagic events at diagnosis. For future thrombotic events, multivariate analysis revealed NLR as the best predictive parameter (P < 0.001, 95% CI 1.173-1.486) when compared with other clinical parameters such as age (P = 0.037, 95% CI 1.004-1.126), thrombosis at diagnosis (P = 0.036, 95% CI 1.077-9.099) and WBC count (P = 0.047, 95% CI 1.001-1.109). Further ROC curve and Kaplan Meier analysis validated NLR as better prognostic marker for future thrombotic events and thrombosis-free survival. In summary, our data suggest that NLR parameter may possess great prognostic significance for future thrombosis in ET patients."

Between January 2010 and June 2015, 132 patients underwent chemotherapy were eligible for assessment. Based on our patients' data, the cut-off value of NLR was 2.78 according to receiver operating characteristic curve.

Increased NLR (ΔNLR > 0) after 2 cycles of chemotherapy was associated with higher risk compared to ΔNLR ≤ 0 (multivariable HR = 1.894, P = 0.007). Combining both NLR and ΔNLR factors, multivariate analysis showed a significant higher risk (HR = 5.817, P < 0.001) for patients with high baseline NLR and increased NLR after 2 cycles of chemotherapy compared to patients with low baseline NLR and ΔNLR ≤ 0.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the determinants and consequences of surveillance completeness. Patients who underwent endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair between October 1996 and August 2004 and enrolled in the EUROSTAR registry were analyzed. Two groups were compared: patients who attended all scheduled visits (group A) and those who came infrequently (group B). Odds ratios and hazard rates (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined to detect which patient characteristics and complications were associated with follow-up intensity. Of the 4,433 patients, 1,538 (35%) attended all scheduled visits until the end of follow-up (group A). Analysis of patient characteristics demonstrated that intensive visitors were more often smokers, hyperlipemic, and considered unfit for open surgery or general anesthesia. Complications during follow-up, including endoleaks (24% vs. 20%), kinking (3.5% vs. 2.5%), and migration (4.9% vs. 3.5%), appeared significantly more frequently in group A. Despite intensive follow-up of this category, still a greater proportion died (12% vs. 9%, adjusted HR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.8). After 84 months of follow-up, the cumulative survival rates in groups A and B were 71% and 74%, respectively (p < 0.0001). It seems that follow-up intensity was based on baseline patient characteristics. High-risk patients had, despite more intensive surveillance, still more complications after adjustment for patient, morphological, and center-specific characteristics.

      "# Title: Genome-wide survey reveals predisposing diabetes type 2-related DNA methylation variations in human peripheral blood.\n# Abstract: Inter-individual DNA methylation variations were frequently hypothesized to alter individual susceptibility to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Sequence-influenced methylations were described in T2DM-associated genomic regions, but evidence for direct, sequence-independent association with disease risk is missing. Here, we explore disease-contributing DNA methylation through a stepwise study design: first, a pool-based, genome-scale screen among 1169 case and control individuals revealed an excess of differentially methylated sites in genomic regions that were previously associated with T2DM through genetic studies. Next, in-depth analyses were performed at selected top-ranking regions. A CpG site in the first intron of the FTO gene showed small (3.35%) but significant (P = 0.000021) hypomethylation of cases relative to controls. The effect was independent of the sequence polymorphism in the region and persists among individuals carrying the sequence-risk alleles. The odds of belonging to the T2DM group increased by 6.1% for every 1% decrease in methylation (OR = 1.061, 95% CI: 1.032-1.090), the odds ratio for decrease of 1 standard deviation of methylation (adjusted to gender) was 1.5856 (95% CI: 1.2824-1.9606) and the sensitivity (area under the curve = 0.638, 95% CI: 0.586-0.690; males = 0.675, females = 0.609) was better than that of the strongest known sequence variant. Furthermore, a prospective study in an independent population cohort revealed significant hypomethylation of young individuals that later progressed to T2DM, relative to the individuals who stayed healthy. Further genomic analysis revealed co-localization with gene enhancers and with binding sites for methylation-sensitive transcriptional regulators. The data showed that low methylation level at the analyzed sites is an early marker of T2DM and suggests a novel mechanism by which early-onset, inter-individual methylation variation at isolated non-promoter genomic sites predisposes to T2DM.",
      "# Title: DNA methylation profiling identifies epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetic patients.\n# Abstract: In addition to genetic predisposition, environmental and lifestyle factors contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Epigenetic changes may provide the link for translating environmental exposures into pathological mechanisms. In this study, we performed the first comprehensive DNA methylation profiling in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We uncovered 276 CpG loci affiliated to promoters of 254 genes displaying significant differential DNA methylation in diabetic islets. These methylation changes were not present in blood cells from T2D individuals nor were they experimentally induced in non-diabetic islets by exposure to high glucose. For a subgroup of the differentially methylated genes, concordant transcriptional changes were present. Functional annotation of the aberrantly methylated genes and RNAi experiments highlighted pathways implicated in β-cell survival and function; some are implicated in cellular dysfunction while others facilitate adaptation to stressors. Together, our findings offer new insights into the intricate mechanisms of T2D pathogenesis, underscore the important involvement of epigenetic dysregulation in diabetic islets and may advance our understanding of T2D aetiology.",

      "# Title: Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of human pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic donors identifies candidate genes that influence insulin secretion.\n# Abstract: Impaired insulin secretion is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Epigenetics may affect disease susceptibility. To describe the human methylome in pancreatic islets and determine the epigenetic basis of T2D, we analyzed DNA methylation of 479,927 CpG sites and the transcriptome in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We provide a detailed map of the global DNA methylation pattern in human islets, β- and α-cells. Genomic regions close to the transcription start site showed low degrees of methylation and regions further away from the transcription start site such as the gene body, 3'UTR and intergenic regions showed a higher degree of methylation. While CpG islands were hypomethylated, the surrounding 2 kb shores showed an intermediate degree of methylation, whereas regions further away (shelves and open sea) were hypermethylated in human islets, β- and α-cells. We identified 1,649 CpG sites and 853 genes, including TCF7L2, FTO and KCNQ1, with differential DNA methylation in T2D islets after correction for multiple testing. The majority of the differentially methylated CpG sites had an intermediate degree of methylation and were underrepresented in CpG islands (∼ 7%) and overrepresented in the open sea (∼ 60%). 102 of the differentially methylated genes, including CDKN1A, PDE7B, SEPT9 and EXOC3L2, were differentially expressed in T2D islets. Methylation of CDKN1A and PDE7B promoters in vitro suppressed their transcriptional activity. Functional analyses demonstrated that identified candidate genes affect pancreatic β- and α-cells as Exoc3l silencing reduced exocytosis and overexpression of Cdkn1a, Pde7b and Sept9 perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion in clonal β- and α-cells, respectively. Together, our data can serve as a reference methylome in human islets. We provide new target genes with altered DNA methylation and expression in human T2D islets that contribute to perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion. These results highlight the importance of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of T2D.",
      "# Title: Altered DNA methylation and differential expression of genes influencing metabolism and inflammation in adipose tissue from subjects with type 2 diabetes.\n# Abstract: Genetics, epigenetics, and environment may together affect the susceptibility for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our aim was to dissect molecular mechanisms underlying T2D using genome-wide expression and DNA methylation data in adipose tissue from monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D and independent case-control cohorts. In adipose tissue from diabetic twins, we found decreased expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation; carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism; and increased expression of genes involved in inflammation and glycan degradation. The most differentially expressed genes included ELOVL6, GYS2, FADS1, SPP1 (OPN), CCL18, and IL1RN. We replicated these results in adipose tissue from an independent case-control cohort. Several candidate genes for obesity and T2D (e.g., IRS1 and VEGFA) were differentially expressed in discordant twins. We found a heritable contribution to the genome-wide DNA methylation variability in twins. Differences in methylation between monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D were subsequently modest. However, 15,627 sites, representing 7,046 genes including PPARG, KCNQ1, TCF7L2, and IRS1, showed differential DNA methylation in adipose tissue from unrelated subjects with T2D compared with control subjects. A total of 1,410 of these sites also showed differential DNA methylation in the twins discordant for T2D. For the differentially methylated sites, the heritability estimate was 0.28. We also identified copy number variants (CNVs) in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D. Taken together, subjects with T2D exhibit multiple transcriptional and epigenetic changes in adipose tissue relevant to the development of the disease.",
      "# Title: An integrated epigenomic analysis for type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci in monozygotic twins.\n# Abstract: DNA methylation has a great potential for understanding the aetiology of common complex traits such as Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here we perform genome-wide methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) in whole-blood-derived DNA from 27 monozygotic twin pairs and follow up results with replication and integrated omics analyses. We identify predominately hypermethylated T2D-related differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and replicate the top signals in 42 unrelated T2D cases and 221 controls. The strongest signal is in the promoter of the MALT1 gene, involved in insulin and glycaemic pathways, and related to taurocholate levels in blood. Integrating the DNA methylome findings with T2D GWAS meta-analysis results reveals a strong enrichment for DMRs in T2D-susceptibility loci. We also detect signals specific to T2D-discordant twins in the GPR61 and PRKCB genes. These replicated T2D associations reflect both likely causal and consequential pathways of the disease. The analysis indicates how an integrated genomics and epigenomics approach, utilizing an MZ twin design, can provide pathogenic insights as well as potential drug targets and biomarkers for T2D and other complex traits.",

      "# Title: Novel epigenetic determinants of type 2 diabetes in Mexican-American families.\n# Abstract: Although DNA methylation is now recognized as an important mediator of complex diseases, the extent to which the genetic basis of such diseases is accounted for by DNA methylation is unknown. In the setting of large, extended families representing a minority, high-risk population of the USA, we aimed to characterize the role of epigenome-wide DNA methylation in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Using Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays, we tested for association of DNA methylation at 446 356 sites with age, sex and phenotypic traits related to T2D in 850 pedigreed Mexican-American individuals. Robust statistical analyses showed that (i) 15% of the methylome is significantly heritable, with a median heritability of 0.14; (ii) DNA methylation at 14% of CpG sites is associated with nearby sequence variants; (iii) 22% and 3% of the autosomal CpG sites are associated with age and sex, respectively; (iv) 53 CpG sites were significantly associated with liability to T2D, fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance; (v) DNA methylation levels at five CpG sites, mapping to three well-characterized genes (TXNIP, ABCG1 and SAMD12) independently explained 7.8% of the heritability of T2D (vi) methylation at these five sites was unlikely to be influenced by neighboring DNA sequence variation. Our study has identified novel epigenetic indicators of T2D risk in Mexican Americans who have increased risk for this disease. These results provide new insights into potential treatment targets of T2D.",

      "# Title: Epigenome-wide association study identifies TXNIP gene associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and sustained hyperglycemia.\n# Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is an established risk factor for a wide range of vascular diseases, including ischemic stroke (IS). Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a marker for average blood glucose levels over the previous 12 weeks, is used as a measure of glycemic control and also as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes (HbA1c levels ≥ 6.5%). Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, may be associated with aging processes and with modulation of the risk of various pathologies, such as DM. Specifically, DNA methylation could be one of the mechanisms mediating the relation between DM and environmental exposures. Our goal was to identify new CpG methylation sites associated with DM. We performed a genome-wide methylation study in whole-blood DNA from an IS patient cohorts. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array was used to measure DNA methylation in CpG sites. All statistical analyses were adjusted for sex, age, hyperlipidemia, body mass index (BMI), smoking habit and cell count. Findings were replicated in two independent cohorts, an IS cohort and a population-based cohort, using the same array. In the discovery phase (N = 355), we identified a CpG site, cg19693031 (located in the TXNIP gene) that was associated with DM (P = 1.17 × 10(-12)); this CpG was replicated in two independent cohorts (N = 167 and N = 645). Methylation of TXNIP was inversely and intensely associated with HbA1c levels (P = 7.3 × 10(-16)), specifically related to diabetic patients with poor control of glucose levels. We identified an association between the TXNIP gene and DM through epigenetic mechanisms, related to sustained hyperglycemia levels (HbA1c ≥ 7%).",

Here we examine whether age-related epigenetic changes affect human islet function and if blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect these changes and associate with future T2D. We analyse DNA methylation genome-wide in islets from 87 non-diabetic donors, aged 26-74 years. Aging associates with increased DNA methylation of 241 sites. These sites cover loci previously associated with T2D, for example, KLF14. Blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related methylation changes in 83 genes identified in human islets (for example, KLF14, FHL2, ZNF518B and FAM123C) and some associate with insulin secretion and T2D. DNA methylation correlates with islet expression of multiple genes, including FHL2, ZNF518B, GNPNAT1 and HLTF. Silencing these genes in β-cells alter insulin secretion. Together, we demonstrate that blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related DNA methylation changes in human islets, and associate with insulin secretion in vivo and T2D.",
      "# Title: Genome-Wide DNA Methylation in Mixed Ancestry Individuals with Diabetes and Prediabetes from South Africa.\n# Abstract: Aims. To conduct a genome-wide DNA methylation in individuals with type 2 diabetes, individuals with prediabetes, and control mixed ancestry individuals from South Africa. Methods. We used peripheral blood to perform genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in 3 individuals with screen detected diabetes, 3 individuals with prediabetes, and 3 individuals with normoglycaemia from the Bellville South Community, Cape Town, South Africa, who were age-, gender-, body mass index-, and duration of residency-matched. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) was performed by Arraystar Inc. (Rockville, MD, USA). Results. Hypermethylated DMRs were 1160 (81.97%) and 124 (43.20%), respectively, in individuals with diabetes and prediabetes when both were compared to subjects with normoglycaemia. Our data shows that genes related to the immune system, signal transduction, glucose transport, and pancreas development have altered DNA methylation in subjects with prediabetes and diabetes. Pathway analysis based on the functional analysis mapping of genes to KEGG pathways suggested that the linoleic acid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism pathways are hypomethylated in prediabetes and diabetes. Conclusions. Our study suggests that epigenetic changes are likely to be an early process that occurs before the onset of overt diabetes. Detailed analysis of DMRs that shows gradual methylation differences from control versus prediabetes to prediabetes versus diabetes in a larger sample size is required to confirm these findings.",
      "# Title: Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing of Human Pancreatic Islets Reveals Novel Differentially Methylated Regions in Type 2 Diabetes Pathogenesis.\n# Abstract: Current knowledge about the role of epigenetics in type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains limited. Only a few studies have investigated DNA methylation of selected candidate genes or a very small fraction of genomic CpG sites in human pancreatic islets, the tissue of primary pathogenic importance for diabetes. Our aim was to characterize the whole-genome DNA methylation landscape in human pancreatic islets, to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in diabetic islets, and to investigate the function of DMRs in islet biology. Here, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, which is a comprehensive and unbiased method to study DNA methylation throughout the genome at a single nucleotide resolution, in pancreatic islets from donors with T2D and control subjects without diabetes. We identified 25,820 DMRs in islets from individuals with T2D. These DMRs cover loci with known islet function, e.g., PDX1, TCF7L2, and ADCY5 Importantly, binding sites previously identified by ChIP-seq for islet-specific transcription factors, enhancer regions, and different histone marks were enriched in the T2D-associated DMRs. We also identified 457 genes, including NR4A3, PARK2, PID1, SLC2A2, and SOCS2, that had both DMRs and significant expression changes in T2D islets. To mimic the situation in T2D islets, candidate genes were overexpressed or silenced in cultured β-cells. This resulted in impaired insulin secretion, thereby connecting differential methylation to islet dysfunction. We further explored the islet methylome and found a strong link between methylation levels and histone marks. Additionally, DNA methylation in different genomic regions and of different transcript types (i.e., protein coding, noncoding, and pseudogenes) was associated with islet expression levels. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the islet DNA methylome in individuals with and without diabetes and highlights the importance of epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets and T2D pathogenesis."

We critically evaluate nursing home quality indicators from the standpoint of theory, measurement, and application, and we recommend strategies to make the indicators more valuable as quality assessment tools. We recommend that (a) more comprehensive quality indicators should be developed in conjunction with the new Minimum Data Set 3.0; (b) the validity and reliability of the indicators should be evaluated thoroughly with respect to both measurement and application; (c) statistical criteria should be incorporated explicitly into quality indicator scoring and outlier targeting; (d) the dimensionality and theoretical structure of the quality indicators should be carefully examined; (e) risk adjustment methods should be refined and broadened; and (f) quality indicator reporting systems should be strengthened and tailored to stakeholders' needs.",

This study analyzes the trend of malnutrition prevalence rates between 2007 and 2011 in the long-term care sector, and the related effects of(1) process indicators such as nutritional screening and treatment and 2) structural indicators (guideline, protocol or nutritional screening policy). From 2007 to 2011, the Dutch National Prevalence Measurement of Care Problems (LPZ) was performed in Dutch long-term care organizations using a standardized questionnaire involving measurements at institutional, ward and resident level. The data were analyzed by mixed-linear regression for longitudinal data. Presence of malnutrition was assessed by BMI, undesired weight loss and nutritional intake. Seventy-four care homes were included (26,101 residents). The malnutrition prevalence trend significantly decreased (P < 0.001) from 26% to 18% from 2007 to 2011. In the final model of the mixed effects analysis only the interacted process indicators nutritional screening and oral nutritional supplementation (ONS) were significant in influencing malnutrition prevalence rates over time. Structural indicators had no impact on the malnutrition prevalence over time. In conclusion, over time a lower prevalence of malnutrition is associated with a higher degree of nutritional screening. As might be expected, a higher prevalence of malnutrition is associated with higher use of ONS. Structural nutritional screening is an important intervention to tackle the problem of malnutrition in the long term care sector.",

An international comparison of The Netherlands, Germany and Austria.\n# Abstract: Prevalence rates of malnutrition vary considerably internationally, partly due to differences in measurement methodology and instruments. In the present study, the same measurement methodology and instruments were used in The Netherlands, Germany and Austria. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether resident characteristics influence possible differences in malnutrition prevalence between countries. The study followed a cross-sectional, multi-centre design that measured malnutrition in nursing home residents from The Netherlands, Germany and Austria. Resident data were gathered using a standardised questionnaire. Malnutrition was operationalised using BMI, unintentional weight loss and nutritional intake. Data were analysed using an association model. The prevalence rates of malnutrition in The Netherlands, Germany and Austria were 18·3, 20·1 and 22·5 %, respectively. The multivariate generalised estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression analysis showed that sex, age, care dependency, the mean number of diseases and some specific diseases were influencing factors for whether the resident was malnourished or not. The OR of malnutrition in the three countries declined after including the influencing factors resulting from the multivariate GEE analysis. The present study reveals that differences in the prevalence rates of malnutrition in nursing homes in The Netherlands, Germany and Austria are influenced by different resident characteristics. Since other country-related factors could also play an important role in influencing differences in the prevalence rates of malnutrition between the countries (structural and process factors of malnutrition care policy).

The objective of our study was to evaluate the prognostic role of baseline NLR and change in NLR (ΔNLR) in advanced pancreatic cancer underwent chemotherapy. Between January 2010 and June 2015, 132 patients underwent chemotherapy were eligible for assessment. Based on our patients' data, the cut-off value of NLR was 2.78 according to receiver operating characteristic curve. We observed that a high level of baseline NLR (NLR > 2.78) was a poor prognostic factor for overall survival (multivariable hazard ratio [HR] = 2.648, P < 0.001). Increased NLR (ΔNLR > 0) after 2 cycles of chemotherapy was associated with higher risk compared to ΔNLR ≤ 0 (multivariable HR = 1.894, P = 0.007). Combining both NLR and ΔNLR factors, multivariate analysis showed a significant higher risk (HR = 5.817, P < 0.001) for patients with high baseline NLR and increased NLR after 2 cycles of chemotherapy compared to patients with low baseline NLR and ΔNLR ≤ 0.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 49 patients with type 2 diabetes who underwent radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer in the Department of gastroenterology of the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University from Jan to Dec 2020. They were randomly divided into experimental group and control group according to different perioperative management measures. The perioperative C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell (WBC), interleukin-6(IL-6), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), blood glucose fluctuation and postoperative recovery were compared between the two groups. Results: A total of 49 patients were enrolled in the study (23 in the experimental group and 26 in the control group). The degree of stress reaction of the experimental group was lighter than that of the control group. The levels of CRP were significantly different on the 5th and 7th day after operation, IL-6 was significantly different on the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th day after operation, WBC and HOMA-IR were significantly different on the 1st day postoperatively. And the changes of HOMA-IR and blood glucose in experimental group were more gentle than those in control group. All the differences were statistically significant(P<0.05).

A total of 80 patients with acute cerebral infarction who were treated at our hospital were randomly selected. They were divided into groups A and B. The two groups were treated with intravenous thrombolysis, while group B received sub-hypothermia treatment. Prior to treatment and at 7 days after treatment, 5 ml of venous blood was collected and stored in a freezer at -80˚C. IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 levels were detected by ELISA and compared between the groups and time-points. The results were as follows: i) At 7 days after treatment, the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in group B were significantly decreased compared with those in group A (P<0.05), while there was no significant difference of these levels between group A and B before treatment (P>0.05).

PD and healthy control (HC) participants received a dual-stimuli attention task. The results were assessed using principal component analysis to quantify and rank attention capability. Accordingly, 22 PD and 42 HC subjects were equally divided into poorer (14 PD-P, 18 HC-P) and better (8 PD-B, 24 HC-B) attention capabilities. To analyze the spatiotemporal gait parameters, each participant walked forwards and backwards on a GAITRite(®) walkway. Compared to HC, PD performed worse in the dual task and exhibited slower velocity, less swing, and shorter stride in both walking directions. Notably, PD-P experienced all these gait defects, regardless of directions. PD-B walked worse than HC-B backwards, and displayed comparable gait to HC-P in both directions. In PD and HC, velocity, stride, and swing decreased perceptibly when walking backwards compared to forwards, and the same was true for velocity and stride in PD-P and PD-B. Backward strides were reduced evidently more in PD-P than in PD-B. However, backward swing reductions in PD-P and PD-B were statistically insignificant. Cadence in both directions was similar within the groups and between the groups, and there were little alterations between directions within each group and between groups. These results suggest that attention capability may affect PD gait. Poorer attention exacerbates gait defects and better attention improves gait in both directions. These results may support the application of cuing strategies in PD to enhance attention capability and improve walking gait.",
      "# Title: Investigation of factors impacting mobility and gait in Parkinson disease.\n# Abstract: Mobility and gait limitations are major issues for people with Parkinson disease (PD). Identification of factors that contribute to these impairments may inform treatment and intervention strategies. In this study we investigated factors that predict mobility and gait impairment in PD. Participants with mild to moderate PD and without dementia (n=114) were tested in one session 'off' medication. Mobility measures included the 6-Minute Walk test and Timed-Up-and-Go. Gait velocity was collected in four conditions: forward preferred speed, forward dual task, forward fast as possible and backward walking. The predictors analyzed were age, gender, disease severity, balance, balance confidence, fall history, self-reported physical activity, and executive function. Multiple regression models were used to assess the relationships between predictors and outcomes. The predictors, in different combinations for each outcome measure, explained 55.7% to 66.9% of variability for mobility and 39.5% to 52.8% for gait velocity. Balance was the most relevant factor (explaining up to 54.1% of variance in mobility and up to 45.6% in gait velocity). Balance confidence contributed to a lesser extent (2.0% to 8.2% of variance) in all models. Age explained a small percentage of variance in mobility and gait velocity (up to 2.9%). Executive function explained 3.0% of variance during forward walking only. The strong predictive relationships between balance deficits and mobility and gait impairment suggest targeting balance deficits may be particularly important for improving mobility and gait in people with PD, regardless of an individual's age, disease severity, fall history, or other demographic features."

However, BI-ALCL diagnosis on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) might be challenging for pathologists lacking experience with peri-implant breast effusions. Sixty-seven late breast implant seromas collected by FNA from 50 patients were evaluated by Papanicolaou smear stain and immunocytochemistry on cell blocks. A diagnostic algorithm based on the cellular composition, cell morphology and percentage of CD30+ cells was developed. Histological evaluation of the corresponding peri-prosthetic capsules was also performed. Most of the effusions (91% of the samples) were classified as reactive and 9% as BI-ALCL. In the BI-ALCL cases, medium-to-large atypical cells expressing CD30 represented more than 70% of the cellularity, whereas in in the reactive effusions CD30+ elements were extremely rare (<5%) and consisted of non-atypical elements. The reactive effusions were categorized into three patterns: i) acute infiltrate with prominent neutrophilic component (33% of the samples); ii) mixed infiltrate characterized by a variable number of neutrophils, lymphocytes and macrophages (30% of the samples); iii) chronic infiltrate composed predominantly of T lymphocytes or macrophages with only sporadic granulocytes (37% of the samples). The inflammatory cytological patterns were consistent with the histology of the corresponding capsules. Our results indicate that cytological analysis of late breast implant effusions, supported by the knowledge of the heterogeneous cytomorphological spectrum of late seromas, is a valuable approach for the early recognition of BI-ALCL.",

Its etiology unknown, one hypothesis suggests an initiating inflammatory stimulus, possibly infectious, triggers BIA-ALCL. We analyzed microbiota of breast, skin, implant and capsule in BIA-ALCL patients (n = 7), and controls via culturing methods, 16S rRNA microbiome sequencing, and immunohistochemistry. Alpha and beta diversity metrics and relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria were calculated, and phylogenetic trees constructed. Staphylococcus spp., the most commonly cultured microbes, were identified in both the BIA-ALCL and contralateral control breast. The diversity of bacterial microbiota did not differ significantly between BIA-ALCL and controls for any material analyzed. Further, there were no significant differences in the relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria between BIA-ALCL and control specimens. Heat maps suggested substantial diversity in the composition of the bacterial microbiota of the skin, breast, implant and capsule between patients with no clear trend to distinguish BIA-ALCL from controls.

We investigated whether bacteria could trigger the activation and multiplication of BIA-ALCL cells in vitro. BIA-ALCL patient-derived BIA-ALCL tumor cells, BIA-ALCL cell lines, cutaneous ALCL cell lines, an immortal T-cell line (MT-4), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from BIA-ALCL, capsular contracture, and primary augmentation patients were studied. Cells were subjected to various mitogenic stimulation assays including plant phytohemagglutinin (PHA), Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Staphylococcal superantigens enterotoxin A (SEA), toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), or sterilized implant shells. Patient-derived BIA-ALCL tumor cells and BIA-ALCL cell lines showed a unique response to LPS stimulation. This response was dampened significantly in the presence of a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) inhibitor peptide. In contrast, cutaneous ALCL cells, MT-4, and PBMC cells from all patients responded significantly more to PHA, SEA, and TSST-1 than to LPS. Breast implant shells of all surface grades alone did not produce a proliferative response of BIA-ALCL cells, indicating the breast implant does not act as a pro-inflammatory stimulant. These findings indicate a possible novel pathway for LPS to promote BIA-ALCL cell proliferation via a TLR4 receptor-mediated bacterial transformation of T-cells into malignancy."

A randomized, single-blind study was performed to evaluate the effects of the combination of high-dose furosemide and small-volume hypertonic saline solution (HSS) infusion in the treatment of refractory New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV CHF and a normosodic diet during follow-up. Materials and Methods One hundred seven patients (39 women and 68 men, age range 65-90 years) with refractory CHF (NYHA class IV) of different etiologies, who were unresponsive to high oral doses of furosemide, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digitalis, and nitrates, were enrolled. Inclusion criteria included an ejection fraction (EF) <35%, serum creatinine level <2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level < or =60 mg/dL, reduced urinary volume, and low natriuresis. The patients were randomized in 2 groups (single-blind). Patients in group 1 (20 women and 33 men) received an intravenous (IV) infusion of furosemide (500-1000 mg) plus HSS (150 mL of 1.4%-4.6% NACl) twice a day in 30 minutes. Patients in group 2 (19 women and 35 men) received an IV bolus of furosemide (500-1000 mg) twice a day, without HSS, during a period lasting 6 to 12 days. Both groups received IV KCl (20-40 mEq) to prevent hypokalemia. At study entry, all patients underwent a physical examination and measurement of body weight (BW), blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR), an evaluation of signs of CHF, and measurement of control levels of serum Na, K, Cl, bicarbonate, albumin, uric acid, creatinine, urea, and glycemia daily during hospitalization, and measurements of the daily output of urine for Na, K, and Cl. A chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram were obtained at study entry, during hospitalization, and at the time of discharge from the hospital. During the treatment and after discharge, the daily dietary Na intake was 120 mmol in group 1 versus 80 mmol in group 2, with a fluid intake of 1000 mL daily in both groups. An assessment of BW and 24-hour urinary volume, serum, and urinary laboratory parameters were performed daily until patients reached a compensated state, when IV furosemide was replaced with oral administration (250-500 mg/d).

Both groups had normal sodium (120 mmol sodium) intake. After discharge, the two groups continued to receive 120 mmol Na/day and 500-1000 mL water/day.The first group (132 C-HSS patients) had an increase in urination, a reduction in hospitalization time (4 ± 2 versus 7 ± 2 days, P < 0.01), and a reduction in hospitalization costs (2210 RMB versus 3506 RMB, P < 0.01) compared with the second group (132 without C-HSS patients). During the follow-up period (36 ± 12 months), the first group had a significantly higher average readmission time (31.84 ± 7.58 months versus 15.60 ± 6.25 months, P < 0.01) and lower mortality rate (16.5% versus 31.9%, P < 0.01).The results suggest that periodical C-HSS administration, combined with serious water restriction and a normal sodium diet, significantly reduces the hospitalization time, readmission rate, and mortality in patients with NYHA class III HF."

      "# Title: Comparisons of forward and backward gait between poorer and better attention capabilities in early Parkinson's disease.\n# Abstract: This study compared forward and backward gait between Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with poorer and better attention capabilities. PD and healthy control (HC) participants received a dual-stimuli attention task. The results were assessed using principal component analysis to quantify and rank attention capability. Accordingly, 22 PD and 42 HC subjects were equally divided into poorer (14 PD-P, 18 HC-P) and better (8 PD-B, 24 HC-B) attention capabilities. To analyze the spatiotemporal gait parameters, each participant walked forwards and backwards on a GAITRite(®) walkway. Compared to HC, PD performed worse in the dual task and exhibited slower velocity, less swing, and shorter stride in both walking directions. Notably, PD-P experienced all these gait defects, regardless of directions. PD-B walked worse than HC-B backwards, and displayed comparable gait to HC-P in both directions. In PD and HC, velocity, stride, and swing decreased perceptibly when walking backwards compared to forwards, and the same was true for velocity and stride in PD-P and PD-B. Backward strides were reduced evidently more in PD-P than in PD-B. However, backward swing reductions in PD-P and PD-B were statistically insignificant. Cadence in both directions was similar within the groups and between the groups, and there were little alterations between directions within each group and between groups. These results suggest that attention capability may affect PD gait. Poorer attention exacerbates gait defects and better attention improves gait in both directions. These results may support the application of cuing strategies in PD to enhance attention capability and improve walking gait.",
      "# Title: Investigation of factors impacting mobility and gait in Parkinson disease.\n# Abstract: Mobility and gait limitations are major issues for people with Parkinson disease (PD). Identification of factors that contribute to these impairments may inform treatment and intervention strategies. In this study we investigated factors that predict mobility and gait impairment in PD. Participants with mild to moderate PD and without dementia (n=114) were tested in one session 'off' medication. Mobility measures included the 6-Minute Walk test and Timed-Up-and-Go. Gait velocity was collected in four conditions: forward preferred speed, forward dual task, forward fast as possible and backward walking. The predictors analyzed were age, gender, disease severity, balance, balance confidence, fall history, self-reported physical activity, and executive function. Multiple regression models were used to assess the relationships between predictors and outcomes. The predictors, in different combinations for each outcome measure, explained 55.7% to 66.9% of variability for mobility and 39.5% to 52.8% for gait velocity. Balance was the most relevant factor (explaining up to 54.1% of variance in mobility and up to 45.6% in gait velocity). Balance confidence contributed to a lesser extent (2.0% to 8.2% of variance) in all models. Age explained a small percentage of variance in mobility and gait velocity (up to 2.9%). Executive function explained 3.0% of variance during forward walking only. The strong predictive relationships between balance deficits and mobility and gait impairment suggest targeting balance deficits may be particularly important for improving mobility and gait in people with PD, regardless of an individual's age, disease severity, fall history, or other demographic features."

      "# Title: Safety, feasibility, and potential efficacy of intraarterial selective cooling infusion for stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy.\n# Abstract: This is a prospective non-randomized cohort study of 113 consecutive patients to investigate the safety and efficacy of a short-duration intraarterial selective cooling infusion (IA-SCI) targeted into an ischemic territory combined with mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in patients with large vessel occlusion-induced acute ischemic stroke (AIS); 45/113 patients underwent IA-SCI with 350 ml 0.9% saline at 4℃ for 15 min at the discretion of the interventionalist. Key parameters such as vital signs and key laboratory values, symptomatic and any intracranial hemorrhage, coagulation abnormalities, pneumonia, urinary tract infections and mortality were not significantly different between the two groups. Final infarct volume (FIV) was assessed on noncontrast CT performed at three to seven days. After an adjusted regression analysis, the between-group difference in FIV (19.1 ml; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.2 to 25.2; P = 0.038) significantly favored the IA-SCI group. At 90 days, no differences were found in the proportion of patients who achieved functional independence (mRS 0-2) (51.1% versus. 41.2%, adjusted odd ratio (aOR) 1.9, 95% CI 0.8-2.6, P = 0.192). Combining short-duration IA-SCI with MT was safe. There was a smaller FIV and trend towards clinical benefit that will need to be further evaluated in randomized control trials.",

      "# Title: Effect of intravenous thrombolysis combined with mild hypothermia on the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in patients with acute cerebral infarction and clinical significance.\n# Abstract: The present study aimed to explore the effects and clinical importance of serum interleukin (IL) IL-1β, IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 in patients with acute cerebral infarction undergoing intravenous thrombolysis during simultaneous hypothermia therapy. A total of 80 patients with acute cerebral infarction who were treated at our hospital were randomly selected. They were divided into groups A and B. The two groups were treated with intravenous thrombolysis, while group B received sub-hypothermia treatment. Prior to treatment and at 7 days after treatment, 5 ml of venous blood was collected and stored in a freezer at -80˚C. IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 levels were detected by ELISA and compared between the groups and time-points. The results were as follows: i) At 7 days after treatment, the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in group B were significantly decreased compared with those in group A (P<0.05), while there was no significant difference of these levels between group A and B before treatment (P>0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions in group A and group B was 35 and 20% respectively, and the mortality rate was 10 and 5%, respectively. There were no significant differences in adverse events and mortality between the two groups (P>0.05). In addition, a positive correlation of the level of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was determined in the patients prior to treatment. In conclusion, mild hypothermia treatment in addition to intravenous thrombolysis significantly reduced the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in patients with acute cerebral infarction and reduced inflammation, and should therefore be incorporated in clinical practice.",

    "referenceConclusion": "Pre-conditioning significantly reduced the severity of creatine kinase release, delayed-onset muscle soreness, loss of maximal voluntary contraction force and the range of motion decrease. Pre-conditioning may prevent severe EIMD and accelerate recovery of muscle force generation capacity. The current systematic review identified that pre-conditioning activities are effective in attenuating EIMD measures, CK, muscle soreness, ROM and maximal voluntary force production. These findings suggest the use of pre-conditioning activities prior to a strenuous bout of exercise does provide a significant protective effect when performed a minimum of 24 h prior to the damaging stimulus. Furthermore, the greater improvement in MVC suggests that the pre-conditioning activities may accelerate the recovery of muscle contractile properties following strenuous exercises. However, it is unclear if pre-conditioning would prevent EIMD from more complex exercises or to what extent EIMD prevention carries over into other modes of exercise.",

      "# Title: Muscle tenderness and peak torque changes after downhill running following a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: Unaccustomed exercise (usually of an eccentric nature) is often followed by delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Previous studies have found that prior eccentric activity produces a training effect which reduces DOMS and morphological changes. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a prior bout of maximal isokinetic eccentric exercise on DOMS, strength loss and plasma creatine kinase (CK) changes following a downhill run. Ten male subjects with a mean (+/- S.D.) age of 22.5 +/- 2.8 years, body mass of 62.67 +/- 0.05 kg and height of 176 +/- 3 cm were allocated to either a treatment group or a control group. The treatment group performed 100 maximal eccentric activations of the knee extensors in the dominant leg at 0.52 rad s-1. Two weeks later, the downhill run was performed on a motor-driven treadmill. This consisted of five bouts of 8 min at a gradient of -10% at a speed corresponding to 80% of the predicted maximal heart rate. The untrained group performed the downhill run as above but without the prior isokinetic session. Tenderness measurements, plasma CK activity and concentric and eccentric isokinetic peak torque measurements of the knee extensors at 0.52 and 2.83 rad s-1 were recorded prior to, immediately following and 2, 4 and 7 days after each protocol. The isokinetic protocol caused an increase (P < 0.01) in CK and tenderness and a decrease (P < 0.05) in concentric and eccentric torque at both speeds in the treatment group. Following the downhill run, a reduction in peak torque (P < 0.01) was observed in the eccentric and concentric modes at both isokinetic speeds in the control group. For the treatment group, the decrease in peak torque occurred only at the faster eccentric speed. With the exception of the faster eccentric speed, the decrement in peak torque was greater in the control group in all post-exercise isokinetic strength tests. There was less tenderness (P < 0.01) in the trained knee extensor muscle group. Peak torque also returned to pre-downhill values earlier for the trained group. Although plasma CK activity increased in both groups after downhill running, it was much lower (P < 0.01) in the trained group. The results suggest that a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric training reduces muscle damage, reduces the amount of strength loss and decreases the sensation of DOMS after downhill running.",
      "# Title: Exercise-induced skeletal muscle damage and adaptation following repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions.\n# Abstract: Repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions were used to examine indirect indices of exercise-induced muscle damage and adaptation in human skeletal muscle. Twenty-four subjects (18 females, 6 males) aged 20.0 +/- 1.4 years (mean +/- S.D.) performed an initial bout of either 10 (n = 7), 30 (n = 9) or 50 (n = 8) maximum voluntary eccentric contractions of the knee extensors, followed by a second bout of 50 contractions 3 weeks later using the same leg. Muscle soreness was elevated after all bouts (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon test), although the initial bout reduced the soreness associated with the second bout. Force loss and a decline in the 20:100 Hz percutaneous electrical myostimulation force ratio were observed after all exercise bouts (P < 0.01). Serum creatine kinase activity was elevated following the initial bouts of 30 and 50 repetitions (P < 0.01), but there was no increase following 10 repetitions. No increase in serum creatine kinase activity was observed in any group following the second bout of contractions (P > 0.05). We conclude that skeletal muscle adaptation can be brought about by a single bout of relatively few eccentric muscle contractions. Increasing the number of eccentric muscle repetitions did not result in an increased prophylactic effect on skeletal muscle.",
      "# Title: Influence of previous concentric exercise on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether a fatiguing concentric exercise performed immediately before eccentric exercise would exacerbate eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. One arm of nine female subjects (mean +/- s: 23.3 +/- 6.7 years) performed 12 maximal eccentric actions of the elbow flexors (ECC), and the other arm performed 100 repetitions of isokinetic concentric actions of the elbow flexors followed by the same eccentric exercise (CON-ECC). The two exercise regimens (ECC and CON-ECC) were separated by 2 weeks and presented in a counterbalanced order. Changes in muscle soreness level, maximal isometric force generation, relaxed and flexed elbow joint angle, upper arm circumference and plasma creatine kinase activity were compared between the ECC and CON-ECC conditions. All measures changed significantly after both ECC and CON-ECC; however, there were significant differences in the changes between the conditions. A lower level of soreness, a faster recovery of maximal isometric force generation, a smaller decrease in relaxed elbow joint angle and a smaller increase in upper arm circumference and creatine kinase activity were evident after the CON-ECC condition compared to the ECC condition. Thus, it would seem that muscle damage was attenuated by performance of previous concentric exercise. An additional experiment using a different group of subjects (n = 5) showed that warm-up exercise before the eccentric exercise also attenuated eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Acute adaptation to low volume eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: Many symptoms of eccentric muscle damage can be substantially reduced if a similar eccentric bout is repeated within several weeks of the initial bout. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a nondamaging, low repetition, low volume eccentric exercise bout could also provide a protective/adaptive effect.",
      "# Title: The repeated bout effect of reduced-load eccentric exercise on elbow flexor muscle damage.\n# Abstract: In this study we investigated the extent to which an initial eccentric exercise consisting of two (2ECC) or six maximal eccentric actions (6ECC) of the elbow flexors would produce a similar effect to 24 maximal eccentric actions (24ECC), on a second bout of 24ECC performed 2 weeks later. Male students (n = 34) were assigned to one of three groups, and with their non-dominant arm performed either 2ECC (n = 12), 6ECC (n = 10), or 24ECC (n = 12) as a first bout of exercise. Two weeks later all groups performed 24ECC. Maximal isometric strength, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration were assessed before, immediately after, and for 4 days after exercise. Changes in all variables were compared between the bouts and groups by a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance. All variables changed significantly (P< 0.05) after 2ECC, 6ECC, and 24ECC, but the amount of change after 2ECC and 6ECC was significantly smaller (P<0.05) than both 6ECC and 24ECC, and 24ECC, respectively. After the second bout, the 6ECC and 24ECC groups showed a profound repeated bout effect, and no significant differences were found between the groups. All variables except muscle soreness were significantly (P< 0.05) larger after the second bout for the 2ECC group, however the changes observed after 24ECC were significantly smaller (P < 0.01) than those observed after the first 24ECC of the 24ECC group. These results suggest that it is not necessary to conduct a high number of eccentric actions in the first bout to elicit a repeated bout effect in a subsequent bout performed some time later.",

      "# Title: Intensity of eccentric exercise, shift of optimum angle, and the magnitude of repeated-bout effect.\n# Abstract: This study compared the effect of four different intensities of initial eccentric exercise (ECC1) on optimum angle shift and extent of muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise. Fifty-two male students were placed into 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% groups (n = 13 per group), performing 30 eccentric actions of the elbow flexors of 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% of maximal isometric strength [maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)] for ECC1, followed 2-3 wk later by a similar exercise (ECC2) that used 100% MVC load. MVC at six elbow joint angles, range of motion, upper arm circumference, serum creatine kinase activity, myoglobin concentration, and muscle soreness were measured before and for 5 days following ECC1 and ECC2. A rightward shift of optimum angle following ECC1 was significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 100% and 80% than for the 60% and 40% groups, and it decreased significantly (P < 0.05) from immediately to 5 days postexercise. By the time ECC2 was performed, only the 100% group kept a significant shift (4 degrees). Changes in most of the criterion measures following ECC1 were significantly greater for the 100% and 80% groups compared with the 60% and 40% groups. Changes in the criterion measures following ECC2 were significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 40% group compared with other groups. Although the magnitude of repeated bout effect following ECC2 was significantly (P < 0.05) smaller for the 40% and 60% groups, all groups showed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced changes in criterion measures following ECC2 compared with the ECC1 100% bout. We conclude that the repeated-bout effect was not dependent on the shift of optimum angle.",
      "# Title: Repeated bout effect after maximal eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: We hypothesized that a bout of high or low volume eccentric exercise would protect against muscle damage following a subsequent high volume bout and that adaptation would be attributable to neural changes, independent of the initial exercise volume. Sixteen males performed either 45 (ECC45) or 10 (ECC10) maximal eccentric contractions using the elbow flexors, followed by an ECC45 bout 2 weeks later. Damage markers were measured for the following 96 h; EMG and work done during the first 10 eccentric contractions were also recorded. CK, soreness, and decrements in MVC and range of motion (ROM) were greater in bout 1 than bout 2 (p < 0.01). Soreness, MVC and ROM were greater after the initial ECC45 bout compared to the initial ECC10 bout and the repeated bouts of ECC45 exercise in both groups (p < 0.01). Median frequency decreased from bout 1 to bout 2 (p < 0.001), no differences between groups were observed. An ECC45 bout of maximal eccentric exercise causes more initial damage than an ECC10 bout of maximal eccentric exercise, although both confer protection from subsequent ECC45 bouts of maximal eccentric contractions, which are attributable, at least in part, to a shift in the frequency content of EMG.",
      "# Title: A light load eccentric exercise confers protection against a subsequent bout of more demanding eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that a light eccentric exercise (ECC) that does not induce a loss of muscle function and delayed onset muscle soreness would confer a protective effect against a more strenuous ECC. Eighteen young men were randomly placed into two groups: 10-40% (n=9) and 40% (n=9). Subjects in the 10-40% group performed ECC of the elbow flexors (six sets of five reps) using a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (MVC) at an elbow joint angle of 90 degrees , followed 2 days later by ECC using a dumbbell weight of 40% MVC. Subjects in the 40% group performed the 40% ECC only. Changes in MVC, range of motion (ROM), upper arm circumference (CIR), plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and muscle soreness before, immediately after, 1-5 and 7 days following the 40% ECC were compared between groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any of the criterion measures were found immediately and 1-2 days after the 10% ECC. Following the 40% ECC, the 10-40% group showed significantly (P<0.05) smaller decreases in MVC and ROM, and smaller increases in muscle soreness compared with the 40% group, but no significant differences between groups were evident for CIR and plasma CK activity. These results suggest that the 10% ECC induced some protection against a subsequent bout of 40% ECC performed 2 days later. It appears that the light eccentric exercise preconditioned the muscles for exposure to the subsequent damaging eccentric exercise bout.",
      "# Title: Protection against muscle damage following fifty drop jumps conferred by ten drop jumps.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether 10 drop jumps (DJs) would confer protective effect against muscle damage and soreness in a subsequent bout of 50 DJs. Sixteen men were randomly placed into either a group performing 1 set of 10 DJs followed by 5 sets of 10 DJs (10-50, n = 8) or another group performing 2 bouts of 5 sets of 10 DJs (50-50, n = 8) separated by 2 weeks. The DJs were performed from a box height of 0.6 m, with a 10-second interval between jumps and a 1-minute rest between sets. Jump height, peak vertical ground reaction force, ground contact time, and heart rate during DJs were measured, and blood lactate concentration was assessed before and immediately after DJs. Changes in maximal isometric (ISO) and isokinetic concentric torque (CON), vertical jump, muscle soreness, and plasma creatine kinase activity before, immediately after, and at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours following exercise were compared between groups for the first and second bouts and between the bouts by a 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance. Changes in ISO, CON, vertical jump, and muscle soreness were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller for 10 DJs compared with 50 DJs; however, no significant differences in the measures between groups were evident following the second bout. The changes in the measures following 50 DJs in the 10-50 group were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller than those following the first bout of the 50-50 group. These results suggest that 10 DJs and 50 DJs conferred the same magnitude of protective effect against muscle damage by 50 DJs.",
      "# Title: Muscle damage protection by low-intensity eccentric contractions remains for 2 weeks but not 3 weeks.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that the protective effect conferred by a low-intensity eccentric exercise against maximal eccentric exercise would not last more than a week. Untrained men (21.3 ± 1.6 years) were allocated into either a control or one of four repeated bout groups (n = 13 per group). The repeated bout groups performed 30 low-intensity eccentric contractions (ECC) of the elbow flexors with a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (10%-ECC) either 2 days, 7 days (1 week), 14 days (2 weeks) or 21 days (3 weeks) before 30 maximal eccentric contractions (Max-ECC). The control group performed Max-ECC only. Changes in maximal voluntary contraction strength, optimum angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following 10%-ECC were analysed by a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Changes in the variables following Max-ECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. The 10%-ECC did not change any variables, showing no indication of muscle damage. The changes in all variables following Max-ECC were smaller (P < 0.05) for 2-day, 1- and 2-week groups than control group, without significant differences between 2-day and 1-week groups. The 2-week group showed greater (P < 0.05) changes in all variables compared with 2-day and 1-week groups. Changes in the variables were similar between 3-week and control groups, except for muscle soreness showing smaller (P < 0.05) changes for 3-week group. These results suggest that non-damaging eccentric exercise confers a protective effect against Max-Ecc, but the effect is attenuated between 1 and 2 weeks.",
      "# Title: Two maximal isometric contractions attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVC-ISO) would attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. Young untrained men were placed into one of the two experimental groups or one control group (n = 13 per group). Subjects in the experimental groups performed either two or 10 MVC-ISO of the elbow flexors at a long muscle length (20° flexion) 2 days prior to 30 maximal isokinetic eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors. Subjects in the control group performed the eccentric contractions without MVC-ISO. No significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction peak torque, peak torque angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and myoglobin concentration, muscle soreness, and ultrasound echo intensity were evident after MVC-ISO. Changes in the variables following eccentric contractions were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2 MVC-ISO group (e.g., peak torque loss at 5 days after exercise, 23% ± 3%; peak CK activity, 1964 ± 452 IU·L(-1); peak muscle soreness, 46 ± 4 mm) or the 10 MVC-ISO group (13% ± 3%, 877 ± 198 IU·L(-1), 30 ± 4 mm) compared with the control (34% ± 4%, 6192 ± 1747 IU·L(-1), 66 ± 5 mm). The 10 MVC-ISO group showed smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following eccentric contractions compared with the 2 MVC-ISO group. Therefore, two MVC-ISO conferred potent protective effects against muscle damage, whereas greater protective effect was induced by 10 MVC-ISO, which can be used as a strategy to minimize muscle damage.",

      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions attenuate muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise of the knee extensors in the elderly.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors would attenuate the magnitude of muscle damage induced by maximal eccentric exercise of the same muscle performed 7 days later using elderly individuals. Healthy older men (66.4 ± 4.6 years) were assigned to control or experimental (Exp) group (n = 13 per group). The control group performed six sets of ten maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC) of the knee extensors of non-dominant leg. The Exp group performed six sets of ten low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors on a leg extension machine by lowering a weight of 10 % maximal voluntary isometric knee extension strength (10 %ECC) 7 days prior to MaxECC. Changes in maximal voluntary isokinetic concentric torque (MVC-CON), angle at peak torque, range of motion (ROM), upper thigh circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin (Mb) concentration and B-mode ultrasound echo-intensity before and for 5 days after MaxECC were compared between groups by a mixed factor ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were observed following 10 %ECC. Following MaxECC, all variables changed significantly, and changes in all variables except for angle at peak torque were significantly different between groups. MVC-CON and ROM decreased smaller and recovered faster (P < 0.05) for Exp than control group, and changes in other variables were smaller (P < 0.05) for Exp group compared with control group. These results suggest that preconditioning knee extensor muscles with low-intensity eccentric contractions was effective for attenuating muscle damage induced by subsequent MaxECC of the knee extensors for elderly individuals.",
      "# Title: Effect of two maximal isometric contractions on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the elbow flexors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the time wise protective effect conferred by two maximal voluntary isometric contractions (2MVCs) at 20° elbow flexion on muscle damage induced by 30 maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors (MaxECC). Sixty-five young untrained men were randomly assigned to a control group that did not perform 2MVCs, or one of four experimental groups (n = 13 per group) who performed 2MVCs either immediately (0d), 2 (2d), 4 (4d) or 7 days (7d) before MaxECC. Changes in maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) concentric torque (MVC-CON), optimum angle (OA), range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following MaxECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were evident following 2MVCs. The 2d and 4d groups showed 16-62 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following MaxECC than the control, 0d and 7d groups. The 2d group showed 14-34 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables except for OA compared with the 4d group. The changes in the variables were similar among the control, 0d and 7d groups. These results show that 2MVCs that were performed between 2 and 4 days before MaxECC attenuated the magnitude of muscle damage, but no such effect was evident if the 2MVCs were performed immediately or 7 days before MaxECC. It is concluded that the protective effect conferred by 2MVCs is relatively short-lived, and there is a window for the effect to be conferred.",
      "# Title: Effect of a prior bout of preconditioning exercise on muscle damage from downhill walking.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether reduced-duration downhill walking (DW) would confer a protective effect against muscle damage induced by a subsequent bout of longer duration DW performed 1 week or 4 weeks later. Healthy young adults were allocated to a control or one of the preconditioning exercise (PRE-1wk or PRE-4wk) groups (10 men and 4 women per group). PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups performed 20-min DW (-28% slope, 5 km/h, 10% body mass added to a backpack) 1 week and 4 weeks before 40-min DW, respectively, and the control group performed 40-min DW only. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) knee extension torque, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity, and muscle soreness (100-mm visual analog scale) were measured before, immediately after, and 24, 48, and 72 h after DW, and the changes in these variables were compared among groups. The control group showed symptoms of muscle damage (e.g., prolonged decrease in MVC: -14% ± 10% at 48 h post-DW) after 40-min DW. Changes in all variables after 40-min DW of PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups were 54%-61% smaller (P < 0.05) than the control group, without significant differences between PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups for MVC and plasma CK activity. Importantly, changes after the preconditioning exercise (20-min DW) were 67%-69% smaller (P < 0.05) than those after the 40-min DW of the control group. These findings suggest that 20-min DW resulting in minor muscle damage conferred a protective effect against subsequent 40-min DW, and its effect could last for more than 4 weeks.",

      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors and flexors protect against muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the magnitude and duration of the protective effect of low-intensity eccentric contractions (LowEC) against damage induced by maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) of the knee flexors (KF) and extensors (KE). Young men were assigned to 8 experimental groups and 2 control groups (n = 13/group); the experimental groups performed LowEC of KF or KE 2 days (2d), 1 week (1wk), 2 weeks (2wk), or 3 weeks (3wk) before MaxEC, while the control groups performed MaxEC of KF or KE without LowEC. The 2d, 1wk, 2wk, and 3wk groups performed 30 LowEC of KF or 60 LowEC of KE with a load of 10% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction strength on a resistance-training machine, and all groups performed 30 MaxEC of KF or 60 MaxEC of KE on an isokinetic dynamometer. Several muscle damage markers were measured from before to 2 days after exercise (LowEC) or from before to 5 days after exercise (MaxEC). No significant changes in any variables were evident after LowEC. The changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2d and 1wk groups (e.g., peak creatine kinase activity: 1002 ± 501 IU/L; peak muscle soreness: 13 ± 5 mm) than for the control group (peak creatine kinase activity: 3005 ± 983 IU/L; peak muscle soreness 28 ± 6 mm) for both KE and KF. There were no significant differences between the 2d and 1wk groups or among the 2wk, 3wk, and control groups. These results show that LowEC provided 30%-66% protection against damage induced by MaxEC of KF and KE, and the protective effect lasted 1 week.",

Small but significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction torque, range of motion (ROM) and plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity were evident at immediately to 2 days post-MVIC (p < 0.05), but other variables (e.g. thigh girth, myoglobin concentration, B-mode echo intensity) did not change significantly. Changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (p < 0.05) by 45% (soreness)-67% (CK) for the experimental than the control group. These results suggest that MVIC conferred potent protective effect against MaxEC-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Prevention of downhill walking-induced muscle damage by non-damaging downhill walking.\n# Abstract: Mountain trekking involves level, uphill, and downhill walking (DW). Prolonged DW induces damage to leg muscles, reducing force generating ability and muscle coordination. These increase risks for more serious injuries and accidents in mountain trekking, thus a strategy to minimize muscle damage is warranted. It has been shown that low-intensity eccentric contractions confer protective effect on muscle damage induced by high-intensity eccentric contractions. This study tested the hypothesis that 5-min non-damaging DW would attenuate muscle damage induced by 40-min DW, but 5-min level walking (LW) would not.",
      "# Title: Isometric pre-conditioning blunts exercise-induced muscle damage but does not attenuate changes in running economy following downhill running.\n# Abstract: Running economy (RE) is impaired following unaccustomed eccentric-biased exercises that induce muscle damage. It is also known that muscle damage is reduced when maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) are performed at a long muscle length 2-4 days prior to maximal eccentric exercise with the same muscle, a phenomenon that can be described as isometric pre-conditioning (IPC). We tested the hypothesis that IPC could attenuate muscle damage and changes in RE following downhill running. Thirty untrained men were randomly assigned into experimental or control groups and ran downhill on a treadmill (-15%) for 30 min. Participants in the experimental group completed 10 MVIC in a leg press machine two days prior to downhill running, while participants in the control group did not perform IPC. The magnitude of changes in muscle soreness determined 48 h after downhill running was greater for the control group (122 ± 28 mm) than for the experimental group (92 ± 38 mm). Isometric peak torque recovered faster in the experimental group compared with the control group (3 days vs. no full recovery, respectively). No significant effect of IPC was found for countermovement jump height, serum creatine kinase activity or any parameters associated with RE. These results supported the hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in markers of muscle damage. The hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in RE was not supported by our data. It appears that the mechanisms involved in changes in markers of muscle damage and parameters associated with RE following downhill running are not completely shared.",
      "# Title: Damage protective effects conferred by low-intensity eccentric contractions on arm, leg and trunk muscles.\n# Abstract: Low-intensity eccentric contractions with a load corresponding to 10% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction strength (10% EC) attenuate muscle damage in a subsequent bout of higher-intensity eccentric contractions performed within 2 weeks for the elbow flexors, knee flexors and knee extensors. However, it is not known whether this strategy could be applied to other muscles. This study investigated whether 10% EC would confer damage protective effect on high-intensity eccentric contractions (80% EC) for nine different muscle groups.",
      "# Title: Protective Effect Conferred by Isometric Preconditioning Against Slow- and Fast-Velocity Eccentric Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage.\n# Abstract: We investigated if the same isometric preconditioning protocol (IPP) attenuates the magnitude of muscle damage induced by different maximal eccentric exercise protocols in the elbow flexors. Sixty-four untrained men were assigned to either two experimental or two control groups. Participants in the experimental groups performed an IPP prior to either slow (60°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-S) or fast (180°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-F) maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC). Subjects in the control groups performed slow (ECC-S) or fast (ECC-F) MaxECC without IPP. Maximal isokinetic concentric torque (MVC), muscle soreness (SOR), and muscle thickness (MT) were assessed before, immediately after, and 1-4 days following the MaxECC. Significant (p < 0.05) group vs. time interactions were found for MVC (F = 4,517), SOR (F = 6,318), and MT (F = 1,863). The ECC-S group presented faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and MT and less (p < 0.05) SOR at 96 h post-MaxECC compared with ECC-F group. No significant differences in MVC and MT were found between ECC-S and ECC-F groups following MaxECC. The ISO + ECC-S group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and SOR compared to the ECC-S group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ECC-S in any variable. The ISO + ECC-F group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of all assessed variables compared with the ECC-F group. MVC was greater (p < 0.05) at 48-72 h, and SOR was less (p < 0.05) at 48-96 h in the ISO + ECC-F compared to the ECC-F group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ISO + ECC-F for any variable. These results show that the IPP accelerated recovery of MVC and SOR for the slow-eccentric exercise condition and attenuated strength loss and SOR in addition to faster recovery of all assessed variables for the fast-eccentric exercise condition. Therefore, the IPP can be used as a strategy to attenuate and accelerate recovery of muscle damage induced by different-velocity eccentric exercises, resulting in greater protection against muscle damage induced by faster velocity."

      "conclusionA": "Performing a non-damaging, low-intensity bout of eccentric exercise, or even isometric contractions, performed between 2 and 4 days prior to a subsequent maximal eccentric exercise bout significantly attenuates markers of muscle damage, such as reduced soreness, smaller decrements in strength, and lower creatine kinase activity, demonstrating a protective effect that can last for at least 1-2 weeks.",
      "conclusionB": "Performing a prior bout of low-to-moderate volume eccentric or isometric exercise—even as little as two maximal isometric contractions or 10-50 eccentric actions—significantly attenuates subsequent exercise-induced muscle damage, typically within a window of 1-2 weeks, regardless of exercise modality (downhill walking, elbow flexors, knee extensors) or contraction velocity; however, this protective effect is not sustained beyond 2-3 weeks."

      "# Title: Cytological diagnostic features of late breast implant seromas: From reactive to anaplastic large cell lymphoma.\n# Abstract: Late breast implant seroma may be the presentation of a breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BI-ALCL), which claims for a prompt recognition. However, BI-ALCL diagnosis on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) might be challenging for pathologists lacking experience with peri-implant breast effusions. Sixty-seven late breast implant seromas collected by FNA from 50 patients were evaluated by Papanicolaou smear stain and immunocytochemistry on cell blocks. A diagnostic algorithm based on the cellular composition, cell morphology and percentage of CD30+ cells was developed. Histological evaluation of the corresponding peri-prosthetic capsules was also performed. Most of the effusions (91% of the samples) were classified as reactive and 9% as BI-ALCL. In the BI-ALCL cases, medium-to-large atypical cells expressing CD30 represented more than 70% of the cellularity, whereas in in the reactive effusions CD30+ elements were extremely rare (<5%) and consisted of non-atypical elements. The reactive effusions were categorized into three patterns: i) acute infiltrate with prominent neutrophilic component (33% of the samples); ii) mixed infiltrate characterized by a variable number of neutrophils, lymphocytes and macrophages (30% of the samples); iii) chronic infiltrate composed predominantly of T lymphocytes or macrophages with only sporadic granulocytes (37% of the samples). The inflammatory cytological patterns were consistent with the histology of the corresponding capsules. Our results indicate that cytological analysis of late breast implant effusions, supported by the knowledge of the heterogeneous cytomorphological spectrum of late seromas, is a valuable approach for the early recognition of BI-ALCL.",

Its etiology unknown, one hypothesis suggests an initiating inflammatory stimulus, possibly infectious, triggers BIA-ALCL. We analyzed microbiota of breast, skin, implant and capsule in BIA-ALCL patients (n = 7), and controls via culturing methods, 16S rRNA microbiome sequencing, and immunohistochemistry. Alpha and beta diversity metrics and relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria were calculated, and phylogenetic trees constructed. Staphylococcus spp., the most commonly cultured microbes, were identified in both the BIA-ALCL and contralateral control breast. The diversity of bacterial microbiota did not differ significantly between BIA-ALCL and controls for any material analyzed. Further, there were no significant differences in the relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria between BIA-ALCL and control specimens. Heat maps suggested substantial diversity in the composition of the bacterial microbiota of the skin, breast, implant and capsule between patients with no clear trend to distinguish BIA-ALCL from controls. While we identified no consistent differences between patients with BIA-ALCL-affected and contralateral control breasts, this study provides insights into the composition of the breast microbiota in this population.",

We investigated whether bacteria could trigger the activation and multiplication of BIA-ALCL cells in vitro. BIA-ALCL patient-derived BIA-ALCL tumor cells, BIA-ALCL cell lines, cutaneous ALCL cell lines, an immortal T-cell line (MT-4), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from BIA-ALCL, capsular contracture, and primary augmentation patients were studied. Cells were subjected to various mitogenic stimulation assays including plant phytohemagglutinin (PHA), Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Staphylococcal superantigens enterotoxin A (SEA), toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), or sterilized implant shells. Patient-derived BIA-ALCL tumor cells and BIA-ALCL cell lines showed a unique response to LPS stimulation. This response was dampened significantly in the presence of a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) inhibitor peptide. In contrast, cutaneous ALCL cells, MT-4, and PBMC cells from all patients responded significantly more to PHA, SEA, and TSST-1 than to LPS. Breast implant shells of all surface grades alone did not produce a proliferative response of BIA-ALCL cells, indicating the breast implant does not act as a pro-inflammatory stimulant. These findings indicate a possible novel pathway for LPS to promote BIA-ALCL cell proliferation via a TLR4 receptor-mediated bacterial transformation of T-cells into malignancy."

Results: A total of 49 patients were enrolled in the study (23 in the experimental group and 26 in the control group). The degree of stress reaction of the experimental group was lighter than that of the control group. The levels of CRP were significantly different on the 5th and 7th day after operation, IL-6 was significantly different on the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th day after operation, WBC and HOMA-IR were significantly different on the 1st day postoperatively.

This study analyzes the trend of malnutrition prevalence rates between 2007 and 2011 in the long-term care sector, and the related effects of(1) process indicators such as nutritional screening and treatment and 2) structural indicators (guideline, protocol or nutritional screening policy). From 2007 to 2011, the Dutch National Prevalence Measurement of Care Problems (LPZ) was performed in Dutch long-term care organizations using a standardized questionnaire involving measurements at institutional, ward and resident level. The data were analyzed by mixed-linear regression for longitudinal data. Presence of malnutrition was assessed by BMI, undesired weight loss and nutritional intake. Seventy-four care homes were included (26,101 residents). The malnutrition prevalence trend significantly decreased (P < 0.001) from 26% to 18% from 2007 to 2011. In the final model of the mixed effects analysis only the interacted process indicators nutritional screening and oral nutritional supplementation (ONS) were significant in influencing malnutrition prevalence rates over time. Structural indicators had no impact on the malnutrition prevalence over time. In conclusion, over time a lower prevalence of malnutrition is associated with a higher degree of nutritional screening. As might be expected, a higher prevalence of malnutrition is associated with higher use of ONS.

In the present study, the same measurement methodology and instruments were used in The Netherlands, Germany and Austria. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether resident characteristics influence possible differences in malnutrition prevalence between countries. The study followed a cross-sectional, multi-centre design that measured malnutrition in nursing home residents from The Netherlands, Germany and Austria. Resident data were gathered using a standardised questionnaire. Malnutrition was operationalised using BMI, unintentional weight loss and nutritional intake. Data were analysed using an association model. The prevalence rates of malnutrition in The Netherlands, Germany and Austria were 18·3, 20·1 and 22·5 %, respectively. The multivariate generalised estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression analysis showed that sex, age, care dependency, the mean number of diseases and some specific diseases were influencing factors for whether the resident was malnourished or not. The OR of malnutrition in the three countries declined after including the influencing factors resulting from the multivariate GEE analysis. The present study reveals that differences in the prevalence rates of malnutrition in nursing homes in The Netherlands, Germany and Austria are influenced by different resident characteristics. Since other country-related factors could also play an important role in influencing differences in the prevalence rates of malnutrition between the countries (structural and process factors of malnutrition care policy).

The current study analyzed the clinical significance of this new stage in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Subjects and Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 4045 eligible PTC patients. The patients were divided into four groups according to the extent of ETE: no ETE, ETE into perithyroidal tissue, T3b (ETE into the strap muscles), and ETE beyond the strap muscles. Differences in the clinical characteristics and prognosis of the four groups were assessed. Results: Of these 4045 patients, 2300 (56.9%) had no ETE, 1004 (24.8%) had ETE into perithyroidal tissue, 371 (9.2%) had ETE into the strap muscles, and 370 (9.1%) had ETE beyond the strap muscles. Tumor size, multifocality, lymph node metastasis (LNM), distant metastasis (DM), recurrence, and recurrence-free survival (RFS) between patients with ETE into perithyroidal tissue and patients without ETE did not show differences, but significant differences were observed between patients with T3b and patients without ETE, and only patients with ETE beyond the strap muscles had significantly worse overall survival (OS) than the other three groups. However, T3b did not independently predict worse RFS in univariable and multivariable analyses. Conclusions: T3b, distinguished from minimal ETE, may be related to larger tumor size, higher prevalence of multifocality, LNM, DM, recurrence, and worse RFS than no ETE, but it may not affect OS and may not independently predict recurrence in PTC patients.",
      "# Title: Is There a Difference Between Minimal and Gross Extension into the Strap Muscles for the Risk of Recurrence in Papillary Thyroid Carcinomas?\n# Abstract: Background: The morbidity of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is primarily related to locoregional recurrences and distant metastases. The definition of minimal extrathyroidal extension (mETE) has been recently revised. The presence of mETE does not impact mortality and is generally not considered to be a predictor for the risk of recurrence. This study aimed at comparing the risk of recurrence and the response to therapy of PTC with mETE and gross extrathyroidal extension (ETE) into the strap muscles (gETE) with low- and intermediate-risk PTC without ETE (low risk w/o ETE and intermediate risk w/o ETE, respectively) to further characterize the impact of ETE on outcomes. Methods: A total of 596 PTCs were analyzed according to the degree of ETE as well as other predictors of recurrence. Four groups of patients were compared, low risk w/o ETE (n = 251), intermediate risk w/o ETE (n = 89), mETE (n = 191), and gETE (n = 65), to determine the risk of recurrence and the response to treatment. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate associations between groups and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: The risk of recurrence was 3% in low risk w/o ETE PTC, 14% in intermediate risk w/o ETE, 14% in mETE, and 25% in gETE. The recurrence risk was increased by the presence of ETE (odds ratio [OR] = 2.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-5.85, p = 0.005) and lymph node metastases (OR = 2.44 [95% CI 1.25-4.76], p = 0.009). Patients with low-risk carcinomas w/o ETE experienced longer DFS than those with mETE (hazard ratio = 0.08 [95% CI 0.02-0.28], p < 0.001), but no significant difference was observed between intermediate risk w/o ETE, mETE, and gETE. In terms of the response to therapy, patients with gETE had higher rates of biochemical and/or structural incomplete responses within the first year of treatment (OR = 2.68 [95% CI 1.31-5.45], p = 0.007) and at the final follow-up evaluation (OR = 4.35 [95% CI 1.99-9.51], p < 0.001) compared with those with mETE. An analysis of the subgroups of microcarcinomas without lymph node metastases revealed no significant difference in DFS or the response to therapy between the low risk w/o ETE and mETE PTC groups. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that both mETE and gETE are independent risk factors for the risk of recurrence in PTC. Although gETE has a more pronounced impact on the recurrence risk and is associated with a worse response to therapy, mETE may not be associated with a low risk of recurrence. This observation suggests that patients with PTC and mETE may, in part, have an intermediate risk of recurrence and need to be followed accordingly."

Our approach in vaccine development uses recombinant expression of the highly immunogenic HAV antigen VP1-P2a in food-grade lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis and in Escherichia coli. We used genetic constructs that enable nisin-controlled expression of the antigen in L. lactis in three different forms: (a) intracellularly, (b) on the bacterial surface and (c) on the bacterial surface fused with the fragment of the E. coli flagellin molecule that can act as a molecular adjuvant. Expression of the two surface forms of the antigen was achieved in L. lactis, and the resulting antigen-displaying bacteria were administered orally to mice. Half the animals in each of the two groups developed specific IgGs, with titers increasing over time and reaching 1:422 without flagellin and 1:320 with flagellin. A much higher titer 1:25,803 was observed with the parenterally administered antigen, which was purified from E. coli. With the latter, a significant mucosal IgA response was also observed. Despite significant titers, the IgGs elicited with oral or parenteral administration could not prevent HAV from infecting cells in a virus neutralization assay, suggesting that the antibodies cannot recognize viral surface epitopes. Nevertheless, orally administered HAV antigen expressed in L. lactis elicited significant systemic humoral immune response showing the feasibility for development of effective HAV vaccine for mucosal delivery.",

However, conventional technologies for preparing an injectable vaccine require purification of the antigenic protein and preparation of an adjuvant. Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 (L. lactis) could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of edible vaccine. In previous study, we constructed a multi-epitope vaccine, designated CTB-UE, which is composed of the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), three Th cell epitopes and two B-cell epitopes from urease subunits. To develop a novel type of oral vaccine against H. pylori, genetically modified L. lactis strains were established to secrete this epitope vaccine extracellularly in this study. Oral prophylactic immunization with recombinant L. lactis significantly elicited humoral anti-urease antibody responses (P < 0.001) and reduced the gastric colonization of H. pylori from 7.14 ± 0.95 to 4.68 ± 0.98 log10 CFU g(-1) stomach. This L. lactis oral vaccine offers a promising vaccine candidate for the control of H. pylori infection.",
      "# Title: Development of a new DNA vaccine based on mycobacterial ESAT-6 antigen delivered by recombinant invasive Lactococcus lactis FnBPA+.\n# Abstract: The use of the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis as a vehicle for the oral delivery of DNA vaccine plasmids constitutes a promising strategy for vaccination. The delivery of DNA plasmids into eukaryotic cells is of critical importance for subsequent DNA expression and effectiveness of the vaccine. In this context, the use of the recombinant invasive L. lactis FnBPA+ (fibronectin-binding protein A) strain for the oral delivery of the eukaryotic expression vector vaccination using lactic acid bacteria (pValac), coding for the 6-kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6) gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, could represent a new DNA vaccine strategy against tuberculosis. To this end, the ESAT-6 sequence was cloned into the pValac vector; the L. lactis fibronectin-binding protein A (FnBPA)+ (pValac:ESAT-6) strain was obtained, and its immunological profile was checked in BALB/c mice. This strain was able to significantly increase interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production in spleen cells, showing a systemic T helper 1 (Th1) cell response. The mice also showed a significant increase in specific secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) production in colon tissue and fecal extracts. Thus, this is the first time that L. lactis has been used to deliver a plasmid DNA harboring a gene that encodes an antigen against tuberculosis through mucous membranes.",
      "# Title: Lactococcus lactis displayed neuraminidase confers cross protective immunity against influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Influenza A viruses pose a serious threat to public health. Current influenza A vaccines predominantly focus on hemagglutinin (HA) and show strain-specific protection. Neuraminidase (NA) is much less studied in the context of humoral immunity against influenza A viruses. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cross protective immunity of NA presented on Lactococcus lactis (L.lactis) surface against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in the mouse model. L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA was constructed in which pgsA was used as an anchor protein. Mice vaccinated orally with L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA could elicit significant NA-specific serum IgG and mucosa IgA antibodies, as well as neuraminidase inhibition (NI) titers. Importantly, L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA provided 80% protection against H5N1, 60% protection against H3N2 and H1N1, respectively. These findings suggest that recombinant L.lactis/pNZ110-pgsA-NA in the absence of adjuvant via oral administration can be served as an effective vaccine candidate against diverse strains of influenza A viruses.",
      "# Title: Broadly protective immunity against divergent influenza viruses by oral co-administration of Lactococcus lactis expressing nucleoprotein adjuvanted with cholera toxin B subunit in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines need to be annually reformulated to well match the predicated circulating strains. Thus, it is critical for developing a novel universal influenza vaccine that would be able to confer cross-protection against constantly emerging divergent influenza virus strains. Influenza virus A is a genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses. Influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) is a structural protein which encapsidates the negative strand viral RNA, and anti-NP antibodies play role in cross-protective immunity. Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) is an ideal vaccine delivery vehicle via oral administration route. However, L. lactis vectored vaccine exhibits poor immunogenicity without the use of mucosal adjuvant. To enhance the immunogenicity of L. lactis vectored vaccine, cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit, one of mucosal adjuvants, is a safe adjuvant for oral route, when combined with L. lactis vectored vaccine. In this study, we hypothesized that pNZ8008, a L. lactis expression plasmid, encoding NP antigen, would be able to elicit cross-protection with the use of CTB via oral administration route.",
      "# Title: Cross-protection of Lactococcus lactis-displayed HA2 subunit against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines provide strain-specific protection against homologous subtypes and need to be updated annually. Therefore, it is essential to develop a universal vaccine that would induce broadly cross-protective immunity against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses. The highly conserved HA2 subunit is a promising candidate for developing a universal influenza vaccine. Here, we hypothesized that the HA2 subunit could be displayed on the surface of Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis), using Spax as an anchor protein (L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2) and that L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 would have immunogenicity by oral administration without the use of adjuvant in the mouse model. To address this hypothesis, we show that oral vaccination of mice with L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 elicited significant humoral and mucosal immune responses. Importantly, L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 provided 100% protection against homologous H5N1 or heterologous H1N1 virus challenge. These results suggest that an HA2 subunit presented on the surface of L. lactis is an effective universal vaccine candidate against influenza A viruses in the poultry industry and in humans.",
      "# Title: Oral Immunization with a Recombinant Lactococcus lactis-Expressing HIV-1 Antigen on Group A Streptococcus Pilus Induces Strong Mucosal Immunity in the Gut.\n# Abstract: The induction of a potent humoral and cellular immune response in mucosal tissue is important for the development of an effective HIV vaccine. Most of the current HIV vaccines under development use the i.m. route for immunization, which is relatively poor in generating potent and long-lived mucosal immune responses. In this article, we explore the ability of an oral vaccination with a probiotic organism, Lactococcus lactis, to elicit HIV-specific immune responses in the mucosal and systemic compartments of BALB/c mice. We expressed the HIV-1 Gag-p24 on the tip of the T3 pilus of Streptococcus pyogenes as a fusion to the Cpa protein (LL-Gag). After four monthly LL-Gag oral immunizations, we observed strong Gag-specific IgG and IgA responses in serum, feces, and vaginal secretions. However, the Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses in the blood were at or below our detection limit. After an i.m. modified vaccinia Ankara/Gag boost, we observed robust Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses both in systemic and in mucosal tissues, including intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes of the small intestine, Peyer's patches, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Consistent with strong immunogenicity, the LL-Gag induced activation of CD11c(+) CD11b(+) dendritic cells in the Peyer's patches after oral immunization. Our results demonstrate that oral immunization with L. lactis expressing an Ag on the tip of the group A Streptococcus pilus serves as an excellent vaccine platform to induce strong mucosal humoral and cellular immunity against HIV.",

      "# Title: Production and delivery of Helicobacter pylori NapA in Lactococcus lactis and its protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity.\n# Abstract: Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein A subunit (NapA) has been identified as a virulence factor, a protective antigen and a potent immunomodulator. NapA shows unique application potentials for anti-H. pylori vaccines and treatment strategies of certain allergic diseases and carcinomas. However, appropriate production and utilization modes of NapA still remain uncertain to date. This work has established a novel efficient production and utilization mode of NapA by using L. lactis as an expression host and delivery vector, and demonstrated immune protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity of the engineered L. lactis by oral vaccination of mice. It was observed for the first time that H. pylori NapA promotes both polarized Th17 and Th1 responses, which may greatly affect the clinical application of NapA. This report offers a promising anti-H. pylori oral vaccine candidate and a potent mucosal immune modulatory agent. Meanwhile, it uncovers a way to produce and deliver the oral vaccine and immunomodulator by fermentation of food like milk, which might have striking effects on control of H. pylori infection, gastrointestinal cancers, and Th2 bias allergic diseases, including many food allergies.",
      "# Title: Protective immunity induced by an intranasal multivalent vaccine comprising 10 Lactococcus lactis strains expressing highly prevalent M-protein antigens derived from Group A Streptococcus.\n# Abstract: Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) causes diseases ranging from mild pharyngitis to severe invasive infections. The N-terminal fragment of streptococcal M protein elicits protective antibodies and is an attractive vaccine target. However, this N- terminal fragment is hypervariable: there are more than 200 different M types. In this study, an intranasal live bacterial vaccine comprising 10 strains of Lactococcus lactis, each expressing one N-terminal fragment of M protein, has been developed. Live bacterial-vectored vaccines cost less to manufacture because the processes involved are less complex than those required for production of protein subunit vaccines. Moreover, intranasal administration does not require syringes or specialized personnel. Evaluation of individual vaccine types (M1, M2, M3, M4, M6, M9, M12, M22, M28 and M77) showed that most of them protected mice against challenge with virulent S. pyogenes. All 10 strains combined in a 10-valent vaccine (M×10) induced serum and bronchoalveolar lavage IgG titers that ranged from three- to 10-fold those of unimmunized mice. After intranasal challenge with M28 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice was significantly higher than that of unimmunized mice. In contrast, when mice were challenged with M75 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice did not differ significantly from that of unimmunized mice. Mx-10 immunized mice had significantly less S. pyogenes in oropharyngeal washes and developed less severe disease symptoms after challenge than did unimmunized mice. Our L. lactis-based vaccine may provide an alternative solution to development of broadly protective group A streptococcal vaccines.",
      "# Title: Mucosal and systemic immune responses elicited by recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a fusion protein composed of pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin from Bordetella pertussis.\n# Abstract: We constructed a food-grade expression system harboring a F1S1 fusion protein of Bordetella pertussis to be produced in Lactococcus lactis NZ3900 as a new oral vaccine model against whooping cough, caused by B. pertussis. F1S1 was composed of N-terminally truncated S1 subunit of pertussis toxin and type I immunodominant domain of filamentous hemagglutinin which are both known as protective immunogens against pertussis. The recombinant L. lactis was administered via oral or intranasal routes to BALB/c mice and the related specific systemic and mucosal immune responses were then evaluated. The results indicated significantly higher levels of specific IgA in the lung extracts and IgG in sera of mucosally-immunized mice, compared to their controls. It was revealed that higher levels of IgG2a, compared to IgG1, were produced in all mucosally-immunized mice. Moreover, immunized mice developed Th1 responses with high levels of IFN-γ production by the spleen cells. These findings provide evidence for L. lactis to be used as a suitable vehicle for expression and delivery of F1S1 fusion protein to mucosa and induction of appropriate systemic and mucosal immune responses against pertussis.",
      "# Title: Rotavirus VP6 protein mucosally delivered by cell wall-derived particles from Lactococcus lactis induces protection against infection in a murine model.\n# Abstract: Rotaviruses are the primary cause of acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide. Although the implementation of live attenuated vaccines has reduced the number of rotavirus-associated deaths, variance in their effectiveness has been reported in different countries. This fact, among other concerns, leads to continuous efforts for the development of new generation of vaccines against rotavirus.In this work, we describe the obtention of cell wall-derived particles from a recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a cell wall-anchored version of the rotavirus VP6 protein. After confirming by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, flow cytometry and electronic immunomicroscopy that these particles were carrying the VP6 protein, their immunogenic potential was evaluated in adult BALB/c mice. For that, mucosal immunizations (oral or intranasal), with or without the dmLT [(double mutant Escherichia coli heat labile toxin LT(R192G/L211A)] adjuvant were performed. The results showed that these cell wall-derived particles were able to generate anti-rotavirus IgG and IgA antibodies only when administered intranasally, whether the adjuvant was present or not. However, the presence of dmLT was necessary to confer protection against rotavirus infection, which was evidenced by a 79.5 percent viral shedding reduction.In summary, this work describes the production of cell wall-derived particles which were able to induce a protective immune response after intranasal immunization. Further studies are needed to characterize the immune response elicited by these particles as well as to determine their potential as an alternative to the use of live L. lactis for mucosal antigen delivery.",

Thereafter, in order to assess the immunogenicity of recombinant L. lactis cells, C57BL/6 mice were immunized by oral gavage.",
      "# Title: A Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB)-Based Vaccine Candidate for Human Norovirus.\n# Abstract: Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are responsible for more than 95% of the non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis epidemics in the world. The CDC estimates that every year 21 million individuals suffer from HuNoV-induced gastroenteritis in the United States. Currently, there is no FDA-approved vaccine for HuNoVs. Development of an effective vaccine has been hampered by the lack of an efficient cell culture system for HuNoVs and a suitable small animal model for pathogenesis study. In this study, we developed lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as a vector to deliver HuNoV antigen. A LAB strain (Lactococcus lactis) carrying VP1 gene of a HuNoV GII.4 virus (LAB-VP1) was constructed. It was found that HuNoV VP1 protein was highly expressed by LAB vector and was secreted into media supernatants. To test whether LAB-based HuNoV vaccine candidate is immunogenic, 4-day-old gnotobiotic piglets were orally inoculated with various doses of LAB-VP1. It was found that LABs were persistent in the small intestine of piglets and shed in pig feces for at least 25 days post inoculation. LAB DNA and VP1 were detected in mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen tissue in LAB-VP1 inoculated groups. HuNoV-specific IgG and IgA were detectable in serum and feces respectively at day 13 post-inoculation, and further increased at later time points. After being challenged with HuNoV GII.4 strain, a large amount of HuNoV antigens were observed in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum sections of the intestine in the LAB control group. In contrast, significantly less, or no, HuNoV antigens were detected in the LAB-VP1 immunized groups. Collectively, these results demonstrate that a LAB-based HuNoV vaccine induces protective immunity in gnotobiotic piglets.",

      "# Title: Mucosal Vaccination with Lactococcus lactis-Secreting Surface Immunological Protein Induces Humoral and Cellular Immune Protection against Group B Streptococcus in a Murine Model.\n# Abstract: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the primary etiological agent of sepsis and meningitis in newborns and is associated with premature birth and stillbirth. The development of a licensed vaccine is one of the pending challenges for the World Health Organization. Previously, we showed that oral immunization with surface immune protein (SIP) decreases vaginal colonization of GBS and generates functional opsonizing antibodies, which was determined by opsonophagocytic assays (OPA) in vitro. We also showed that the protein has an adjuvant vaccine profile. Therefore, an oral vaccine based on SIP may be an attractive alternative to employ in the development of new vaccines against GBS. Lactococcus lactis is a highlighted oral vaccine probiotic inducer of the mucosal immune response. This bacterium could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of an edible vaccine and has been used in clinical trials. In this study, we showed that an oral vaccine with a recombinant L. lactis strain secreting SIP from GBS (rL. lactis-SIP) can induce protective humoral and cellular immunity in an experimental model of GBS vaginal colonization in C57BL/6 mice. Mice immunized with rL. lactis-SIP were protected against clinical symptoms and bacterial colonization after GBS vaginal colonization. Our rL. lactis-SIP vaccine also induces an increase of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) specifically against SIP. The adoptive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice to naïve mice generated protection against GBS vaginal colonization. Moreover, the rL. lactis-SIP strain induces the activation of SIP-specific T cells, which could decrease GBS vaginal colonization and generate protective antibodies when transferred to other mice. Our experimental observations strongly support the notion that rL. lactis-SIP induces protective humoral and cellular immunity and could be considered as a novel alternative in the development of vaccines for GBS.",
      "# Title: Recombinant Lactococcus Lactis Displaying Omp31 Antigen of Brucella melitensis Can Induce an Immunogenic Response in BALB/c Mice.\n# Abstract: Since Brucella infection mostly occurs through the mucosal surfaces, immune response induced by vaccine that is delivered by a way of mucosal route can be drastically enhanced to control the brucellosis. Omp31is the major outer membrane protein of Brucella, and is considered as a protective antigen against Brucella infection. Accordingly, Lactococcus lactis has been used as an antigen-delivering vector to develop a vaccine-induced mucosal response for having a safer vaccination against brucellosis. A designed omp31 gene fused to the usp45 signal peptide and M6 cell wall anchor was sub cloned in the pNZ7021 expression vector, and a recombinant L. lactis displaying Omp31 was constructed. Omp31 protein expression was confirmed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. Animals were orally and intraperitoneally immunized with live or killed L. lactis expressing Omp31, respectively. The humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated by measuring the specific cytokines and antibodies. sIgA, serum IgA, IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in the mice immunized with live recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31 and also serum IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in mice immunized with killed recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31. Among IgG subtypes, IgG2a response was significantly higher in both groups compared to IgG1. In mice groups immunized with recombinant L. lactis, the IFN-γ and IL-10 level elevated; however, there was no change in the level of IL-4. These results indicated that recombinants L. lactis induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, and also vaccines based on L. lactis-derived live carriers are promising interventions against Brucella melitensis infections.",
      "# Title: Lactococcus lactis FNBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) Induces Cellular and Humoral Immune Responses After Oral Immunization of Mice.\n# Abstract: The development of a new vaccine strategy against tuberculosis is urgently needed and has been greatly encouraged by the scientific community worldwide. In this work, we constructed a lactococcal DNA vaccine based on the fusion of two Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens, ESAT-6 and Ag85A, and examined its immunogenicity. The coding sequences of the ESAT-6 and Ag85A genes were fused and cloned into the eukaryotic expression pValac vector, and the functionality of the vector was confirmed in vitro. Then, L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) was obtained and used for oral immunization of mice. This strain induced significant increases in IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-17 cytokines in stimulated splenocyte cultures, and significant production of antigen-specific sIgA was observed in the colonic tissues of immunized mice. We demonstrated that L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) generated a cellular and humoral immune response after oral immunization of mice. The strategy developed in this work may represent an interesting DNA mucosal vaccine candidate against tuberculosis, using the fusion of two highly immunogenic antigens delivered by safe lactic acid bacteria.",
      "# Title: Protective Immunity Against Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli by Oral Vaccination of Engineered Lactococcus lactis.\n# Abstract: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the leading causes of diarrhea in children globally, and thus suitable vaccines are desired. Antigen display on lactic acid bacteria is a reliable approach for efficient oral vaccination and preventing bowel diseases. To develop an oral vaccine against ETEC, the gene of the binding domain from heat-labile toxin (LTB), a key ETEC virulence factor, was codon-optimized and cloned into a construct containing a signal peptide and an anchor for display on L. lactis. Bioinformatics analysis showed a codon adaptation index of 0.95 for the codon-optimized gene. Cell surface expression of LTB was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and blotting. White New Zealand rabbits were immunized per os (PO) with the recombinant L. lactis, and the antibody titers were assayed with ELISA. In vitro neutralization assay was performed using mouse adrenal tumor cells and rabbit ileal loop test was performed as the in vivo assay. ELISA results indicated that oral administration of the engineered L. lactis elicited a significant production of IgA in the intestine. In vitro neutralization assay showed that the effect of the toxin could be neutralized with 500 µg/ml of IgG isolated from the oral vaccine group. Furthermore, the dose of ETEC causing fluid accumulation in the ileal loop test showed a tenfold increase in rabbits immunized with either recombinant L. lactis or LTB protein compared to other groups. Our results imply that recombinant L. lactis could potentially be an effective live oral vaccine against ETEC toxicity.",
      "# Title: Oral Immunization of Mice with Cell Extracts from Recombinant Lactococcus lactis Expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein.\n# Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all over the world and became a pandemic that named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). At present, several intramuscular vaccines have been successfully developed and mass vaccination has progressed in many countries. The aim of the study is to develop and examine an oral vaccine against COVID-19 with recombinant Lactococcus lactis IL1403, a strain of lactic acid bacteria, expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) S1 subunit as an immunizing antigen. PBS or cell extracts from recombinant L. lactis were orally administered into mice (control VS treatment), and formation of antigen-specific antibodies and changes in the gut microbiome were analyzed. Intracellular antigen was detected, but its secretion was not successful. After immunization, antigen-specific serum IgG and fecal IgA levels were 1.5-fold (P = 0.002) and 1.4-fold (P = 0.016) higher in the immunized mice (treatment) than control, respectively. Gut microbiome profiles were clearly separated between the two groups when analyzed for beta diversity with overall similarity. At the genus level, while Coprococcus (P = 0.036) and unclassified genus of Ruminococcaceae (P = 0.037) in treatment were more abundant than control, rc4-4 (P = 0.013) and Stenotrophomonas (P = 0.021) were less abundant. Our results indicate that cell extract containing SARS-CoV-2 antigen can induce mice to produce antigen-specific antibodies without overall changes in the gut microbiome. This strategy may be useful for the development of other oral viral vaccines.",
      "# Title: Oral Immunization With a M Cell-Targeting Recombinant L. Lactis Vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE Stimulate Protective Immunity Against H. Pylori in Mice.\n# Abstract: There are many virulence factors of H. pylori that contribute in diverse ways to gastric disease. Therefore, designing multivalent epitope vaccines against many key virulence factors virulence factors of H. pylori is a promising strategy to control H. pylori infection. In previous studies, we constructed a multivalent epitope vaccine FVpE against four key virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), and oral immunization with the FVpE vaccine plus a polysaccharide adjuvant (PA) containing lycium barbarum polysaccharide and chitosan could provide protection against H. pylori infection in the Mongolian gerbil model. Oral vaccines have many advantages over injected vaccines, such as improved safety and compliance, and easier manufacturing and administration. However, the harsh gastrointestinal (GI) environment, such as gastric acid and proteolytic enzymes, limits the development of oral vaccines to some extent. Oral vaccines need a gastrointestinal delivery system with high safety, low price and promoting vaccine antigen to stimulate immune response in the gastrointestinal mucosa. Lactic acid bacteria are gastrointestinal probiotics that have unique advantages as a delivery system for oral vaccines. In this study, a M cell-targeting surface display system for L. lactis named plSAM was designed to help vaccine antigens to stimulate effective immune responses in the gastrointestinal tract, and a M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE was constructed by using the surface display system plSAM. recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE could secretively express the SAM-FVpE protein and display it on the bacterial surface. Moreover, experimental results confirmed that LL-plSAM-FVpE had an enhanced M cell-targeting property. In addition, LL-plSAM-FVpE had excellent M cell-targeting property to promote the phagocytosis and transport of the antigen SAM-FVpE by gastrointestinal M cells. More importantly, oral immunization of LL-plSAM-FVpE or SAM-FVpE plus PA can stimulate IgG and sIgA antibodies and CD4+ T cell immune responses against four virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), thus providing protective immunity against H. pylori infection in mice. The M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine against various key H. pylori virulence factors could be a promising vaccine candidate for controlling H. pylori infection.",
      "# Title: Oral and intranasal immunization with food-grade recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing high conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein triggers mice's immunity responses.\n# Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic began at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread throughout the world. Vaccination is still the most effective method of prevention of pathogenic infections, including viral infections. However, there is little evidence that vaccination can protect against SARS-CoV-2 virus for a long time. Thus, regular re-vaccination is necessary to control COVID-19. Vaccination by injection is invasive, and is one of the reasons people refuse to get re-vaccinated. Therefore, we developed a less invasive vaccine based on oral or nasal administration. The gene encoding the high conserved region (HCR) spike protein was inserted into pNZ8149 and expressed in L.lactis NZ3900. Mice were immunized at 3-week intervals with oral or nasal routes. Anti-SARS-CoV2 spike antibody (IgG and IgA) level were measured using ELISA method before and after treatment. Plasma cells population in lymph were analyzed using flowcytometry and the CD4 + and CD8 + cells in lymph and intestine were analyzed using immunofluorescence method. The results of nasal and oral administration in experimental animals showed that L.lactis carrying the HCR gene could induce a humoral immune response, as indicated by increased levels of IgG and IgA against SARS-CoV-2 (IgG/IgA-SARS-CoV-2). The plasma cell population after nasal and oral vaccination in mice were significantly different with control group (p < 0.05). The CD4 + and CD8 + cells in intestine were significantly higher in orally immunized group mice than control group. The CD8 + cells in lymph were significantly higher in intranasal immunized group mice than control group. Our data demonstrate L.lactis expressing spike protein can be developed into a less invasive alternative to nasal and oral vaccination.",
      "# Title: Expanding strain coverage of a group A Streptococcus pilus-expressing Lactococcus lactis mucosal vaccine.\n# Abstract: Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a human pathogenic bacterium that can trigger a wide range of diseases, including the autoimmune diseases acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, causing major morbidity and mortality in many low- and middle-income countries. Primary intervention programs have had limited success thus far, and a licensed vaccine has yet to be developed. The pilus of GAS is known to be involved in host cell adhesion, biofilm formation and immune evasion. We have a mucosal vaccine in development that expresses the pilus of GAS on the surface of the nonpathogenic bacterium Lactococcus lactis. To expand strain coverage, we combined seven L. lactis constructs, each expressing a different GAS pilus variant, and investigated the systemic and mucosal immune responses following immunization. Mice immunized with this combination showed specific immunoglobin G and immunoglobin A responses to the GAS pilus proteins of vaccine strains, at levels comparable to mice immunized with a single construct. Cross-reactivity to pilus proteins of nonvaccine strains was also evident. Furthermore, protective efficacy against a homologous strain of GAS in a murine nasopharyngeal colonization model was observed. Overall, this study provides further evidence for using pilus-expressing lactic acid bacteria as a vaccine to prevent upper respiratory tract GAS infections."

      "# Title: The modified frailty index and 30-day adverse events in oncologic neurosurgery.\n# Abstract: The modified frailty index (mFI) is emerging as a leading measure for preoperative risk assessment using routinely available medical record data. Our objective was to determine if mFI predicts morbidity and mortality in the diverse national cohort of patients undergoing neurosurgery for intracranial neoplasms. We identified patients in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program who underwent oncologic neurosurgery procedures between 2008 and 2012. The mFI, ranging from 0 to 1, was calculated as the proportion of 11 possible risk factors present. We assessed the associations between mFI and 30-day mortality, neurologic and medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge in univariate and multivariable analyses and compare the index to established risk stratification techniques. A total of 9149 patients were identified. Mortality, severe medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge increased incrementally with increasing levels of frailty. Severe neurologic complications were highest in those with low frailty. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, increased frailty increased the odds of all adverse outcomes, including neurologic complications. The mFI increased the ability to predict all outcomes beyond available indices and was the most reliable predictor of neurologic complications. The mFI can be calculated from routinely collected medical record data and is predictive of 30-day adverse outcomes in a wide variety of neurosurgical oncology patients. The index may be a useful component of preoperative risk assessment with implications for shared decision-making, perioperative planning, and risk adjusted outcomes measurement in national quality registries.",

      "# Title: Frailty and outcomes after craniotomy for brain tumor.\n# Abstract: Frailty has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in a variety of surgical disciplines. Few data exist regarding the relationship of frailty with adverse outcomes in craniotomy for brain tumor resection. We assessed the relationship between frailty and the incidence of major post-operative complication, discharge destination other than home, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality after elective craniotomy for brain tumor resection. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 20,333 adult patients undergoing elective craniotomy for tumor resection in the 2012-2018 ACS-NSQIP Participant Use File. Multivariate logistic regression was performed using all covariates deemed eligible through clinical and statistical significance. 6,249 patients (30.7%) were low-frailty and 2,148 patients (10.6%) were medium-to-high frailty. In multivariate logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, BMI, ASA classification, smoking status, dyspnea, significant pre-operative weight loss, chronic steroid use, bleeding disorder, tumor type, and operative time, low frailty was associated with increased adjusted odds ratio of major complication (1.41, 95% CI: 1.23-1.60, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.32, 95% CI: 1.20-1.46, p < 0.001), 30-day readmission (1.29, 95% CI: 1.15-1.44, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (1.87, 95% CI: 1.41-2.47, p < 0.001). Moderate-to-high frailty was also associated with increased adjusted odds of major complication (1.61, 95% CI: 1.35-1.92, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.80, 95% CI: 1.58-2.05), 30-day readmission (1.39, 95% CI: 1.19-1.62, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (2.42, 95% CI: 1.74-3.38, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is associated with increased odds of major post-operative complication, discharge to destination other than home, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality.",

We extracted data from 23 peer-reviewed studies. Prevalence of torture, variably defined, was above 30% across all studies. Torture history in clinic populations correlated with hunger and posttraumatic stress disorder, although in small, nonrepresentative samples. One study observed that previous exposure to interpersonal violence interacted with longer immigration detention periods, resulting in higher depression scores. Limited evidence suggests that asylum seekers frequently experience violence and health problems, but large-scale studies are needed to inform policies and services for this vulnerable group often at the center of political debate.",
      "# Title: Sexual and reproductive health of migrants: does the EU care?\n# Abstract: The European Union (EU) refers to health as a human right in many internal and external communications, policies and agreements, defending its universality. In parallel, specific health needs of migrants originating from outside the EU have been acknowledged. Yet, their right to health and in particular sexual and reproductive health (SRH) is currently not ensured throughout the EU. This paper reflects on the results of a comprehensive literature review on migrants' SRH in the EU applying the Critical Interpretive Synthesis review method. We highlight the discrepancy between a proclaimed rights-based approach to health and actual obstacles to migrants' attainment of good SRH. Uncertainties on entitlements of diverse migrant groups are fuelled by unclear legal provisions, creating significant barriers to access health systems in general and SRH services in particular. Furthermore, the rare strategies addressing migrants' health fail to address sexual health and are generally limited to perinatal care and HIV screening. Thus, future European public health policy-making should not only strongly encourage its Member States to ensure equal access to health care for migrants as for EU citizens, but also promote migrants' SRH effectively through a holistic and inclusive approach in SRH policies, prevention and care.",
      "# Title: Evaluating the impact of immigration policies on health status among undocumented immigrants: a systematic review.\n# Abstract: Over the past two decades, new anti-immigration policies and laws have emerged to address the migration of undocumented immigrants. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to assess and understand how these immigration policies and laws may affect both access to health services and health outcomes among undocumented immigrants. Eight databases were used to conduct this review, which returned 325 papers that were assessed for validity based on specified inclusion criteria. Forty critically appraised articles were selected for analysis; thirty articles related to access to health services, and ten related to health outcomes. The articles showed a direct relationship between anti-immigration policies and their effects on access to health services. In addition, as a result of these policies, undocumented immigrants were impacted by mental health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Action items were presented, including the promotion of cultural diversity training and the development of innovative strategies to support safety-net health care facilities serving vulnerable populations.",

      "# Title: Barriers and Facilitators to HIV Testing in Migrants in High-Income Countries: A Systematic Review.\n# Abstract: Migrants, particularly from low- and middle-income countries, are at a heightened risk of adverse HIV outcomes. HIV testing may improve these outcomes. We reviewed and synthesised studies into migrants and HIV testing (outcome variable), published between January 1997 and April 2014. Papers using quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods designs, and samples with adult (≥18 years) migrants from low- and middle-income countries in high-income countries were included in the paper. Of 3155 papers retrieved, 31 met the inclusion criteria and are included in the review. A large number of barriers and facilitators to HIV testing were identified across the individual, social and structural levels. A number of study design and methodological issues, however, inhibited a comprehensive synthesis. There is no doubt that addressing HIV testing in migrants in high-income countries is complex; however, it has important implications for individual, community and population health, and a strong, empirically based response is warranted.",

      "# Title: What the eye does not see: a critical interpretive synthesis of European Union policies addressing sexual violence in vulnerable migrants.\n# Abstract: In Europe, refugees, asylum seekers and undocumented migrants are more vulnerable to sexual victimisation than European citizens. They face more challenges when seeking care. This literature review examines how legal and policy frameworks at national, European and international levels condition the prevention of and response to sexual violence affecting these vulnerable migrant communities living in the European Union (EU). Applying the Critical Interpretive Synthesis method, we reviewed 187 legal and policy documents and 80 peer-reviewed articles on migrant sexual health for elements on sexual violence and further analysed the 37 legal and 12 peer-reviewed articles among them that specifically focused on sexual violence in vulnerable migrants in the EU-27 States. Legal and policy documents dealing with sexual violence, particularly but not exclusively in vulnerable migrants, apply 'tunnel vision'. They ignore: a) frequently occurring types of sexual violence, b) victimisation rates across genders and c) specific risk factors within the EU such as migrants' legal status, gender orientation and living conditions. The current EU policy-making paradigm relegates sexual violence in vulnerable migrants as an 'outsider' and 'female only' issue while EU migration and asylum policies reinforce its invisibility. Effective response must be guided by participatory rights- and evidence-based policies and a public health approach, acknowledging the occurrence and multiplicity of sexual victimisation of vulnerable migrants of all genders within EU borders.",
      "# Title: Human Trafficking in Ethiopia: A Scoping Review to Identify Gaps in Service Delivery, Research, and Policy.\n# Abstract: The purpose of this review is to integrate evidence on human trafficking in Ethiopia and identify gaps and recommendations for service delivery, research and training, and policy. A scoping literature review approach was used to systematically search nursing, medical, psychological, law, and international databases and synthesize information on a complex, understudied topic. The search yielded 826 articles, and 39 met the predetermined criteria for inclusion in the review. Trafficking in Ethiopia has occurred internally and externally in the form of adult and child labor and sex trafficking. There were also some reports of organ trafficking and other closely related human rights violations, such as child marriage, child soldiering, and exploitative intercountry adoption. Risk factors for trafficking included push factors (poverty, political instability, economic problems, and gender discrimination) and pull factors (demand for cheap labor). Trafficking was associated with poor health and economic outcomes for victims. Key recommendations for service delivery, research and training, and policy are identified, including establishing comprehensive services for survivor rehabilitation and reintegration, conducting quantitative health outcomes research, and reforming policy around migration and trafficking. Implementing the recommendations identified by this review will allow policy makers, researchers, and practitioners to take meaningful steps toward confronting human trafficking in Ethiopia.",

      "# Title: Factors Influencing the Accuracy of Infectious Disease Reporting in Migrants: A Scoping Review.\n# Abstract: We conducted a scoping review of literature to improve our understanding of the accuracy of infectious disease monitoring in migrants in the Europe. We searched PubMed for papers relevant to the topic including: case reports, observational and experimental studies, reviews, guidelines or policy documents; published after 1994. We identified 532 papers, 27 of which were included in the review. Legislation and right to access health care influence both the accuracy of rates and risk measures under estimating the at risk population, i.e., the denominator. Furthermore, the number of reported cases, i.e., the numerator, may also include cases not accounted for in the denominator. Both biases lead to an overestimated disease occurrence. Restriction to healthcare access and low responsiveness may cause under-detection of cases, however a quantification of this phenomenon has not been produced. On the contrary, screening for asymptomatic diseases increases ascertainment leading to increased detection of cases. Incompleteness of denominator data underestimates the at-risk population. In conclusion, most studies show a lower probability of under-reporting infectious diseases in migrants compared with native populations."

The objective of our study was to evaluate the prognostic role of baseline NLR and change in NLR (ΔNLR) in advanced pancreatic cancer underwent chemotherapy. Between January 2010 and June 2015, 132 patients underwent chemotherapy were eligible for assessment. Based on our patients' data, the cut-off value of NLR was 2.78 according to receiver operating characteristic curve. We observed that a high level of baseline NLR (NLR > 2.78) was a poor prognostic factor for overall survival (multivariable hazard ratio [HR] = 2.648, P < 0.001). Increased NLR (ΔNLR > 0) after 2 cycles of chemotherapy was associated with higher risk compared to ΔNLR ≤ 0 (multivariable HR = 1.894, P = 0.007). Combining both NLR and ΔNLR factors, multivariate analysis showed a significant higher risk (HR = 5.817, P < 0.001) for patients with high baseline NLR and increased NLR after 2 cycles of chemotherapy compared to patients with low baseline NLR and ΔNLR ≤ 0.

A total of 80 patients with acute cerebral infarction who were treated at our hospital were randomly selected. They were divided into groups A and B. The two groups were treated with intravenous thrombolysis, while group B received sub-hypothermia treatment. Prior to treatment and at 7 days after treatment, 5 ml of venous blood was collected and stored in a freezer at -80˚C. IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 levels were detected by ELISA and compared between the groups and time-points. The results were as follows: i) At 7 days after treatment, the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in group B were significantly decreased compared with those in group A (P<0.05), while there was no significant difference of these levels between group A and B before treatment (P>0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions in group A and group B was 35 and 20% respectively, and the mortality rate was 10 and 5%, respectively. There were no significant differences in adverse events and mortality between the two groups (P>0.05). In addition, a positive correlation of the level of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was determined in the patients prior to treatment. In conclusion, mild hypothermia treatment in addition to intravenous thrombolysis significantly reduced the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in patients with acute cerebral infarction and reduced inflammation, and should therefore be incorporated in clinical practice.",

Consecutive adult NAFLD patients who had a liver biopsy were included. Serum WFA+-M2BP level was measured using a lectin-antibody sandwich immunoassay using a chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay machine (HISCL-5000, Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). The measured levels were indexed using the following equation: Cut-off index (COI) = ([WFA+-M2BP]sample-[WFA+-M2BP]NC) / ([WFA+-M2BP]PC-[WFA+-M2BP]NC), where PC = positive control and NC = negative control. Histopathological examination of liver biopsy specimen was reported according to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Clinical Research Network Scoring System. Data for 220 cases were analyzed.

The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of fibrosis stage ≥1, ≥2, ≥3 and 4 was 0.61, 0.71, 0.74 and 0.84, respectively. Out of the 220 cases, 152 cases were the same 76 patients who had a repeat liver biopsy after 48 weeks of intervention. The AUROC of the change in the COI to detect improvement in steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning and fibrosis was 0.57, 0.54, 0.59 and 0.52, respectively. In conclusion, serum WFA+-M2BP was most useful for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in NAFLD patients. However, it was less useful for differentiating NASH from non-NASH, and for diagnosis and follow-up of the individual histopathological components of NASH.",

We assessed its efficacy in evaluating liver disease severity in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in Taiwan. The association between WFA+-M2BP and histological features was evaluated among those CHC patients underwent liver biopsy. We also aimed to clarify the factors determining the performance of WFA+-M2BP in CHC. A total of 229 CHC patients were consecutively recruited. The mean value of WFA+-M2BP in patients from F0 to F4 was 1.68, 2.23, 3.45, 3.48, 3.77 respectively (linear trend P = 0.008). Linear regression analysis revealed that alanine aminotransferase (odds ratio [OR]: 0.03, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.02-0.05, P < 0.001), AST (OR: -0.1, 95% CI: -0.02 to -0.01, P < 0.001), and liver fibrosis (OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.01-0.59, P = 0.043) were the independent factors correlated to serum WFA+-M2BP level. The optimal cutoff values of WFA+-M2BP for fibrosis stages F1, F2, F3, and F4 were 1.42, 1.61, 1.42, and 2.67, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the platelet count (OR/CI: -0.009/0.986-0.996, P = <0.001), r-glutamyl transferase (OR/CI: 0.007/1.000-1.013, P = 0.036), and WFA+-M2BP (OR/CI: 0.187/1.057-1.374, P = 0.005). We concluded that WFA+-M2BP is a competent noninvasive marker for liver fibrosis assessment in CHC patients.",

      "# Title: Comparison of serum fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B.\n# Abstract: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The diagnosis of liver fibrosis has a key role in selecting patients with CHB for antiviral treatment. However, serum biomarkers demonstrate limited diagnostic utility. The present study aimed to compare the performances of fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB and to identify the most appropriate biomarker for these patients. The current study included 96 antiviral-naïve patients with CHB who underwent liver biopsy. METAVIR scoring system was used to assess liver fibrosis and necroinflammation. The diagnostic performances were evaluated of the platelet (PLT) count; the levels of hyaluronan, serum 7S domain of type 4 collagen, procollagen type III N-terminal peptide, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1, Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) and N-terminal type III collagen propeptide (Pro-C3); the fibrosis index based on four factors; the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index; and enhanced liver fibrosis score for identifying significant liver fibrosis [≥fibrosis stage 2 (F2)]. All fibrosis biomarkers, except the Pro-C3 level, correlated with the fibrosis stage. M2BPGi was better than other biomarkers for diagnosing ≥F2, with the highest area under the curve of 0.902. M2BPGi demonstrated a higher diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis than mild/severe fibrosis or cirrhosis. However, no significant correlation was observed between the M2BPGi level and fibrosis stage in patients with CHB having significant liver necroinflammation defined as ≥ necroinflammatory activity 2. The M2BPGi level and PLT count were exclusively correlated with the fibrosis stage in 73 patients without significant liver necroinflammation. M2BPGi demonstrated the highest diagnostic performance for significant fibrosis in patients having significant liver fibrosis with no significant liver necroinflammation. In conclusion, the M2BPGi level can accurately diagnose significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB.",

This study evaluated the performance of WFA+ -M2BP in predicting fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. A total of 80 patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) were enrolled. Serum WFA+ -M2BP levels were measured using standard methods. The fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index was also measured. The mean values of WFA+ -M2BP were 1.0, 1.0, 0.8, and 2.2 in Metavir fibrosis stage F0, F1, F2, and F3-4, respectively (linear trend p = 0.005). The optimal cut-off value of WFA+ -M2BP in predicting advanced fibrosis (F3-4) was 1.37 cut-off index (COI), yielding the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, and accuracy of 75.0, 79.4, 39.1, 94.7, and 78.7%, respectively (p < 0.001). Combining WFA+ -M2BP with FIB-4 significantly increased the diagnostic performance for advanced fibrosis, yielding specificity, PPV, and accuracy of 100, 100, and 93%, respectively. The significant factors predicting advanced liver fibrosis in the multivariate regression analysis were WFA+ -M2BP ≥ 1.37 COI (OR/confidence interval [CI]: 9.49/1.63-55.21, p = 0.01) and FIB-4 ≥ 2.80 (OR/CI: 38.18/4.89-297.93, p = 0.001).

      "# Title: The modified frailty index and 30-day adverse events in oncologic neurosurgery.\n# Abstract: The modified frailty index (mFI) is emerging as a leading measure for preoperative risk assessment using routinely available medical record data. Our objective was to determine if mFI predicts morbidity and mortality in the diverse national cohort of patients undergoing neurosurgery for intracranial neoplasms. We identified patients in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program who underwent oncologic neurosurgery procedures between 2008 and 2012. The mFI, ranging from 0 to 1, was calculated as the proportion of 11 possible risk factors present. We assessed the associations between mFI and 30-day mortality, neurologic and medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge in univariate and multivariable analyses and compare the index to established risk stratification techniques. A total of 9149 patients were identified. Mortality, severe medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge increased incrementally with increasing levels of frailty. Severe neurologic complications were highest in those with low frailty. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, increased frailty increased the odds of all adverse outcomes, including neurologic complications. The mFI increased the ability to predict all outcomes beyond available indices and was the most reliable predictor of neurologic complications. The mFI can be calculated from routinely collected medical record data and is predictive of 30-day adverse outcomes in a wide variety of neurosurgical oncology patients. The index may be a useful component of preoperative risk assessment with implications for shared decision-making, perioperative planning, and risk adjusted outcomes measurement in national quality registries.",

Few data exist regarding the relationship of frailty with adverse outcomes in craniotomy for brain tumor resection. We assessed the relationship between frailty and the incidence of major post-operative complication, discharge destination other than home, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality after elective craniotomy for brain tumor resection. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 20,333 adult patients undergoing elective craniotomy for tumor resection in the 2012-2018 ACS-NSQIP Participant Use File. Multivariate logistic regression was performed using all covariates deemed eligible through clinical and statistical significance. 6,249 patients (30.7%) were low-frailty and 2,148 patients (10.6%) were medium-to-high frailty. In multivariate logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, BMI, ASA classification, smoking status, dyspnea, significant pre-operative weight loss, chronic steroid use, bleeding disorder, tumor type, and operative time, low frailty was associated with increased adjusted odds ratio of major complication (1.41, 95% CI: 1.23-1.60, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.32, 95% CI: 1.20-1.46, p < 0.001), 30-day readmission (1.29, 95% CI: 1.15-1.44, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (1.87, 95% CI: 1.41-2.47, p < 0.001). Moderate-to-high frailty was also associated with increased adjusted odds of major complication (1.61, 95% CI: 1.35-1.92, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.80, 95% CI: 1.58-2.05), 30-day readmission (1.39, 95% CI: 1.19-1.62, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (2.42, 95% CI: 1.74-3.38, p < 0.001).

The current study analyzed the clinical significance of this new stage in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Subjects and Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 4045 eligible PTC patients. The patients were divided into four groups according to the extent of ETE: no ETE, ETE into perithyroidal tissue, T3b (ETE into the strap muscles), and ETE beyond the strap muscles. Differences in the clinical characteristics and prognosis of the four groups were assessed. Results: Of these 4045 patients, 2300 (56.9%) had no ETE, 1004 (24.8%) had ETE into perithyroidal tissue, 371 (9.2%) had ETE into the strap muscles, and 370 (9.1%) had ETE beyond the strap muscles. Tumor size, multifocality, lymph node metastasis (LNM), distant metastasis (DM), recurrence, and recurrence-free survival (RFS) between patients with ETE into perithyroidal tissue and patients without ETE did not show differences, but significant differences were observed between patients with T3b and patients without ETE, and only patients with ETE beyond the strap muscles had significantly worse overall survival (OS) than the other three groups. However, T3b did not independently predict worse RFS in univariable and multivariable analyses. Conclusions: T3b, distinguished from minimal ETE, may be related to larger tumor size, higher prevalence of multifocality, LNM, DM, recurrence, and worse RFS than no ETE, but it may not affect OS and may not independently predict recurrence in PTC patients.",
      "# Title: Is There a Difference Between Minimal and Gross Extension into the Strap Muscles for the Risk of Recurrence in Papillary Thyroid Carcinomas?\n# Abstract: Background: The morbidity of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is primarily related to locoregional recurrences and distant metastases. The definition of minimal extrathyroidal extension (mETE) has been recently revised. The presence of mETE does not impact mortality and is generally not considered to be a predictor for the risk of recurrence. This study aimed at comparing the risk of recurrence and the response to therapy of PTC with mETE and gross extrathyroidal extension (ETE) into the strap muscles (gETE) with low- and intermediate-risk PTC without ETE (low risk w/o ETE and intermediate risk w/o ETE, respectively) to further characterize the impact of ETE on outcomes. Methods: A total of 596 PTCs were analyzed according to the degree of ETE as well as other predictors of recurrence. Four groups of patients were compared, low risk w/o ETE (n = 251), intermediate risk w/o ETE (n = 89), mETE (n = 191), and gETE (n = 65), to determine the risk of recurrence and the response to treatment. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate associations between groups and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: The risk of recurrence was 3% in low risk w/o ETE PTC, 14% in intermediate risk w/o ETE, 14% in mETE, and 25% in gETE. The recurrence risk was increased by the presence of ETE (odds ratio [OR] = 2.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-5.85, p = 0.005) and lymph node metastases (OR = 2.44 [95% CI 1.25-4.76], p = 0.009). Patients with low-risk carcinomas w/o ETE experienced longer DFS than those with mETE (hazard ratio = 0.08 [95% CI 0.02-0.28], p < 0.001), but no significant difference was observed between intermediate risk w/o ETE, mETE, and gETE. In terms of the response to therapy, patients with gETE had higher rates of biochemical and/or structural incomplete responses within the first year of treatment (OR = 2.68 [95% CI 1.31-5.45], p = 0.007) and at the final follow-up evaluation (OR = 4.35 [95% CI 1.99-9.51], p < 0.001) compared with those with mETE. An analysis of the subgroups of microcarcinomas without lymph node metastases revealed no significant difference in DFS or the response to therapy between the low risk w/o ETE and mETE PTC groups. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that both mETE and gETE are independent risk factors for the risk of recurrence in PTC. Although gETE has a more pronounced impact on the recurrence risk and is associated with a worse response to therapy, mETE may not be associated with a low risk of recurrence. This observation suggests that patients with PTC and mETE may, in part, have an intermediate risk of recurrence and need to be followed accordingly."

A retrospective study of 103 patients.\n# Abstract: A retrospective study of 103 patients with essential thrombocythemia was carried out to evaluate the incidence of thrombohemorrhagic complications and establish whether there were any correlations between these events and clinical or laboratory data. At onset or during the course of the disease, 26 patients (25.2%) presented thrombotic and 12 (11.6%) hemorrhagic complications: among the latter, six patients had gastrointestinal bleeding during antiaggregant therapy. No significant correlations were observed between thrombohemorrhagic complications and platelet count, age, sex, platelet function, bleeding time, or therapeutic regimen. However, there was a statistically significant correlation between a positive patient history for thrombotic events and an increase in thromboses. In agreement with other authors, it is believed that the best approach in asymptomatic patients is strict surveillance without treatment. Chemotherapy and/or treatment with antiaggregant agents should be reserved for symptomatic patients or patients with a positive history for thrombotic events.",
      "# Title: Clinical course of essential thrombocythemia in 147 cases.\n# Abstract: The authors retrospectively analyzed the initial characteristics, treatment, and clinical course in 147 patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET). Median age was 60 years and the M:F ratio was 0.69. At diagnosis, 53 patients were asymptomatic; 50 patients had functional symptoms (mainly vasomotor disturbances); 27 patients had large vessel thrombosis; 27 patients had a bleeding diathesis; and seven patients had both bleeding and thrombosis. The platelet count ranged from 0.7 to 2.92 X 10(12)/l. Forty-five of the 61 tested patients (61%) had prolonged bleeding time and/or platelet hypoaggregation. Three patients had in vitro spontaneous aggregation. No significant correlations were found between hemostatic findings and in vivo bleeding or thrombosis. The incidence of bleeding, however, was higher in patients with more than 2 x 10(12)/l platelets. Of 87 karyotypes performed with banding techniques, only four were abnormal. One hundred twenty-nine patients received one or more cytoreductive agents at diagnosis or during follow-up. Sixty patients received an antiaggregating agent. First-line therapy was radiophosphorus (32P) in 22 patients; busulfan in 35 patients; and hydroxyurea in 72 patients. Hydroxyurea required continuous maintenance therapy and had to be changed to another treatment in 12 of the initial responders because of inadequate control of thrombocythemia. During follow-up, 14 treated patients experienced one or several major thrombotic events. Two untreated patients also had major thrombosis. Only one major bleeding event was seen during follow-up. Median actuarial survival was 73.5% at 7 years and only one patient progressed to acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). These results suggest that large vessel thrombosis is the main complication of ET. It appears largely unpredictable in a given patient at diagnosis but can be largely prevented by the control of thrombocythemia. Because of the low incidence of side effects of treatment in this experience, the authors believe that cytoreductive therapy is indicated in most patients with ET, as long as a group of patients with very low risk of thrombosis is not defined in prospective studies.",

Seventy-seven patients had vascular risk factors, and 37 a history of MVC at ET diagnosis. Forty-nine MVC were registered in 33 patients during the follow-up period. The actuarial probability of MVC was 27% at 6 years in the whole series, 35.6% for patients above 60 years, and 21.4% for patients younger than 60 years, whereas only one of the 36 patients younger than 45 years had MVC. At multivariate analysis, age >60 years, history of major ischemia and hypercholesterolemia were the variables associated with an increased MVC risk.

Thirty-nine patients had at least one abnormal result indicating platelet hyperactivity (i.e. impedance or release with one agonist being above the reference range); 16 patients had platelet hypoactivity (i.e. at least one result was below the reference range), whilst 14 had co-existence of hyper- and hypoactivity. Six patients had normal results. 20/53 patients with platelet hyperactivity (alone or mixed) had a positive history of venous and/or arterial thrombosis; in comparison, only two of the other 22 patients had a positive history. During a median follow-up of 33 months, nine patients with and one patient without platelet hyperactivity respectively developed new thrombotic events before the addition of specific therapy. A total of 50 patients with and eight patients without platelet hyperactivity respectively received specific treatment including aspirin and/or cytotoxic therapy. All but one elderly patient with platelet hyperactivity have remained free of new thrombotic events on specific therapy. Two of the 17 patients with platelet hypoactivity had major clinical bleeding. These observations highlight the need to test platelets for hyper- as well as hypo-function and suggest a useful role for routine whole blood platelet aggregation studies to identify the patients at risk for thrombosis or bleeding.",
      "# Title: Incidence, clinical features and outcome of essential thrombocythaemia in a well defined geographical area.\n# Abstract: In an attempt to characterise the clinical features, incidence and outcome of essential thrombocythaemia (ET) we report our experience in a large unselected series of patients from a well defined region. All new cases of ET in the County of Copenhagen were registered during the period 1977-98. We identified 96 cases of ET, yielding an age- and sex-adjusted annual incidence rate of 0.59/100.000 and a point-prevalence at last follow up of 11/100.000. The overall incidence rate was 0.31 and 1.00 per 100.000 population during the consecutive periods 1977-89 and 1990-98, respectively, corresponding to a 3.2-fold increase. Median age at diagnosis was 67 yr (females 68 yr, males 66 yr, range 18-87 yr), and the female to male (F/M) ratio was 2.6:1. At diagnosis, 52% of the patients displayed no ET-related symptoms and were discovered fortuitously by a routine platelet count. Forty-eight percent presented with thrombohaemorrhagic phenomena, of which microvascular disturbances of the central nervous system (CNS), extremities and skin were most frequently observed (23%). Compared to patients diagnosed after 1989, patients diagnosed before 1990 had a significantly higher mean platelet count, white blood cell (WBC) count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) value and alkaline phosphatase value. With a median follow up of 70 months, 5-yr survival was 76%, significantly lower than the expected survival of an age- and sex-matched control group (p = 0.0052). Thirty-seven patients experienced a total of 55 thrombohaemorrhagic events during follow-up, corresponding to an incidence of thrombosis and microvascular disturbances or haemorrhage of 8.1% per pt-yr and 2.5% per pt-yr, respectively. The number of patients experiencing thrombosis or microvascular disturbances was significantly higher among the 29 patients who never received acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) compared to the 67 patients who received ASA during follow up (45% vs. 21%; p = 0.017). This study provides population-based data suggesting the benefit of treatment with low-dose ASA in a non-selected population of patients with ET.",

      "# Title: Frequency and risk factors for thrombosis in idiopathic myelofibrosis: analysis in a series of 155 patients from a single institution.\n# Abstract: Thrombosis is a frequent complication of polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia, but its incidence and predisposing factors in idiopathic myelofibrosis (IM) are unknown. In 18 (11.6%) of 155 patients diagnosed with IM in a single institution, 31 thrombotic events (19 arterial, 12 venous) were registered after a mean follow-up of 4.2 (s.d.: 4.5) years. In six patients, the thrombosis was simultaneous to or appeared a few months before IM diagnosis and 14 had one or more thrombotic episodes. When compared with the general population, a significant increase was observed in the incidence of venous thrombosis (odds ratio 17.5, 95% confidence interval: 10.3-31.4). At multivariate analysis, the initial variables associated with an increased risk of thrombosis were thrombocytosis (platelets >450 x 10(9)/l, P=0.001), presence of one cardiovascular risk factor (arterial hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes, P=0.003), cellular phase of myelofibrosis (P=0.005), and Hb >11 g/dl (P=0.02). Considering post-diagnosis events, the 5-year thrombosis-free survival probability was 90.4% in the series, 80.6% for patients with platelets >450 x 10(9)/l, 82.6% for patients with one cardiovascular risk factor, and 85.1% for those in cellular phase. These results indicate an increased thrombotic risk for IM patients with hyperproliferative features and/or coexistent cardiovascular risk factors.",

      "# Title: Leukocytosis is a risk factor for thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia: interaction with treatment, standard risk factors, and Jak2 mutation status.\n# Abstract: Leukocytes contribute to the pathogenesis of thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia (ET) through recently discovered mechanisms of activation and interaction with platelets and endothelial cells. To evaluate whether an increased leukocyte count was associated with thrombosis and whether this effect can be modulated by therapy, we analyzed the clinical course of 439 patients with ET followed at the Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo. The strength of the association was measured at diagnosis or before thrombotic events by multivariable analyses carried out using data at baseline as well as time-varying covariates. The results showed that (1) an increased leukocyte count at diagnosis was associated with thrombosis during follow-up (\"baseline analysis,\" relative risk [RR] 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-3.9, P = .001); (2) hydroxyurea (HU) lowered leukocytosis and reduced the strength of the association between leukocytosis and thrombosis (\"time-dependent analysis,\" RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.9-2.0, not significant [NS]); (3) the association of leukocytosis and thrombosis was more evident in untreated low-risk patients (RR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-6.4, P = .01) compared with HU-treated high-risk patients (RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.8-3.2, NS); and (4) the presence of JAK2 V617F was not identified as a risk factor for thrombosis during follow-up despite a significant association between the mutation and leukocytosis. We suggest validation of these findings in prospective clinical studies.",
      "# Title: Clinical profile of homozygous JAK2 617V>F mutation in patients with polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia.\n# Abstract: JAK2 617V>F mutation occurs in a homozygous state in 25% to 30% of patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and 2% to 4% with essential thrombocythemia (ET). Whether homozygosity associates with distinct clinical phenotypes is still under debate. This retrospective multicenter study considered 118 JAK2 617V>F homozygous patients (104 PV, 14 ET) whose clinical characteristics were compared with those of 587 heterozygous and 257 wild-type patients. Irrespective of their clinical diagnosis, homozygous patients were older, displayed a higher leukocyte count and hematocrit value at diagnosis, and presented larger spleen volume. Aquagenic pruritus was significantly more common among homozygous PV patients. JAK2 617V>F homozygosity associated with more frequent evolution into secondary myelofibrosis in both PV and ET. After adjustment for sex, age, leukocyte count, and previous thrombosis in a multivariate analysis, homozygous ET patients displayed a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio [HR] 3.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-11.7; P = .013) than wild-type (HR = 1.0) or heterozygous patients (HR = 1.49). No significant association of JAK2 617V>F homozygosity with thrombosis risk was observed in PV. Finally, JAK2 617V>F homozygous patients were more likely to receive chemotherapy for control of disease. We conclude that JAK2 617V>F homozygosity identifies PV or ET patients with a more symptomatic myeloproliferative disorder and is associated with a higher risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with ET.",
      "# Title: Vascular events in Korean patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and their relationship to JAK2 mutation.\n# Abstract: Evaluation of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F mutation has been widely used for the diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). However, its prognostic relevance to clinical outcome is not completely understood. We investigated the association of JAK2 V617F with vascular events in Korean patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). We studied 283 patients from 15 centers, who were diagnosed with MPN. The JAK2 V617F status was evaluated by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. The patients' diagnoses were essential thrombocythemia (ET n = 146), polycythemia vera (PV n = 120), primary myelofibrosis (n = 12), and unclassifiable MPN (MPNu n = 5). JAK2 V617F was detected in 89 (61%) patients with ET, 103 (86%) with PV, four (33%) with myelofibrosis, and four (80%) with MPNu. A higher number of leukocytes, haemoglobin levels and BM cellularity as well as an older age, lower platelet counts, and diagnosis of PV were significantly correlated with JAK2 V617F. Eighty-three and 43 episodes of thrombosis and bleeding occurred in 100 patients each before and after the diagnosis. Vascular events more frequently occurred in 37% of patients with JAK2 V617F than in 29% of those without the mutation (p = 0.045). Among 175 patients whose samples were available for sequencing, 28 patients with homozygous JAK2 V617F had vascular events more frequently (57%) than those who were heterozygotes (39%) or had the wild type (27%) (p = 0.03). The multivariate analysis showed that a JAK2 homozygous mutation, hypercholesterolemia and older age were independent risk factors for a vascular event. The results of this study showed that Korean patients with MPN had a similar JAK2 mutation rate and frequency of vascular events when compared to Western patients. The presence of V617F was significantly related to vascular events. Therefore, initial evaluation for the JAK2 mutation and careful monitoring for vascular events should be performed in MPN patients.",
      "# Title: Thrombosis in primary myelofibrosis: incidence and risk factors.\n# Abstract: We assessed frequency and predictive factors for major cardiovascular (CV) events in 707 patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) followed in 4 European institutions. A total of 236 deaths (33%) were recorded for an overall mortality of 7.7% patient-years (pt-yr). Fatal and nonfatal thromboses were registered in 51 (7.2%) patients, with a rate of 1.75% pt-yr. If deaths from non-CV causes were considered as competing events, we estimated that the adjusted rate of major thrombotic events would have been 2.2% pt-yr. In a multivariable model, age older than 60 years (hazard ratio [HR], 2.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-4.39, P = .01) and JAK2 mutational status (HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.10-3.34; P = .02) were significantly associated with thrombosis, whereas the strength of the association between leukocyte count higher than 15 x 10(9)/L and CV events was of borderline significance (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 0.97-2.72; P = .06). The highest incidence of fatal and nonfatal thrombosis was observed when the mutation was present along with leukocytosis (3.9% pt-yr; HR, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.26-7.81). This study is the largest hitherto carried out in this setting and shows that the rate of major CV events in PMF is comparable with that reported in essential thrombocythemia, and it is increased in aged patients and those with JAK2 V617F mutation and leukocytosis.",
      "# Title: Thrombosis in myelofibrosis: prior thrombosis is the only predictive factor and most venous events are provoked.\n# Abstract: In a retrospective analysis of 205 patients (median age 62 years) with primary myelofibrosis and known JAK2V617F mutational status, 13.2% experienced a vaso-occlusive event at or prior to their diagnosis. After a median follow up of 31 months, post-diagnosis thrombosis occurred in 22 patients (10.7%), including 9 (4.4%) and 16 (7.8%) patients with a total of 9 arterial and 24 venous events, respectively. The majority (71%) of the venous events were temporally associated with other exogenous risk factors for thrombosis such as surgery, line placement or hormonal therapy. On multivariable analysis that included age, JAK2V617F mutation status and leukocyte count as covariates, history of thrombosis was the only predictive variable in general (P=0.04) or when arterial (P=0.007) and venous (P=0.02) thromboses were analyzed separately. The current study demonstrates a higher prevalence of venous, as opposed to arterial, events in PMF, post-diagnosis, and clarifies their nature as being mostly provoked.",
      "# Title: Impact of leukocytosis on thrombotic risk and survival in 532 patients with essential thrombocythemia: a retrospective study.\n# Abstract: Established risk factors for thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia (ET) include age (≥ 60 years) and previous vascular events. Recently, also leukocytosis has been proposed in risk stratification of ET patients. We report a retrospective study on 532 ET patients followed for a median of 7.6 years. Sixty-four patients (12%) developed 95 thrombotic events during follow-up. Together with the high-risk condition, a white blood cell (WBC) value above 11 × 10⁹/L, corresponding to the fourth percentile value, significantly correlated with a higher thrombotic risk (p = 0.033) by Cox proportional hazards. Moreover, the cumulative risk of thrombosis was significantly higher in high-risk patients with WBC >11 × 10⁹/L. JAK2 V617F mutation did not correlate with thrombosis. Overall, 123 (23%) patients died. Three independent parameters were noted as prognostic factors for survival in multivariate analysis: age > 60 years, leukocytosis >11 × 10⁹/L, and hemoglobin level below normal values. Based on these parameters, three groups of risk were defined, with significantly different survivals. Baseline leukocytosis correlated with a higher thrombotic risk in high-risk patients and identified a cohort of patients with worse survival.",
      "# Title: Incidence and risk factors for bleeding in 1104 patients with essential thrombocythemia or prefibrotic myelofibrosis diagnosed according to the 2008 WHO criteria.\n# Abstract: In an international study of 1104 patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET), a histological review according to the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria confirmed ET in 891 patients (WHO-ET, 81%), and revised the diagnosis to prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis (PMF) in 180 patients (PMF, 16%). Major bleeding during follow-up occurred in 55 (6%) WHO-ET and 21 (12%) PMF patients (P = 0.009), at a rate of 0.79 and 1.39% patients per year, respectively, (P = 0.039). In a multivariable analysis, predictors of bleeding included diagnosis of PMF (P = 0.05; hazard ratio (HR) 1.74), leukocytosis (P = 0.04; HR 1.74), previous hemorrhage (P = 0.025; HR 2.35) and aspirin therapy (P=0.001; HR 3.16). The analysis restricted to patients with WHO-ET confirmed previous hemorrhage (P = 0.043; HR 1.92) and aspirin (P=0.027; HR 2.24) as independent risk factors. The current study reveals that major bleeding associated with thrombocytosis might be relatively specific to PMF, as opposed to WHO-defined ET. Furthermore, it shows that low-dose aspirin exacerbates these hemorrhagic events of PMF. In contrast, thrombocytosis per se was not a risk factor for bleeding; however, low-dose aspirin had a synergistic hemorrhagic effect unmasking the bleeding tendency of patients with extreme thrombocytosis. These observations carry significant therapeutic implications in these two WHO entities.",
      "# Title: Leukocytosis as an important risk factor for arterial thrombosis in WHO-defined early/prefibrotic myelofibrosis: an international study of 264 patients.\n# Abstract: We aimed to determine risk factors for thrombotic events in early/prefibrotic myelofibrosis diagnosed according to the World Health Organization criteria. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was calculated on a total number of 264 patients derived from an international database. After a median follow-up of 6.28 years, 42 (15.9%) patients experienced arterial (n = 31) or venous thrombosis (n = 11). A higher leukocyte count correlated with an increased risk for total thrombosis and in particular, with an increased risk for arterial thrombosis (P = 0.005, HR 1.15 and P = 0.047, HR 1.12, respectively). A platelet count above 870 × 10⁹/L was associated with a lower risk for total thrombosis and also for venous thrombosis (P = 0.022, HR 0.44 and P = 0.027, HR 0.19). Moreover, a lower hemoglobin level was associated with an increased risk for venous thrombosis (P = 0.007, HR 0.59). Our data indicate that leukocytosis is a prominent risk factor for thrombosis in early/prefibrotic MF.",

      "# Title: Thromboses and hemorrhages are common in MPN patients with high JAK2V617F allele burden.\n# Abstract: The most common causes of morbidity and mortality in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications. The JAK2V617F mutation, commonly found in MPN, correlates with several clinical and laboratory characteristics even if the relevance of JAK2V617F allele burden in the natural history of these diseases is unclear. In this study we searched, a relation between thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications and JAK2V617F allele burden level in MPN patients. We evaluated 253 consecutive MPN [121 essential thrombocythemia (ET), 124 polycythemia vera (PV), and 8 primary myelofibrosis (PMF)] patients in whom the JAK2V617F allele burden was available, all studied and followed (median 8.8 years) in our department. Patients were stratified accordingly to their JAK2V617F allele burden, into four quartiles (1st <25%, 2nd 26-50%, 3rd 51-75%, and 4th >75%). Significantly higher incidence of thromboses (p = 0.001) and hemorrhages (p < 0.001) during follow-up has been observed in higher quartiles when compared to lower ones. Thrombosis- and hemorrhage-free survivals were poorer in patients belonging to the highest quartile. Our data suggest that MPN patients with JAK2V617F allele burden higher than 75% have to be considered as high risk patients, being prone to develop thrombo-hemorrhagic complications during the disease course.",
      "# Title: Risk factors for arterial versus venous thrombosis in polycythemia vera: a single center experience in 587 patients.\n# Abstract: In a recent International Working Group on Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) study, prior arterial events and hypertension were predictors of subsequent arterial thrombosis whereas prior venous events and age ≥65 years predicted venous thrombosis in polycythemia vera (PV). In the current study, we sought to validate the above findings and identify additional predictors of arterial versus venous thrombosis. At a median follow up of 109 months, thrombosis after diagnosis occurred in 128 (22%) patients; 82 (14%) arterial and 57 (10%) venous events. On multivariate analysis, prior arterial events (<0.0001), hyperlipidemia (p = 0.03), and hypertension (p = 0.02) predicted subsequent arterial events. In comparison, prior venous events (p = 0.05), leukocytosis ≥11 × 109/L (p = 0.002), and major hemorrhage (p = 0.02) were predictors of subsequent venous events. Salient associations with arterial thrombosis included age ≥ 60 years, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and normal karyotype whereas age ≤ 60 years, females, palpable splenomegaly and history of major hemorrhage were associated with venous thrombosis. TET2 or ASXL1 mutations did not impact arterial nor venous thrombosis. In conclusion, we identify distinct associations for arterial versus venous thrombosis in PV and confirm that a prior arterial or venous thrombotic event is the most reliable predictor of subsequent events.",

Mutations in either the januskinase-2 (JAK-2) or the calreticulin (CALR) gene are characteristic for MPN and may result in enhanced proliferation of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets, and thus increase the risk for vascular events. This study is a retrospective and descriptive analysis of records of patients, who underwent treatment for myeloproliferative syndromes at the Department of Hemato-Oncology of the University hospital Krems from 2008 to the end of 2015. Out of 250 patients, who were suspected for MPN, 51 patients displayed a JAK-2 V617F mutation. These were analyzed with regard to their blood values, gender, age at diagnosis, therapy and vascular events before and after diagnosis (during therapy). Of the 51 patients diagnosed with MPN and a JAK-2 V617F mutation, 33 suffered from PV, 15 from ET and 3 from MF. More men than women were diagnosed with MPN and the median age at diagnosis was 72 years. Acetylsalicylic acid, phlebotomy and Hydroxyurea were the most frequent therapies applied. In our study cohort, the most common vascular events were acute coronary syndrome and transitory ischemic attack. Thromboembolic events were effectively reduced by MPN therapy while no elevation in bleeding events could be observed.",
      "# Title: Clinico-hematological profile and thrombotic/hemorrhagic events in 150 chinese patients with essential thrombocythemia.\n# Abstract: Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is an uncommon chronic myeloproliferative disorder with no cure. Patients with ET are at risk of different complications, and currently there are no optimal prognostic standards to predict severe post-diagnosis complications such as thrombosis and hemorrhage. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the full set of clinical data from 150 Chinese patients with ET enrolled from 2013 to 2016. We discovered that neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), along with other known clinical parameters such as age, leukocyte count, incidence of thrombotic events is higher in patients with JAK2 V617F mutation. NLR is also higher in patients at high-risk stratification of thrombosis. Multivariate analysis showed that age (P = 0.001, 95% CI 1.023-1.089) and JAK2 V617F mutation (P = 0.003, 95% CI 1.837-21.035) were independent factors for thrombotic events, while age (P = 0.005, 95% CI 1.019-1.111) was the only predictive factor for hemorrhagic events at diagnosis. For future thrombotic events, multivariate analysis revealed NLR as the best predictive parameter (P < 0.001, 95% CI 1.173-1.486) when compared with other clinical parameters such as age (P = 0.037, 95% CI 1.004-1.126), thrombosis at diagnosis (P = 0.036, 95% CI 1.077-9.099) and WBC count (P = 0.047, 95% CI 1.001-1.109). Further ROC curve and Kaplan Meier analysis validated NLR as better prognostic marker for future thrombotic events and thrombosis-free survival. In summary, our data suggest that NLR parameter may possess great prognostic significance for future thrombosis in ET patients."

      "conclusionA": "**Primary Concluding Statement:**\n\nAmong patients with Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), including essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), there is a significantly increased risk of both thrombosis and hemorrhage. Key risk factors identified across multiple studies include older age (particularly >60 years), history of prior vascular events (thrombotic or hemorrhagic), leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count), JAK2 V617F mutation status (especially homozygosity in ET), and specific disease characteristics like cellular phase in myelofibrosis or high platelet counts in ET. Low-dose aspirin is associated with a reduced risk of thrombosis in ET, though it may increase bleeding risk, particularly in PMF. Interventions like cytoreductive therapy and antiplatelet agents are used to mitigate these risks, and specific risk stratification models (e.g., IPSET, IPSET-Thrombosis) have been developed to guide management.",
      "conclusionB": "Patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) exhibit an increased risk of both thrombosis and hemorrhage, with the incidence of thrombotic events ranging from approximately 7.2% to 22% per patient-year, and bleeding events occurring in 6-12% of patients; critically, higher JAK2V617F allele burden ( >75%) and leukocytosis are independently associated with increased risk of these vascular complications, particularly arterial thrombosis, while prior thrombotic events are the strongest predictor of future events."

      "# Title: What determines and are the consequences of surveillance intensity after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair?\n# Abstract: Follow-up examinations are advised 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months and yearly thereafter by the European Collaborating Group on Stent-Graft Techniques for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair (EUROSTAR). The aim of this study was to evaluate the determinants and consequences of surveillance completeness. Patients who underwent endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair between October 1996 and August 2004 and enrolled in the EUROSTAR registry were analyzed. Two groups were compared: patients who attended all scheduled visits (group A) and those who came infrequently (group B). Odds ratios and hazard rates (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined to detect which patient characteristics and complications were associated with follow-up intensity. Of the 4,433 patients, 1,538 (35%) attended all scheduled visits until the end of follow-up (group A). Analysis of patient characteristics demonstrated that intensive visitors were more often smokers, hyperlipemic, and considered unfit for open surgery or general anesthesia. Complications during follow-up, including endoleaks (24% vs. 20%), kinking (3.5% vs. 2.5%), and migration (4.9% vs. 3.5%), appeared significantly more frequently in group A. Despite intensive follow-up of this category, still a greater proportion died (12% vs. 9%, adjusted HR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.8). After 84 months of follow-up, the cumulative survival rates in groups A and B were 71% and 74%, respectively (p < 0.0001). It seems that follow-up intensity was based on baseline patient characteristics. High-risk patients had, despite more intensive surveillance, still more complications after adjustment for patient, morphological, and center-specific characteristics. Further assessment is indicated to evaluate the effectiveness of different frequencies of surveillance visits.",

      "conclusionA": "While surveillance is a valid management strategy for unruptured intracranial aneurysms, its benefit is significantly modified by patient and aneurysm characteristics; **personalized risk stratification – integrating aneurysm size and growth rate, neck morphology, and underlying patient comorbidities – is essential to optimize outcomes, shifting from surveillance to intervention based on individual risk profiles rather than a uniform approach.**",
      "conclusionB": "Despite more intensive imaging surveillance—defined as attendance at all scheduled follow-up visits—patients undergoing endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair exhibited a significantly higher adjusted hazard of mortality (HR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.8) and a trend towards increased post-operative complications, suggesting that increased surveillance frequency does not improve outcomes and may identify a higher-risk cohort."

      "# Title: Thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications in essential thrombocythemia. A retrospective study of 103 patients.\n# Abstract: A retrospective study of 103 patients with essential thrombocythemia was carried out to evaluate the incidence of thrombohemorrhagic complications and establish whether there were any correlations between these events and clinical or laboratory data. At onset or during the course of the disease, 26 patients (25.2%) presented thrombotic and 12 (11.6%) hemorrhagic complications: among the latter, six patients had gastrointestinal bleeding during antiaggregant therapy. No significant correlations were observed between thrombohemorrhagic complications and platelet count, age, sex, platelet function, bleeding time, or therapeutic regimen. However, there was a statistically significant correlation between a positive patient history for thrombotic events and an increase in thromboses. In agreement with other authors, it is believed that the best approach in asymptomatic patients is strict surveillance without treatment. Chemotherapy and/or treatment with antiaggregant agents should be reserved for symptomatic patients or patients with a positive history for thrombotic events.",
      "# Title: Clinical course of essential thrombocythemia in 147 cases.\n# Abstract: The authors retrospectively analyzed the initial characteristics, treatment, and clinical course in 147 patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET). Median age was 60 years and the M:F ratio was 0.69. At diagnosis, 53 patients were asymptomatic; 50 patients had functional symptoms (mainly vasomotor disturbances); 27 patients had large vessel thrombosis; 27 patients had a bleeding diathesis; and seven patients had both bleeding and thrombosis. The platelet count ranged from 0.7 to 2.92 X 10(12)/l. Forty-five of the 61 tested patients (61%) had prolonged bleeding time and/or platelet hypoaggregation. Three patients had in vitro spontaneous aggregation. No significant correlations were found between hemostatic findings and in vivo bleeding or thrombosis. The incidence of bleeding, however, was higher in patients with more than 2 x 10(12)/l platelets. Of 87 karyotypes performed with banding techniques, only four were abnormal. One hundred twenty-nine patients received one or more cytoreductive agents at diagnosis or during follow-up. Sixty patients received an antiaggregating agent. First-line therapy was radiophosphorus (32P) in 22 patients; busulfan in 35 patients; and hydroxyurea in 72 patients. Hydroxyurea required continuous maintenance therapy and had to be changed to another treatment in 12 of the initial responders because of inadequate control of thrombocythemia. During follow-up, 14 treated patients experienced one or several major thrombotic events. Two untreated patients also had major thrombosis. Only one major bleeding event was seen during follow-up. Median actuarial survival was 73.5% at 7 years and only one patient progressed to acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). These results suggest that large vessel thrombosis is the main complication of ET. It appears largely unpredictable in a given patient at diagnosis but can be largely prevented by the control of thrombocythemia. Because of the low incidence of side effects of treatment in this experience, the authors believe that cytoreductive therapy is indicated in most patients with ET, as long as a group of patients with very low risk of thrombosis is not defined in prospective studies.",
      "# Title: Major vascular complications in essential thrombocythemia: a study of the predictive factors in a series of 148 patients.\n# Abstract: To determine the clinicohematological factors predictive for the appearance of major vascular complications (MVC) in patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET), 148 consecutive such patients were retrospectively assessed for the development of MVC during a median follow-up of 58.5 months. Seventy-seven patients had vascular risk factors, and 37 a history of MVC at ET diagnosis. Forty-nine MVC were registered in 33 patients during the follow-up period. The actuarial probability of MVC was 27% at 6 years in the whole series, 35.6% for patients above 60 years, and 21.4% for patients younger than 60 years, whereas only one of the 36 patients younger than 45 years had MVC. At multivariate analysis, age >60 years, history of major ischemia and hypercholesterolemia were the variables associated with an increased MVC risk. These results suggest that all ET patients above 60 years should be treated, whereas in younger patients treatment decisions should be primarily based on the existence of risk factors for MVC.",
      "# Title: Thrombosis and bleeding in myeloproliferative disorders: identification of at-risk patients with whole blood platelet aggregation studies.\n# Abstract: Seventy-five patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders were studied to investigate platelet function by simultaneous measurement of platelet aggregation by the impedance method and ATP dense granule release using a whole blood platelet lumi-aggregometer, in an attempt to identify patients at risk for thrombosis and bleeding. Thirty-nine patients had at least one abnormal result indicating platelet hyperactivity (i.e. impedance or release with one agonist being above the reference range); 16 patients had platelet hypoactivity (i.e. at least one result was below the reference range), whilst 14 had co-existence of hyper- and hypoactivity. Six patients had normal results. 20/53 patients with platelet hyperactivity (alone or mixed) had a positive history of venous and/or arterial thrombosis; in comparison, only two of the other 22 patients had a positive history. During a median follow-up of 33 months, nine patients with and one patient without platelet hyperactivity respectively developed new thrombotic events before the addition of specific therapy. A total of 50 patients with and eight patients without platelet hyperactivity respectively received specific treatment including aspirin and/or cytotoxic therapy. All but one elderly patient with platelet hyperactivity have remained free of new thrombotic events on specific therapy. Two of the 17 patients with platelet hypoactivity had major clinical bleeding. These observations highlight the need to test platelets for hyper- as well as hypo-function and suggest a useful role for routine whole blood platelet aggregation studies to identify the patients at risk for thrombosis or bleeding.",
      "# Title: Incidence, clinical features and outcome of essential thrombocythaemia in a well defined geographical area.\n# Abstract: In an attempt to characterise the clinical features, incidence and outcome of essential thrombocythaemia (ET) we report our experience in a large unselected series of patients from a well defined region. All new cases of ET in the County of Copenhagen were registered during the period 1977-98. We identified 96 cases of ET, yielding an age- and sex-adjusted annual incidence rate of 0.59/100.000 and a point-prevalence at last follow up of 11/100.000. The overall incidence rate was 0.31 and 1.00 per 100.000 population during the consecutive periods 1977-89 and 1990-98, respectively, corresponding to a 3.2-fold increase. Median age at diagnosis was 67 yr (females 68 yr, males 66 yr, range 18-87 yr), and the female to male (F/M) ratio was 2.6:1. At diagnosis, 52% of the patients displayed no ET-related symptoms and were discovered fortuitously by a routine platelet count. Forty-eight percent presented with thrombohaemorrhagic phenomena, of which microvascular disturbances of the central nervous system (CNS), extremities and skin were most frequently observed (23%). Compared to patients diagnosed after 1989, patients diagnosed before 1990 had a significantly higher mean platelet count, white blood cell (WBC) count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) value and alkaline phosphatase value. With a median follow up of 70 months, 5-yr survival was 76%, significantly lower than the expected survival of an age- and sex-matched control group (p = 0.0052). Thirty-seven patients experienced a total of 55 thrombohaemorrhagic events during follow-up, corresponding to an incidence of thrombosis and microvascular disturbances or haemorrhage of 8.1% per pt-yr and 2.5% per pt-yr, respectively. The number of patients experiencing thrombosis or microvascular disturbances was significantly higher among the 29 patients who never received acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) compared to the 67 patients who received ASA during follow up (45% vs. 21%; p = 0.017). This study provides population-based data suggesting the benefit of treatment with low-dose ASA in a non-selected population of patients with ET.",

      "# Title: Frequency and risk factors for thrombosis in idiopathic myelofibrosis: analysis in a series of 155 patients from a single institution.\n# Abstract: Thrombosis is a frequent complication of polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia, but its incidence and predisposing factors in idiopathic myelofibrosis (IM) are unknown. In 18 (11.6%) of 155 patients diagnosed with IM in a single institution, 31 thrombotic events (19 arterial, 12 venous) were registered after a mean follow-up of 4.2 (s.d.: 4.5) years. In six patients, the thrombosis was simultaneous to or appeared a few months before IM diagnosis and 14 had one or more thrombotic episodes. When compared with the general population, a significant increase was observed in the incidence of venous thrombosis (odds ratio 17.5, 95% confidence interval: 10.3-31.4). At multivariate analysis, the initial variables associated with an increased risk of thrombosis were thrombocytosis (platelets >450 x 10(9)/l, P=0.001), presence of one cardiovascular risk factor (arterial hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes, P=0.003), cellular phase of myelofibrosis (P=0.005), and Hb >11 g/dl (P=0.02). Considering post-diagnosis events, the 5-year thrombosis-free survival probability was 90.4% in the series, 80.6% for patients with platelets >450 x 10(9)/l, 82.6% for patients with one cardiovascular risk factor, and 85.1% for those in cellular phase. These results indicate an increased thrombotic risk for IM patients with hyperproliferative features and/or coexistent cardiovascular risk factors.",

      "# Title: Leukocytosis is a risk factor for thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia: interaction with treatment, standard risk factors, and Jak2 mutation status.\n# Abstract: Leukocytes contribute to the pathogenesis of thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia (ET) through recently discovered mechanisms of activation and interaction with platelets and endothelial cells. To evaluate whether an increased leukocyte count was associated with thrombosis and whether this effect can be modulated by therapy, we analyzed the clinical course of 439 patients with ET followed at the Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo. The strength of the association was measured at diagnosis or before thrombotic events by multivariable analyses carried out using data at baseline as well as time-varying covariates. The results showed that (1) an increased leukocyte count at diagnosis was associated with thrombosis during follow-up (\"baseline analysis,\" relative risk [RR] 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-3.9, P = .001); (2) hydroxyurea (HU) lowered leukocytosis and reduced the strength of the association between leukocytosis and thrombosis (\"time-dependent analysis,\" RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.9-2.0, not significant [NS]); (3) the association of leukocytosis and thrombosis was more evident in untreated low-risk patients (RR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-6.4, P = .01) compared with HU-treated high-risk patients (RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.8-3.2, NS); and (4) the presence of JAK2 V617F was not identified as a risk factor for thrombosis during follow-up despite a significant association between the mutation and leukocytosis. We suggest validation of these findings in prospective clinical studies.",
      "# Title: Clinical profile of homozygous JAK2 617V>F mutation in patients with polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia.\n# Abstract: JAK2 617V>F mutation occurs in a homozygous state in 25% to 30% of patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and 2% to 4% with essential thrombocythemia (ET). Whether homozygosity associates with distinct clinical phenotypes is still under debate. This retrospective multicenter study considered 118 JAK2 617V>F homozygous patients (104 PV, 14 ET) whose clinical characteristics were compared with those of 587 heterozygous and 257 wild-type patients. Irrespective of their clinical diagnosis, homozygous patients were older, displayed a higher leukocyte count and hematocrit value at diagnosis, and presented larger spleen volume. Aquagenic pruritus was significantly more common among homozygous PV patients. JAK2 617V>F homozygosity associated with more frequent evolution into secondary myelofibrosis in both PV and ET. After adjustment for sex, age, leukocyte count, and previous thrombosis in a multivariate analysis, homozygous ET patients displayed a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio [HR] 3.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-11.7; P = .013) than wild-type (HR = 1.0) or heterozygous patients (HR = 1.49). No significant association of JAK2 617V>F homozygosity with thrombosis risk was observed in PV. Finally, JAK2 617V>F homozygous patients were more likely to receive chemotherapy for control of disease. We conclude that JAK2 617V>F homozygosity identifies PV or ET patients with a more symptomatic myeloproliferative disorder and is associated with a higher risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with ET.",
      "# Title: Vascular events in Korean patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and their relationship to JAK2 mutation.\n# Abstract: Evaluation of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F mutation has been widely used for the diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). However, its prognostic relevance to clinical outcome is not completely understood. We investigated the association of JAK2 V617F with vascular events in Korean patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). We studied 283 patients from 15 centers, who were diagnosed with MPN. The JAK2 V617F status was evaluated by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. The patients' diagnoses were essential thrombocythemia (ET n = 146), polycythemia vera (PV n = 120), primary myelofibrosis (n = 12), and unclassifiable MPN (MPNu n = 5). JAK2 V617F was detected in 89 (61%) patients with ET, 103 (86%) with PV, four (33%) with myelofibrosis, and four (80%) with MPNu. A higher number of leukocytes, haemoglobin levels and BM cellularity as well as an older age, lower platelet counts, and diagnosis of PV were significantly correlated with JAK2 V617F. Eighty-three and 43 episodes of thrombosis and bleeding occurred in 100 patients each before and after the diagnosis. Vascular events more frequently occurred in 37% of patients with JAK2 V617F than in 29% of those without the mutation (p = 0.045). Among 175 patients whose samples were available for sequencing, 28 patients with homozygous JAK2 V617F had vascular events more frequently (57%) than those who were heterozygotes (39%) or had the wild type (27%) (p = 0.03). The multivariate analysis showed that a JAK2 homozygous mutation, hypercholesterolemia and older age were independent risk factors for a vascular event. The results of this study showed that Korean patients with MPN had a similar JAK2 mutation rate and frequency of vascular events when compared to Western patients. The presence of V617F was significantly related to vascular events. Therefore, initial evaluation for the JAK2 mutation and careful monitoring for vascular events should be performed in MPN patients.",
      "# Title: Thrombosis in primary myelofibrosis: incidence and risk factors.\n# Abstract: We assessed frequency and predictive factors for major cardiovascular (CV) events in 707 patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) followed in 4 European institutions. A total of 236 deaths (33%) were recorded for an overall mortality of 7.7% patient-years (pt-yr). Fatal and nonfatal thromboses were registered in 51 (7.2%) patients, with a rate of 1.75% pt-yr. If deaths from non-CV causes were considered as competing events, we estimated that the adjusted rate of major thrombotic events would have been 2.2% pt-yr. In a multivariable model, age older than 60 years (hazard ratio [HR], 2.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-4.39, P = .01) and JAK2 mutational status (HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.10-3.34; P = .02) were significantly associated with thrombosis, whereas the strength of the association between leukocyte count higher than 15 x 10(9)/L and CV events was of borderline significance (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 0.97-2.72; P = .06). The highest incidence of fatal and nonfatal thrombosis was observed when the mutation was present along with leukocytosis (3.9% pt-yr; HR, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.26-7.81). This study is the largest hitherto carried out in this setting and shows that the rate of major CV events in PMF is comparable with that reported in essential thrombocythemia, and it is increased in aged patients and those with JAK2 V617F mutation and leukocytosis.",
      "# Title: Thrombosis in myelofibrosis: prior thrombosis is the only predictive factor and most venous events are provoked.\n# Abstract: In a retrospective analysis of 205 patients (median age 62 years) with primary myelofibrosis and known JAK2V617F mutational status, 13.2% experienced a vaso-occlusive event at or prior to their diagnosis. After a median follow up of 31 months, post-diagnosis thrombosis occurred in 22 patients (10.7%), including 9 (4.4%) and 16 (7.8%) patients with a total of 9 arterial and 24 venous events, respectively. The majority (71%) of the venous events were temporally associated with other exogenous risk factors for thrombosis such as surgery, line placement or hormonal therapy. On multivariable analysis that included age, JAK2V617F mutation status and leukocyte count as covariates, history of thrombosis was the only predictive variable in general (P=0.04) or when arterial (P=0.007) and venous (P=0.02) thromboses were analyzed separately. The current study demonstrates a higher prevalence of venous, as opposed to arterial, events in PMF, post-diagnosis, and clarifies their nature as being mostly provoked.",
      "# Title: Impact of leukocytosis on thrombotic risk and survival in 532 patients with essential thrombocythemia: a retrospective study.\n# Abstract: Established risk factors for thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia (ET) include age (≥ 60 years) and previous vascular events. Recently, also leukocytosis has been proposed in risk stratification of ET patients. We report a retrospective study on 532 ET patients followed for a median of 7.6 years. Sixty-four patients (12%) developed 95 thrombotic events during follow-up. Together with the high-risk condition, a white blood cell (WBC) value above 11 × 10⁹/L, corresponding to the fourth percentile value, significantly correlated with a higher thrombotic risk (p = 0.033) by Cox proportional hazards. Moreover, the cumulative risk of thrombosis was significantly higher in high-risk patients with WBC >11 × 10⁹/L. JAK2 V617F mutation did not correlate with thrombosis. Overall, 123 (23%) patients died. Three independent parameters were noted as prognostic factors for survival in multivariate analysis: age > 60 years, leukocytosis >11 × 10⁹/L, and hemoglobin level below normal values. Based on these parameters, three groups of risk were defined, with significantly different survivals. Baseline leukocytosis correlated with a higher thrombotic risk in high-risk patients and identified a cohort of patients with worse survival.",
      "# Title: Incidence and risk factors for bleeding in 1104 patients with essential thrombocythemia or prefibrotic myelofibrosis diagnosed according to the 2008 WHO criteria.\n# Abstract: In an international study of 1104 patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET), a histological review according to the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria confirmed ET in 891 patients (WHO-ET, 81%), and revised the diagnosis to prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis (PMF) in 180 patients (PMF, 16%). Major bleeding during follow-up occurred in 55 (6%) WHO-ET and 21 (12%) PMF patients (P = 0.009), at a rate of 0.79 and 1.39% patients per year, respectively, (P = 0.039). In a multivariable analysis, predictors of bleeding included diagnosis of PMF (P = 0.05; hazard ratio (HR) 1.74), leukocytosis (P = 0.04; HR 1.74), previous hemorrhage (P = 0.025; HR 2.35) and aspirin therapy (P=0.001; HR 3.16). The analysis restricted to patients with WHO-ET confirmed previous hemorrhage (P = 0.043; HR 1.92) and aspirin (P=0.027; HR 2.24) as independent risk factors. The current study reveals that major bleeding associated with thrombocytosis might be relatively specific to PMF, as opposed to WHO-defined ET. Furthermore, it shows that low-dose aspirin exacerbates these hemorrhagic events of PMF. In contrast, thrombocytosis per se was not a risk factor for bleeding; however, low-dose aspirin had a synergistic hemorrhagic effect unmasking the bleeding tendency of patients with extreme thrombocytosis. These observations carry significant therapeutic implications in these two WHO entities.",
      "# Title: Leukocytosis as an important risk factor for arterial thrombosis in WHO-defined early/prefibrotic myelofibrosis: an international study of 264 patients.\n# Abstract: We aimed to determine risk factors for thrombotic events in early/prefibrotic myelofibrosis diagnosed according to the World Health Organization criteria. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was calculated on a total number of 264 patients derived from an international database. After a median follow-up of 6.28 years, 42 (15.9%) patients experienced arterial (n = 31) or venous thrombosis (n = 11). A higher leukocyte count correlated with an increased risk for total thrombosis and in particular, with an increased risk for arterial thrombosis (P = 0.005, HR 1.15 and P = 0.047, HR 1.12, respectively). A platelet count above 870 × 10⁹/L was associated with a lower risk for total thrombosis and also for venous thrombosis (P = 0.022, HR 0.44 and P = 0.027, HR 0.19). Moreover, a lower hemoglobin level was associated with an increased risk for venous thrombosis (P = 0.007, HR 0.59). Our data indicate that leukocytosis is a prominent risk factor for thrombosis in early/prefibrotic MF.",

      "# Title: Thromboses and hemorrhages are common in MPN patients with high JAK2V617F allele burden.\n# Abstract: The most common causes of morbidity and mortality in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications. The JAK2V617F mutation, commonly found in MPN, correlates with several clinical and laboratory characteristics even if the relevance of JAK2V617F allele burden in the natural history of these diseases is unclear. In this study we searched, a relation between thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications and JAK2V617F allele burden level in MPN patients. We evaluated 253 consecutive MPN [121 essential thrombocythemia (ET), 124 polycythemia vera (PV), and 8 primary myelofibrosis (PMF)] patients in whom the JAK2V617F allele burden was available, all studied and followed (median 8.8 years) in our department. Patients were stratified accordingly to their JAK2V617F allele burden, into four quartiles (1st <25%, 2nd 26-50%, 3rd 51-75%, and 4th >75%). Significantly higher incidence of thromboses (p = 0.001) and hemorrhages (p < 0.001) during follow-up has been observed in higher quartiles when compared to lower ones. Thrombosis- and hemorrhage-free survivals were poorer in patients belonging to the highest quartile. Our data suggest that MPN patients with JAK2V617F allele burden higher than 75% have to be considered as high risk patients, being prone to develop thrombo-hemorrhagic complications during the disease course.",
      "# Title: Risk factors for arterial versus venous thrombosis in polycythemia vera: a single center experience in 587 patients.\n# Abstract: In a recent International Working Group on Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) study, prior arterial events and hypertension were predictors of subsequent arterial thrombosis whereas prior venous events and age ≥65 years predicted venous thrombosis in polycythemia vera (PV). In the current study, we sought to validate the above findings and identify additional predictors of arterial versus venous thrombosis. At a median follow up of 109 months, thrombosis after diagnosis occurred in 128 (22%) patients; 82 (14%) arterial and 57 (10%) venous events. On multivariate analysis, prior arterial events (<0.0001), hyperlipidemia (p = 0.03), and hypertension (p = 0.02) predicted subsequent arterial events. In comparison, prior venous events (p = 0.05), leukocytosis ≥11 × 109/L (p = 0.002), and major hemorrhage (p = 0.02) were predictors of subsequent venous events. Salient associations with arterial thrombosis included age ≥ 60 years, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and normal karyotype whereas age ≤ 60 years, females, palpable splenomegaly and history of major hemorrhage were associated with venous thrombosis. TET2 or ASXL1 mutations did not impact arterial nor venous thrombosis. In conclusion, we identify distinct associations for arterial versus venous thrombosis in PV and confirm that a prior arterial or venous thrombotic event is the most reliable predictor of subsequent events.",
      "# Title: Evaluation of vascular events in patients with myeloproliferative syndromes and mutations of either the januskinase-2 or calreticulin gene at the university hospital Krems from 2008 to 2015.\n# Abstract: Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), classified as polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis (ET) and myelofibrosis (MF) are stem-cell derived disorders. Mutations in either the januskinase-2 (JAK-2) or the calreticulin (CALR) gene are characteristic for MPN and may result in enhanced proliferation of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets, and thus increase the risk for vascular events. This study is a retrospective and descriptive analysis of records of patients, who underwent treatment for myeloproliferative syndromes at the Department of Hemato-Oncology of the University hospital Krems from 2008 to the end of 2015. Out of 250 patients, who were suspected for MPN, 51 patients displayed a JAK-2 V617F mutation. These were analyzed with regard to their blood values, gender, age at diagnosis, therapy and vascular events before and after diagnosis (during therapy). Of the 51 patients diagnosed with MPN and a JAK-2 V617F mutation, 33 suffered from PV, 15 from ET and 3 from MF. More men than women were diagnosed with MPN and the median age at diagnosis was 72 years. Acetylsalicylic acid, phlebotomy and Hydroxyurea were the most frequent therapies applied. In our study cohort, the most common vascular events were acute coronary syndrome and transitory ischemic attack. Thromboembolic events were effectively reduced by MPN therapy while no elevation in bleeding events could be observed.",
      "# Title: Clinico-hematological profile and thrombotic/hemorrhagic events in 150 chinese patients with essential thrombocythemia.\n# Abstract: Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is an uncommon chronic myeloproliferative disorder with no cure. Patients with ET are at risk of different complications, and currently there are no optimal prognostic standards to predict severe post-diagnosis complications such as thrombosis and hemorrhage. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the full set of clinical data from 150 Chinese patients with ET enrolled from 2013 to 2016. We discovered that neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), along with other known clinical parameters such as age, leukocyte count, incidence of thrombotic events is higher in patients with JAK2 V617F mutation. NLR is also higher in patients at high-risk stratification of thrombosis. Multivariate analysis showed that age (P = 0.001, 95% CI 1.023-1.089) and JAK2 V617F mutation (P = 0.003, 95% CI 1.837-21.035) were independent factors for thrombotic events, while age (P = 0.005, 95% CI 1.019-1.111) was the only predictive factor for hemorrhagic events at diagnosis. For future thrombotic events, multivariate analysis revealed NLR as the best predictive parameter (P < 0.001, 95% CI 1.173-1.486) when compared with other clinical parameters such as age (P = 0.037, 95% CI 1.004-1.126), thrombosis at diagnosis (P = 0.036, 95% CI 1.077-9.099) and WBC count (P = 0.047, 95% CI 1.001-1.109). Further ROC curve and Kaplan Meier analysis validated NLR as better prognostic marker for future thrombotic events and thrombosis-free survival. In summary, our data suggest that NLR parameter may possess great prognostic significance for future thrombosis in ET patients."

      "conclusionA": "**Primary Concluding Statement:**\n\nAmong patients with Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), including essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), there is a significantly increased risk of both thrombosis and hemorrhage. Key risk factors identified across multiple studies include older age (particularly >60 years), history of prior vascular events (thrombotic or hemorrhagic), leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count), JAK2 V617F mutation status (especially homozygosity in ET), and specific disease characteristics like cellular phase in myelofibrosis or high platelet counts in ET. Low-dose aspirin is associated with a reduced risk of thrombosis in ET, though it may increase bleeding risk, particularly in PMF. Interventions like cytoreductive therapy and antiplatelet agents are used to mitigate these risks, and specific risk stratification models (e.g., IPSET, IPSET-Thrombosis) have been developed to guide management.",
      "conclusionB": "Patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) exhibit an increased risk of both thrombosis and hemorrhage, with the incidence of thrombotic events ranging from approximately 7.2% to 22% per patient-year, and bleeding events occurring in 6-12% of patients; critically, higher JAK2V617F allele burden ( >75%) and leukocytosis are independently associated with increased risk of these vascular complications, particularly arterial thrombosis, while prior thrombotic events are the strongest predictor of future events."

      "# Title: Expression of a hepatitis A virus antigen in Lactococcus lactis and Escherichia coli and evaluation of its immunogenicity.\n# Abstract: An epidemic shift in Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection has been observed in recent years in rapidly developing countries, with increasing numbers of severe adult cases which has led to renewed interest in vaccination. Our approach in vaccine development uses recombinant expression of the highly immunogenic HAV antigen VP1-P2a in food-grade lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis and in Escherichia coli. We used genetic constructs that enable nisin-controlled expression of the antigen in L. lactis in three different forms: (a) intracellularly, (b) on the bacterial surface and (c) on the bacterial surface fused with the fragment of the E. coli flagellin molecule that can act as a molecular adjuvant. Expression of the two surface forms of the antigen was achieved in L. lactis, and the resulting antigen-displaying bacteria were administered orally to mice. Half the animals in each of the two groups developed specific IgGs, with titers increasing over time and reaching 1:422 without flagellin and 1:320 with flagellin. A much higher titer 1:25,803 was observed with the parenterally administered antigen, which was purified from E. coli. With the latter, a significant mucosal IgA response was also observed. Despite significant titers, the IgGs elicited with oral or parenteral administration could not prevent HAV from infecting cells in a virus neutralization assay, suggesting that the antibodies cannot recognize viral surface epitopes. Nevertheless, orally administered HAV antigen expressed in L. lactis elicited significant systemic humoral immune response showing the feasibility for development of effective HAV vaccine for mucosal delivery.",
      "# Title: Oral immunization with recombinant Lactococcus lactis delivering a multi-epitope antigen CTB-UE attenuates Helicobacter pylori infection in mice.\n# Abstract: Urease is an essential virulence factor and colonization factor for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and is considered as an excellent vaccine candidate antigen. However, conventional technologies for preparing an injectable vaccine require purification of the antigenic protein and preparation of an adjuvant. Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 (L. lactis) could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of edible vaccine. In previous study, we constructed a multi-epitope vaccine, designated CTB-UE, which is composed of the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), three Th cell epitopes and two B-cell epitopes from urease subunits. To develop a novel type of oral vaccine against H. pylori, genetically modified L. lactis strains were established to secrete this epitope vaccine extracellularly in this study. Oral prophylactic immunization with recombinant L. lactis significantly elicited humoral anti-urease antibody responses (P < 0.001) and reduced the gastric colonization of H. pylori from 7.14 ± 0.95 to 4.68 ± 0.98 log10 CFU g(-1) stomach. This L. lactis oral vaccine offers a promising vaccine candidate for the control of H. pylori infection.",
      "# Title: Development of a new DNA vaccine based on mycobacterial ESAT-6 antigen delivered by recombinant invasive Lactococcus lactis FnBPA+.\n# Abstract: The use of the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis as a vehicle for the oral delivery of DNA vaccine plasmids constitutes a promising strategy for vaccination. The delivery of DNA plasmids into eukaryotic cells is of critical importance for subsequent DNA expression and effectiveness of the vaccine. In this context, the use of the recombinant invasive L. lactis FnBPA+ (fibronectin-binding protein A) strain for the oral delivery of the eukaryotic expression vector vaccination using lactic acid bacteria (pValac), coding for the 6-kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6) gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, could represent a new DNA vaccine strategy against tuberculosis. To this end, the ESAT-6 sequence was cloned into the pValac vector; the L. lactis fibronectin-binding protein A (FnBPA)+ (pValac:ESAT-6) strain was obtained, and its immunological profile was checked in BALB/c mice. This strain was able to significantly increase interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production in spleen cells, showing a systemic T helper 1 (Th1) cell response. The mice also showed a significant increase in specific secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) production in colon tissue and fecal extracts. Thus, this is the first time that L. lactis has been used to deliver a plasmid DNA harboring a gene that encodes an antigen against tuberculosis through mucous membranes.",
      "# Title: Lactococcus lactis displayed neuraminidase confers cross protective immunity against influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Influenza A viruses pose a serious threat to public health. Current influenza A vaccines predominantly focus on hemagglutinin (HA) and show strain-specific protection. Neuraminidase (NA) is much less studied in the context of humoral immunity against influenza A viruses. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cross protective immunity of NA presented on Lactococcus lactis (L.lactis) surface against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in the mouse model. L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA was constructed in which pgsA was used as an anchor protein. Mice vaccinated orally with L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA could elicit significant NA-specific serum IgG and mucosa IgA antibodies, as well as neuraminidase inhibition (NI) titers. Importantly, L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA provided 80% protection against H5N1, 60% protection against H3N2 and H1N1, respectively. These findings suggest that recombinant L.lactis/pNZ110-pgsA-NA in the absence of adjuvant via oral administration can be served as an effective vaccine candidate against diverse strains of influenza A viruses.",
      "# Title: Broadly protective immunity against divergent influenza viruses by oral co-administration of Lactococcus lactis expressing nucleoprotein adjuvanted with cholera toxin B subunit in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines need to be annually reformulated to well match the predicated circulating strains. Thus, it is critical for developing a novel universal influenza vaccine that would be able to confer cross-protection against constantly emerging divergent influenza virus strains. Influenza virus A is a genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses. Influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) is a structural protein which encapsidates the negative strand viral RNA, and anti-NP antibodies play role in cross-protective immunity. Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) is an ideal vaccine delivery vehicle via oral administration route. However, L. lactis vectored vaccine exhibits poor immunogenicity without the use of mucosal adjuvant. To enhance the immunogenicity of L. lactis vectored vaccine, cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit, one of mucosal adjuvants, is a safe adjuvant for oral route, when combined with L. lactis vectored vaccine. In this study, we hypothesized that pNZ8008, a L. lactis expression plasmid, encoding NP antigen, would be able to elicit cross-protection with the use of CTB via oral administration route.",
      "# Title: Cross-protection of Lactococcus lactis-displayed HA2 subunit against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines provide strain-specific protection against homologous subtypes and need to be updated annually. Therefore, it is essential to develop a universal vaccine that would induce broadly cross-protective immunity against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses. The highly conserved HA2 subunit is a promising candidate for developing a universal influenza vaccine. Here, we hypothesized that the HA2 subunit could be displayed on the surface of Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis), using Spax as an anchor protein (L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2) and that L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 would have immunogenicity by oral administration without the use of adjuvant in the mouse model. To address this hypothesis, we show that oral vaccination of mice with L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 elicited significant humoral and mucosal immune responses. Importantly, L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 provided 100% protection against homologous H5N1 or heterologous H1N1 virus challenge. These results suggest that an HA2 subunit presented on the surface of L. lactis is an effective universal vaccine candidate against influenza A viruses in the poultry industry and in humans.",
      "# Title: Oral Immunization with a Recombinant Lactococcus lactis-Expressing HIV-1 Antigen on Group A Streptococcus Pilus Induces Strong Mucosal Immunity in the Gut.\n# Abstract: The induction of a potent humoral and cellular immune response in mucosal tissue is important for the development of an effective HIV vaccine. Most of the current HIV vaccines under development use the i.m. route for immunization, which is relatively poor in generating potent and long-lived mucosal immune responses. In this article, we explore the ability of an oral vaccination with a probiotic organism, Lactococcus lactis, to elicit HIV-specific immune responses in the mucosal and systemic compartments of BALB/c mice. We expressed the HIV-1 Gag-p24 on the tip of the T3 pilus of Streptococcus pyogenes as a fusion to the Cpa protein (LL-Gag). After four monthly LL-Gag oral immunizations, we observed strong Gag-specific IgG and IgA responses in serum, feces, and vaginal secretions. However, the Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses in the blood were at or below our detection limit. After an i.m. modified vaccinia Ankara/Gag boost, we observed robust Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses both in systemic and in mucosal tissues, including intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes of the small intestine, Peyer's patches, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Consistent with strong immunogenicity, the LL-Gag induced activation of CD11c(+) CD11b(+) dendritic cells in the Peyer's patches after oral immunization. Our results demonstrate that oral immunization with L. lactis expressing an Ag on the tip of the group A Streptococcus pilus serves as an excellent vaccine platform to induce strong mucosal humoral and cellular immunity against HIV.",

      "# Title: Production and delivery of Helicobacter pylori NapA in Lactococcus lactis and its protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity.\n# Abstract: Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein A subunit (NapA) has been identified as a virulence factor, a protective antigen and a potent immunomodulator. NapA shows unique application potentials for anti-H. pylori vaccines and treatment strategies of certain allergic diseases and carcinomas. However, appropriate production and utilization modes of NapA still remain uncertain to date. This work has established a novel efficient production and utilization mode of NapA by using L. lactis as an expression host and delivery vector, and demonstrated immune protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity of the engineered L. lactis by oral vaccination of mice. It was observed for the first time that H. pylori NapA promotes both polarized Th17 and Th1 responses, which may greatly affect the clinical application of NapA. This report offers a promising anti-H. pylori oral vaccine candidate and a potent mucosal immune modulatory agent. Meanwhile, it uncovers a way to produce and deliver the oral vaccine and immunomodulator by fermentation of food like milk, which might have striking effects on control of H. pylori infection, gastrointestinal cancers, and Th2 bias allergic diseases, including many food allergies.",
      "# Title: Protective immunity induced by an intranasal multivalent vaccine comprising 10 Lactococcus lactis strains expressing highly prevalent M-protein antigens derived from Group A Streptococcus.\n# Abstract: Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) causes diseases ranging from mild pharyngitis to severe invasive infections. The N-terminal fragment of streptococcal M protein elicits protective antibodies and is an attractive vaccine target. However, this N- terminal fragment is hypervariable: there are more than 200 different M types. In this study, an intranasal live bacterial vaccine comprising 10 strains of Lactococcus lactis, each expressing one N-terminal fragment of M protein, has been developed. Live bacterial-vectored vaccines cost less to manufacture because the processes involved are less complex than those required for production of protein subunit vaccines. Moreover, intranasal administration does not require syringes or specialized personnel. Evaluation of individual vaccine types (M1, M2, M3, M4, M6, M9, M12, M22, M28 and M77) showed that most of them protected mice against challenge with virulent S. pyogenes. All 10 strains combined in a 10-valent vaccine (M×10) induced serum and bronchoalveolar lavage IgG titers that ranged from three- to 10-fold those of unimmunized mice. After intranasal challenge with M28 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice was significantly higher than that of unimmunized mice. In contrast, when mice were challenged with M75 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice did not differ significantly from that of unimmunized mice. Mx-10 immunized mice had significantly less S. pyogenes in oropharyngeal washes and developed less severe disease symptoms after challenge than did unimmunized mice. Our L. lactis-based vaccine may provide an alternative solution to development of broadly protective group A streptococcal vaccines.",
      "# Title: Mucosal and systemic immune responses elicited by recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a fusion protein composed of pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin from Bordetella pertussis.\n# Abstract: We constructed a food-grade expression system harboring a F1S1 fusion protein of Bordetella pertussis to be produced in Lactococcus lactis NZ3900 as a new oral vaccine model against whooping cough, caused by B. pertussis. F1S1 was composed of N-terminally truncated S1 subunit of pertussis toxin and type I immunodominant domain of filamentous hemagglutinin which are both known as protective immunogens against pertussis. The recombinant L. lactis was administered via oral or intranasal routes to BALB/c mice and the related specific systemic and mucosal immune responses were then evaluated. The results indicated significantly higher levels of specific IgA in the lung extracts and IgG in sera of mucosally-immunized mice, compared to their controls. It was revealed that higher levels of IgG2a, compared to IgG1, were produced in all mucosally-immunized mice. Moreover, immunized mice developed Th1 responses with high levels of IFN-γ production by the spleen cells. These findings provide evidence for L. lactis to be used as a suitable vehicle for expression and delivery of F1S1 fusion protein to mucosa and induction of appropriate systemic and mucosal immune responses against pertussis.",
      "# Title: Rotavirus VP6 protein mucosally delivered by cell wall-derived particles from Lactococcus lactis induces protection against infection in a murine model.\n# Abstract: Rotaviruses are the primary cause of acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide. Although the implementation of live attenuated vaccines has reduced the number of rotavirus-associated deaths, variance in their effectiveness has been reported in different countries. This fact, among other concerns, leads to continuous efforts for the development of new generation of vaccines against rotavirus.In this work, we describe the obtention of cell wall-derived particles from a recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a cell wall-anchored version of the rotavirus VP6 protein. After confirming by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, flow cytometry and electronic immunomicroscopy that these particles were carrying the VP6 protein, their immunogenic potential was evaluated in adult BALB/c mice. For that, mucosal immunizations (oral or intranasal), with or without the dmLT [(double mutant Escherichia coli heat labile toxin LT(R192G/L211A)] adjuvant were performed. The results showed that these cell wall-derived particles were able to generate anti-rotavirus IgG and IgA antibodies only when administered intranasally, whether the adjuvant was present or not. However, the presence of dmLT was necessary to confer protection against rotavirus infection, which was evidenced by a 79.5 percent viral shedding reduction.In summary, this work describes the production of cell wall-derived particles which were able to induce a protective immune response after intranasal immunization. Further studies are needed to characterize the immune response elicited by these particles as well as to determine their potential as an alternative to the use of live L. lactis for mucosal antigen delivery.",

      "# Title: A Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB)-Based Vaccine Candidate for Human Norovirus.\n# Abstract: Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are responsible for more than 95% of the non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis epidemics in the world. The CDC estimates that every year 21 million individuals suffer from HuNoV-induced gastroenteritis in the United States. Currently, there is no FDA-approved vaccine for HuNoVs. Development of an effective vaccine has been hampered by the lack of an efficient cell culture system for HuNoVs and a suitable small animal model for pathogenesis study. In this study, we developed lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as a vector to deliver HuNoV antigen. A LAB strain (Lactococcus lactis) carrying VP1 gene of a HuNoV GII.4 virus (LAB-VP1) was constructed. It was found that HuNoV VP1 protein was highly expressed by LAB vector and was secreted into media supernatants. To test whether LAB-based HuNoV vaccine candidate is immunogenic, 4-day-old gnotobiotic piglets were orally inoculated with various doses of LAB-VP1. It was found that LABs were persistent in the small intestine of piglets and shed in pig feces for at least 25 days post inoculation. LAB DNA and VP1 were detected in mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen tissue in LAB-VP1 inoculated groups. HuNoV-specific IgG and IgA were detectable in serum and feces respectively at day 13 post-inoculation, and further increased at later time points. After being challenged with HuNoV GII.4 strain, a large amount of HuNoV antigens were observed in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum sections of the intestine in the LAB control group. In contrast, significantly less, or no, HuNoV antigens were detected in the LAB-VP1 immunized groups. Collectively, these results demonstrate that a LAB-based HuNoV vaccine induces protective immunity in gnotobiotic piglets.",

      "# Title: Mucosal Vaccination with Lactococcus lactis-Secreting Surface Immunological Protein Induces Humoral and Cellular Immune Protection against Group B Streptococcus in a Murine Model.\n# Abstract: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the primary etiological agent of sepsis and meningitis in newborns and is associated with premature birth and stillbirth. The development of a licensed vaccine is one of the pending challenges for the World Health Organization. Previously, we showed that oral immunization with surface immune protein (SIP) decreases vaginal colonization of GBS and generates functional opsonizing antibodies, which was determined by opsonophagocytic assays (OPA) in vitro. We also showed that the protein has an adjuvant vaccine profile. Therefore, an oral vaccine based on SIP may be an attractive alternative to employ in the development of new vaccines against GBS. Lactococcus lactis is a highlighted oral vaccine probiotic inducer of the mucosal immune response. This bacterium could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of an edible vaccine and has been used in clinical trials. In this study, we showed that an oral vaccine with a recombinant L. lactis strain secreting SIP from GBS (rL. lactis-SIP) can induce protective humoral and cellular immunity in an experimental model of GBS vaginal colonization in C57BL/6 mice. Mice immunized with rL. lactis-SIP were protected against clinical symptoms and bacterial colonization after GBS vaginal colonization. Our rL. lactis-SIP vaccine also induces an increase of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) specifically against SIP. The adoptive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice to naïve mice generated protection against GBS vaginal colonization. Moreover, the rL. lactis-SIP strain induces the activation of SIP-specific T cells, which could decrease GBS vaginal colonization and generate protective antibodies when transferred to other mice. Our experimental observations strongly support the notion that rL. lactis-SIP induces protective humoral and cellular immunity and could be considered as a novel alternative in the development of vaccines for GBS.",
      "# Title: Recombinant Lactococcus Lactis Displaying Omp31 Antigen of Brucella melitensis Can Induce an Immunogenic Response in BALB/c Mice.\n# Abstract: Since Brucella infection mostly occurs through the mucosal surfaces, immune response induced by vaccine that is delivered by a way of mucosal route can be drastically enhanced to control the brucellosis. Omp31is the major outer membrane protein of Brucella, and is considered as a protective antigen against Brucella infection. Accordingly, Lactococcus lactis has been used as an antigen-delivering vector to develop a vaccine-induced mucosal response for having a safer vaccination against brucellosis. A designed omp31 gene fused to the usp45 signal peptide and M6 cell wall anchor was sub cloned in the pNZ7021 expression vector, and a recombinant L. lactis displaying Omp31 was constructed. Omp31 protein expression was confirmed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. Animals were orally and intraperitoneally immunized with live or killed L. lactis expressing Omp31, respectively. The humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated by measuring the specific cytokines and antibodies. sIgA, serum IgA, IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in the mice immunized with live recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31 and also serum IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in mice immunized with killed recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31. Among IgG subtypes, IgG2a response was significantly higher in both groups compared to IgG1. In mice groups immunized with recombinant L. lactis, the IFN-γ and IL-10 level elevated; however, there was no change in the level of IL-4. These results indicated that recombinants L. lactis induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, and also vaccines based on L. lactis-derived live carriers are promising interventions against Brucella melitensis infections.",
      "# Title: Lactococcus lactis FNBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) Induces Cellular and Humoral Immune Responses After Oral Immunization of Mice.\n# Abstract: The development of a new vaccine strategy against tuberculosis is urgently needed and has been greatly encouraged by the scientific community worldwide. In this work, we constructed a lactococcal DNA vaccine based on the fusion of two Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens, ESAT-6 and Ag85A, and examined its immunogenicity. The coding sequences of the ESAT-6 and Ag85A genes were fused and cloned into the eukaryotic expression pValac vector, and the functionality of the vector was confirmed in vitro. Then, L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) was obtained and used for oral immunization of mice. This strain induced significant increases in IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-17 cytokines in stimulated splenocyte cultures, and significant production of antigen-specific sIgA was observed in the colonic tissues of immunized mice. We demonstrated that L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) generated a cellular and humoral immune response after oral immunization of mice. The strategy developed in this work may represent an interesting DNA mucosal vaccine candidate against tuberculosis, using the fusion of two highly immunogenic antigens delivered by safe lactic acid bacteria.",
      "# Title: Protective Immunity Against Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli by Oral Vaccination of Engineered Lactococcus lactis.\n# Abstract: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the leading causes of diarrhea in children globally, and thus suitable vaccines are desired. Antigen display on lactic acid bacteria is a reliable approach for efficient oral vaccination and preventing bowel diseases. To develop an oral vaccine against ETEC, the gene of the binding domain from heat-labile toxin (LTB), a key ETEC virulence factor, was codon-optimized and cloned into a construct containing a signal peptide and an anchor for display on L. lactis. Bioinformatics analysis showed a codon adaptation index of 0.95 for the codon-optimized gene. Cell surface expression of LTB was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and blotting. White New Zealand rabbits were immunized per os (PO) with the recombinant L. lactis, and the antibody titers were assayed with ELISA. In vitro neutralization assay was performed using mouse adrenal tumor cells and rabbit ileal loop test was performed as the in vivo assay. ELISA results indicated that oral administration of the engineered L. lactis elicited a significant production of IgA in the intestine. In vitro neutralization assay showed that the effect of the toxin could be neutralized with 500 µg/ml of IgG isolated from the oral vaccine group. Furthermore, the dose of ETEC causing fluid accumulation in the ileal loop test showed a tenfold increase in rabbits immunized with either recombinant L. lactis or LTB protein compared to other groups. Our results imply that recombinant L. lactis could potentially be an effective live oral vaccine against ETEC toxicity.",
      "# Title: Oral Immunization of Mice with Cell Extracts from Recombinant Lactococcus lactis Expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein.\n# Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all over the world and became a pandemic that named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). At present, several intramuscular vaccines have been successfully developed and mass vaccination has progressed in many countries. The aim of the study is to develop and examine an oral vaccine against COVID-19 with recombinant Lactococcus lactis IL1403, a strain of lactic acid bacteria, expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) S1 subunit as an immunizing antigen. PBS or cell extracts from recombinant L. lactis were orally administered into mice (control VS treatment), and formation of antigen-specific antibodies and changes in the gut microbiome were analyzed. Intracellular antigen was detected, but its secretion was not successful. After immunization, antigen-specific serum IgG and fecal IgA levels were 1.5-fold (P = 0.002) and 1.4-fold (P = 0.016) higher in the immunized mice (treatment) than control, respectively. Gut microbiome profiles were clearly separated between the two groups when analyzed for beta diversity with overall similarity. At the genus level, while Coprococcus (P = 0.036) and unclassified genus of Ruminococcaceae (P = 0.037) in treatment were more abundant than control, rc4-4 (P = 0.013) and Stenotrophomonas (P = 0.021) were less abundant. Our results indicate that cell extract containing SARS-CoV-2 antigen can induce mice to produce antigen-specific antibodies without overall changes in the gut microbiome. This strategy may be useful for the development of other oral viral vaccines.",
      "# Title: Oral Immunization With a M Cell-Targeting Recombinant L. Lactis Vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE Stimulate Protective Immunity Against H. Pylori in Mice.\n# Abstract: There are many virulence factors of H. pylori that contribute in diverse ways to gastric disease. Therefore, designing multivalent epitope vaccines against many key virulence factors virulence factors of H. pylori is a promising strategy to control H. pylori infection. In previous studies, we constructed a multivalent epitope vaccine FVpE against four key virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), and oral immunization with the FVpE vaccine plus a polysaccharide adjuvant (PA) containing lycium barbarum polysaccharide and chitosan could provide protection against H. pylori infection in the Mongolian gerbil model. Oral vaccines have many advantages over injected vaccines, such as improved safety and compliance, and easier manufacturing and administration. However, the harsh gastrointestinal (GI) environment, such as gastric acid and proteolytic enzymes, limits the development of oral vaccines to some extent. Oral vaccines need a gastrointestinal delivery system with high safety, low price and promoting vaccine antigen to stimulate immune response in the gastrointestinal mucosa. Lactic acid bacteria are gastrointestinal probiotics that have unique advantages as a delivery system for oral vaccines. In this study, a M cell-targeting surface display system for L. lactis named plSAM was designed to help vaccine antigens to stimulate effective immune responses in the gastrointestinal tract, and a M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE was constructed by using the surface display system plSAM. recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE could secretively express the SAM-FVpE protein and display it on the bacterial surface. Moreover, experimental results confirmed that LL-plSAM-FVpE had an enhanced M cell-targeting property. In addition, LL-plSAM-FVpE had excellent M cell-targeting property to promote the phagocytosis and transport of the antigen SAM-FVpE by gastrointestinal M cells. More importantly, oral immunization of LL-plSAM-FVpE or SAM-FVpE plus PA can stimulate IgG and sIgA antibodies and CD4+ T cell immune responses against four virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), thus providing protective immunity against H. pylori infection in mice. The M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine against various key H. pylori virulence factors could be a promising vaccine candidate for controlling H. pylori infection.",
      "# Title: Oral and intranasal immunization with food-grade recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing high conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein triggers mice's immunity responses.\n# Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic began at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread throughout the world. Vaccination is still the most effective method of prevention of pathogenic infections, including viral infections. However, there is little evidence that vaccination can protect against SARS-CoV-2 virus for a long time. Thus, regular re-vaccination is necessary to control COVID-19. Vaccination by injection is invasive, and is one of the reasons people refuse to get re-vaccinated. Therefore, we developed a less invasive vaccine based on oral or nasal administration. The gene encoding the high conserved region (HCR) spike protein was inserted into pNZ8149 and expressed in L.lactis NZ3900. Mice were immunized at 3-week intervals with oral or nasal routes. Anti-SARS-CoV2 spike antibody (IgG and IgA) level were measured using ELISA method before and after treatment. Plasma cells population in lymph were analyzed using flowcytometry and the CD4 + and CD8 + cells in lymph and intestine were analyzed using immunofluorescence method. The results of nasal and oral administration in experimental animals showed that L.lactis carrying the HCR gene could induce a humoral immune response, as indicated by increased levels of IgG and IgA against SARS-CoV-2 (IgG/IgA-SARS-CoV-2). The plasma cell population after nasal and oral vaccination in mice were significantly different with control group (p < 0.05). The CD4 + and CD8 + cells in intestine were significantly higher in orally immunized group mice than control group. The CD8 + cells in lymph were significantly higher in intranasal immunized group mice than control group. Our data demonstrate L.lactis expressing spike protein can be developed into a less invasive alternative to nasal and oral vaccination.",
      "# Title: Expanding strain coverage of a group A Streptococcus pilus-expressing Lactococcus lactis mucosal vaccine.\n# Abstract: Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a human pathogenic bacterium that can trigger a wide range of diseases, including the autoimmune diseases acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, causing major morbidity and mortality in many low- and middle-income countries. Primary intervention programs have had limited success thus far, and a licensed vaccine has yet to be developed. The pilus of GAS is known to be involved in host cell adhesion, biofilm formation and immune evasion. We have a mucosal vaccine in development that expresses the pilus of GAS on the surface of the nonpathogenic bacterium Lactococcus lactis. To expand strain coverage, we combined seven L. lactis constructs, each expressing a different GAS pilus variant, and investigated the systemic and mucosal immune responses following immunization. Mice immunized with this combination showed specific immunoglobin G and immunoglobin A responses to the GAS pilus proteins of vaccine strains, at levels comparable to mice immunized with a single construct. Cross-reactivity to pilus proteins of nonvaccine strains was also evident. Furthermore, protective efficacy against a homologous strain of GAS in a murine nasopharyngeal colonization model was observed. Overall, this study provides further evidence for using pilus-expressing lactic acid bacteria as a vaccine to prevent upper respiratory tract GAS infections."

      "# Title: What determines and are the consequences of surveillance intensity after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair?\n# Abstract: Follow-up examinations are advised 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months and yearly thereafter by the European Collaborating Group on Stent-Graft Techniques for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair (EUROSTAR). The aim of this study was to evaluate the determinants and consequences of surveillance completeness. Patients who underwent endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair between October 1996 and August 2004 and enrolled in the EUROSTAR registry were analyzed. Two groups were compared: patients who attended all scheduled visits (group A) and those who came infrequently (group B). Odds ratios and hazard rates (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined to detect which patient characteristics and complications were associated with follow-up intensity. Of the 4,433 patients, 1,538 (35%) attended all scheduled visits until the end of follow-up (group A). Analysis of patient characteristics demonstrated that intensive visitors were more often smokers, hyperlipemic, and considered unfit for open surgery or general anesthesia. Complications during follow-up, including endoleaks (24% vs. 20%), kinking (3.5% vs. 2.5%), and migration (4.9% vs. 3.5%), appeared significantly more frequently in group A. Despite intensive follow-up of this category, still a greater proportion died (12% vs. 9%, adjusted HR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.8). After 84 months of follow-up, the cumulative survival rates in groups A and B were 71% and 74%, respectively (p < 0.0001). It seems that follow-up intensity was based on baseline patient characteristics. High-risk patients had, despite more intensive surveillance, still more complications after adjustment for patient, morphological, and center-specific characteristics. Further assessment is indicated to evaluate the effectiveness of different frequencies of surveillance visits.",

The optimal strategy involves risk stratification based on factors including aneurysm characteristics, device type, and post-procedural findings, reserving more frequent imaging for high-risk patients or those with specific complications like persistent endoleaks or sac enlargement; symptom awareness remains crucial for all patients.\n"

The current study analyzed the clinical significance of this new stage in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Subjects and Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 4045 eligible PTC patients. The patients were divided into four groups according to the extent of ETE: no ETE, ETE into perithyroidal tissue, T3b (ETE into the strap muscles), and ETE beyond the strap muscles. Differences in the clinical characteristics and prognosis of the four groups were assessed. Results: Of these 4045 patients, 2300 (56.9%) had no ETE, 1004 (24.8%) had ETE into perithyroidal tissue, 371 (9.2%) had ETE into the strap muscles, and 370 (9.1%) had ETE beyond the strap muscles. Tumor size, multifocality, lymph node metastasis (LNM), distant metastasis (DM), recurrence, and recurrence-free survival (RFS) between patients with ETE into perithyroidal tissue and patients without ETE did not show differences, but significant differences were observed between patients with T3b and patients without ETE, and only patients with ETE beyond the strap muscles had significantly worse overall survival (OS) than the other three groups. However, T3b did not independently predict worse RFS in univariable and multivariable analyses. Conclusions: T3b, distinguished from minimal ETE, may be related to larger tumor size, higher prevalence of multifocality, LNM, DM, recurrence, and worse RFS than no ETE, but it may not affect OS and may not independently predict recurrence in PTC patients.",
      "# Title: Is There a Difference Between Minimal and Gross Extension into the Strap Muscles for the Risk of Recurrence in Papillary Thyroid Carcinomas?\n# Abstract: Background: The morbidity of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is primarily related to locoregional recurrences and distant metastases. The definition of minimal extrathyroidal extension (mETE) has been recently revised. The presence of mETE does not impact mortality and is generally not considered to be a predictor for the risk of recurrence. This study aimed at comparing the risk of recurrence and the response to therapy of PTC with mETE and gross extrathyroidal extension (ETE) into the strap muscles (gETE) with low- and intermediate-risk PTC without ETE (low risk w/o ETE and intermediate risk w/o ETE, respectively) to further characterize the impact of ETE on outcomes. Methods: A total of 596 PTCs were analyzed according to the degree of ETE as well as other predictors of recurrence. Four groups of patients were compared, low risk w/o ETE (n = 251), intermediate risk w/o ETE (n = 89), mETE (n = 191), and gETE (n = 65), to determine the risk of recurrence and the response to treatment. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate associations between groups and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: The risk of recurrence was 3% in low risk w/o ETE PTC, 14% in intermediate risk w/o ETE, 14% in mETE, and 25% in gETE. The recurrence risk was increased by the presence of ETE (odds ratio [OR] = 2.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-5.85, p = 0.005) and lymph node metastases (OR = 2.44 [95% CI 1.25-4.76], p = 0.009). Patients with low-risk carcinomas w/o ETE experienced longer DFS than those with mETE (hazard ratio = 0.08 [95% CI 0.02-0.28], p < 0.001), but no significant difference was observed between intermediate risk w/o ETE, mETE, and gETE. In terms of the response to therapy, patients with gETE had higher rates of biochemical and/or structural incomplete responses within the first year of treatment (OR = 2.68 [95% CI 1.31-5.45], p = 0.007) and at the final follow-up evaluation (OR = 4.35 [95% CI 1.99-9.51], p < 0.001) compared with those with mETE. An analysis of the subgroups of microcarcinomas without lymph node metastases revealed no significant difference in DFS or the response to therapy between the low risk w/o ETE and mETE PTC groups. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that both mETE and gETE are independent risk factors for the risk of recurrence in PTC. Although gETE has a more pronounced impact on the recurrence risk and is associated with a worse response to therapy, mETE may not be associated with a low risk of recurrence. This observation suggests that patients with PTC and mETE may, in part, have an intermediate risk of recurrence and need to be followed accordingly."

In addition, a positive correlation of the level of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was determined in the patients prior to treatment. In conclusion, mild hypothermia treatment in addition to intravenous thrombolysis significantly reduced the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in patients with acute cerebral infarction and reduced inflammation, and should therefore be incorporated in clinical practice.",

A randomized, single-blind study was performed to evaluate the effects of the combination of high-dose furosemide and small-volume hypertonic saline solution (HSS) infusion in the treatment of refractory New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV CHF and a normosodic diet during follow-up. Materials and Methods One hundred seven patients (39 women and 68 men, age range 65-90 years) with refractory CHF (NYHA class IV) of different etiologies, who were unresponsive to high oral doses of furosemide, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digitalis, and nitrates, were enrolled. Inclusion criteria included an ejection fraction (EF) <35%, serum creatinine level <2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level < or =60 mg/dL, reduced urinary volume, and low natriuresis. The patients were randomized in 2 groups (single-blind). Patients in group 1 (20 women and 33 men) received an intravenous (IV) infusion of furosemide (500-1000 mg) plus HSS (150 mL of 1.4%-4.6% NACl) twice a day in 30 minutes. Patients in group 2 (19 women and 35 men) received an IV bolus of furosemide (500-1000 mg) twice a day, without HSS, during a period lasting 6 to 12 days. Both groups received IV KCl (20-40 mEq) to prevent hypokalemia. At study entry, all patients underwent a physical examination and measurement of body weight (BW), blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR), an evaluation of signs of CHF, and measurement of control levels of serum Na, K, Cl, bicarbonate, albumin, uric acid, creatinine, urea, and glycemia daily during hospitalization, and measurements of the daily output of urine for Na, K, and Cl. A chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram were obtained at study entry, during hospitalization, and at the time of discharge from the hospital. During the treatment and after discharge, the daily dietary Na intake was 120 mmol in group 1 versus 80 mmol in group 2, with a fluid intake of 1000 mL daily in both groups. An assessment of BW and 24-hour urinary volume, serum, and urinary laboratory parameters were performed daily until patients reached a compensated state, when IV furosemide was replaced with oral administration (250-500 mg/d). After discharge from the hospital, patients were observed as outpatients weekly for the first 3 months and, subsequently, once a month.",

Both groups had normal sodium (120 mmol sodium) intake. After discharge, the two groups continued to receive 120 mmol Na/day and 500-1000 mL water/day.The first group (132 C-HSS patients) had an increase in urination, a reduction in hospitalization time (4 ± 2 versus 7 ± 2 days, P < 0.01), and a reduction in hospitalization costs (2210 RMB versus 3506 RMB, P < 0.01) compared with the second group (132 without C-HSS patients). During the follow-up period (36 ± 12 months), the first group had a significantly higher average readmission time (31.84 ± 7.58 months versus 15.60 ± 6.25 months, P < 0.01) and lower mortality rate (16.5% versus 31.9%, P < 0.01).The results suggest that periodical C-HSS administration, combined with serious water restriction and a normal sodium diet, significantly reduces the hospitalization time, readmission rate, and mortality in patients with NYHA class III HF."

      "# Title: Thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications in essential thrombocythemia. A retrospective study of 103 patients.\n# Abstract: A retrospective study of 103 patients with essential thrombocythemia was carried out to evaluate the incidence of thrombohemorrhagic complications and establish whether there were any correlations between these events and clinical or laboratory data. At onset or during the course of the disease, 26 patients (25.2%) presented thrombotic and 12 (11.6%) hemorrhagic complications: among the latter, six patients had gastrointestinal bleeding during antiaggregant therapy. No significant correlations were observed between thrombohemorrhagic complications and platelet count, age, sex, platelet function, bleeding time, or therapeutic regimen. However, there was a statistically significant correlation between a positive patient history for thrombotic events and an increase in thromboses. In agreement with other authors, it is believed that the best approach in asymptomatic patients is strict surveillance without treatment. Chemotherapy and/or treatment with antiaggregant agents should be reserved for symptomatic patients or patients with a positive history for thrombotic events.",
      "# Title: Clinical course of essential thrombocythemia in 147 cases.\n# Abstract: The authors retrospectively analyzed the initial characteristics, treatment, and clinical course in 147 patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET). Median age was 60 years and the M:F ratio was 0.69. At diagnosis, 53 patients were asymptomatic; 50 patients had functional symptoms (mainly vasomotor disturbances); 27 patients had large vessel thrombosis; 27 patients had a bleeding diathesis; and seven patients had both bleeding and thrombosis. The platelet count ranged from 0.7 to 2.92 X 10(12)/l. Forty-five of the 61 tested patients (61%) had prolonged bleeding time and/or platelet hypoaggregation. Three patients had in vitro spontaneous aggregation. No significant correlations were found between hemostatic findings and in vivo bleeding or thrombosis. The incidence of bleeding, however, was higher in patients with more than 2 x 10(12)/l platelets. Of 87 karyotypes performed with banding techniques, only four were abnormal. One hundred twenty-nine patients received one or more cytoreductive agents at diagnosis or during follow-up. Sixty patients received an antiaggregating agent. First-line therapy was radiophosphorus (32P) in 22 patients; busulfan in 35 patients; and hydroxyurea in 72 patients. Hydroxyurea required continuous maintenance therapy and had to be changed to another treatment in 12 of the initial responders because of inadequate control of thrombocythemia. During follow-up, 14 treated patients experienced one or several major thrombotic events. Two untreated patients also had major thrombosis. Only one major bleeding event was seen during follow-up. Median actuarial survival was 73.5% at 7 years and only one patient progressed to acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). These results suggest that large vessel thrombosis is the main complication of ET. It appears largely unpredictable in a given patient at diagnosis but can be largely prevented by the control of thrombocythemia. Because of the low incidence of side effects of treatment in this experience, the authors believe that cytoreductive therapy is indicated in most patients with ET, as long as a group of patients with very low risk of thrombosis is not defined in prospective studies.",
      "# Title: Major vascular complications in essential thrombocythemia: a study of the predictive factors in a series of 148 patients.\n# Abstract: To determine the clinicohematological factors predictive for the appearance of major vascular complications (MVC) in patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET), 148 consecutive such patients were retrospectively assessed for the development of MVC during a median follow-up of 58.5 months. Seventy-seven patients had vascular risk factors, and 37 a history of MVC at ET diagnosis. Forty-nine MVC were registered in 33 patients during the follow-up period. The actuarial probability of MVC was 27% at 6 years in the whole series, 35.6% for patients above 60 years, and 21.4% for patients younger than 60 years, whereas only one of the 36 patients younger than 45 years had MVC. At multivariate analysis, age >60 years, history of major ischemia and hypercholesterolemia were the variables associated with an increased MVC risk. These results suggest that all ET patients above 60 years should be treated, whereas in younger patients treatment decisions should be primarily based on the existence of risk factors for MVC.",
      "# Title: Thrombosis and bleeding in myeloproliferative disorders: identification of at-risk patients with whole blood platelet aggregation studies.\n# Abstract: Seventy-five patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders were studied to investigate platelet function by simultaneous measurement of platelet aggregation by the impedance method and ATP dense granule release using a whole blood platelet lumi-aggregometer, in an attempt to identify patients at risk for thrombosis and bleeding. Thirty-nine patients had at least one abnormal result indicating platelet hyperactivity (i.e. impedance or release with one agonist being above the reference range); 16 patients had platelet hypoactivity (i.e. at least one result was below the reference range), whilst 14 had co-existence of hyper- and hypoactivity. Six patients had normal results. 20/53 patients with platelet hyperactivity (alone or mixed) had a positive history of venous and/or arterial thrombosis; in comparison, only two of the other 22 patients had a positive history. During a median follow-up of 33 months, nine patients with and one patient without platelet hyperactivity respectively developed new thrombotic events before the addition of specific therapy. A total of 50 patients with and eight patients without platelet hyperactivity respectively received specific treatment including aspirin and/or cytotoxic therapy. All but one elderly patient with platelet hyperactivity have remained free of new thrombotic events on specific therapy. Two of the 17 patients with platelet hypoactivity had major clinical bleeding. These observations highlight the need to test platelets for hyper- as well as hypo-function and suggest a useful role for routine whole blood platelet aggregation studies to identify the patients at risk for thrombosis or bleeding.",
      "# Title: Incidence, clinical features and outcome of essential thrombocythaemia in a well defined geographical area.\n# Abstract: In an attempt to characterise the clinical features, incidence and outcome of essential thrombocythaemia (ET) we report our experience in a large unselected series of patients from a well defined region. All new cases of ET in the County of Copenhagen were registered during the period 1977-98. We identified 96 cases of ET, yielding an age- and sex-adjusted annual incidence rate of 0.59/100.000 and a point-prevalence at last follow up of 11/100.000. The overall incidence rate was 0.31 and 1.00 per 100.000 population during the consecutive periods 1977-89 and 1990-98, respectively, corresponding to a 3.2-fold increase. Median age at diagnosis was 67 yr (females 68 yr, males 66 yr, range 18-87 yr), and the female to male (F/M) ratio was 2.6:1. At diagnosis, 52% of the patients displayed no ET-related symptoms and were discovered fortuitously by a routine platelet count. Forty-eight percent presented with thrombohaemorrhagic phenomena, of which microvascular disturbances of the central nervous system (CNS), extremities and skin were most frequently observed (23%). Compared to patients diagnosed after 1989, patients diagnosed before 1990 had a significantly higher mean platelet count, white blood cell (WBC) count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) value and alkaline phosphatase value. With a median follow up of 70 months, 5-yr survival was 76%, significantly lower than the expected survival of an age- and sex-matched control group (p = 0.0052). Thirty-seven patients experienced a total of 55 thrombohaemorrhagic events during follow-up, corresponding to an incidence of thrombosis and microvascular disturbances or haemorrhage of 8.1% per pt-yr and 2.5% per pt-yr, respectively. The number of patients experiencing thrombosis or microvascular disturbances was significantly higher among the 29 patients who never received acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) compared to the 67 patients who received ASA during follow up (45% vs. 21%; p = 0.017). This study provides population-based data suggesting the benefit of treatment with low-dose ASA in a non-selected population of patients with ET.",

      "# Title: Frequency and risk factors for thrombosis in idiopathic myelofibrosis: analysis in a series of 155 patients from a single institution.\n# Abstract: Thrombosis is a frequent complication of polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia, but its incidence and predisposing factors in idiopathic myelofibrosis (IM) are unknown. In 18 (11.6%) of 155 patients diagnosed with IM in a single institution, 31 thrombotic events (19 arterial, 12 venous) were registered after a mean follow-up of 4.2 (s.d.: 4.5) years. In six patients, the thrombosis was simultaneous to or appeared a few months before IM diagnosis and 14 had one or more thrombotic episodes. When compared with the general population, a significant increase was observed in the incidence of venous thrombosis (odds ratio 17.5, 95% confidence interval: 10.3-31.4). At multivariate analysis, the initial variables associated with an increased risk of thrombosis were thrombocytosis (platelets >450 x 10(9)/l, P=0.001), presence of one cardiovascular risk factor (arterial hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes, P=0.003), cellular phase of myelofibrosis (P=0.005), and Hb >11 g/dl (P=0.02). Considering post-diagnosis events, the 5-year thrombosis-free survival probability was 90.4% in the series, 80.6% for patients with platelets >450 x 10(9)/l, 82.6% for patients with one cardiovascular risk factor, and 85.1% for those in cellular phase. These results indicate an increased thrombotic risk for IM patients with hyperproliferative features and/or coexistent cardiovascular risk factors.",

      "# Title: Leukocytosis is a risk factor for thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia: interaction with treatment, standard risk factors, and Jak2 mutation status.\n# Abstract: Leukocytes contribute to the pathogenesis of thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia (ET) through recently discovered mechanisms of activation and interaction with platelets and endothelial cells. To evaluate whether an increased leukocyte count was associated with thrombosis and whether this effect can be modulated by therapy, we analyzed the clinical course of 439 patients with ET followed at the Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo. The strength of the association was measured at diagnosis or before thrombotic events by multivariable analyses carried out using data at baseline as well as time-varying covariates. The results showed that (1) an increased leukocyte count at diagnosis was associated with thrombosis during follow-up (\"baseline analysis,\" relative risk [RR] 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-3.9, P = .001); (2) hydroxyurea (HU) lowered leukocytosis and reduced the strength of the association between leukocytosis and thrombosis (\"time-dependent analysis,\" RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.9-2.0, not significant [NS]); (3) the association of leukocytosis and thrombosis was more evident in untreated low-risk patients (RR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-6.4, P = .01) compared with HU-treated high-risk patients (RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.8-3.2, NS); and (4) the presence of JAK2 V617F was not identified as a risk factor for thrombosis during follow-up despite a significant association between the mutation and leukocytosis. We suggest validation of these findings in prospective clinical studies.",
      "# Title: Clinical profile of homozygous JAK2 617V>F mutation in patients with polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia.\n# Abstract: JAK2 617V>F mutation occurs in a homozygous state in 25% to 30% of patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and 2% to 4% with essential thrombocythemia (ET). Whether homozygosity associates with distinct clinical phenotypes is still under debate. This retrospective multicenter study considered 118 JAK2 617V>F homozygous patients (104 PV, 14 ET) whose clinical characteristics were compared with those of 587 heterozygous and 257 wild-type patients. Irrespective of their clinical diagnosis, homozygous patients were older, displayed a higher leukocyte count and hematocrit value at diagnosis, and presented larger spleen volume. Aquagenic pruritus was significantly more common among homozygous PV patients. JAK2 617V>F homozygosity associated with more frequent evolution into secondary myelofibrosis in both PV and ET. After adjustment for sex, age, leukocyte count, and previous thrombosis in a multivariate analysis, homozygous ET patients displayed a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio [HR] 3.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-11.7; P = .013) than wild-type (HR = 1.0) or heterozygous patients (HR = 1.49). No significant association of JAK2 617V>F homozygosity with thrombosis risk was observed in PV. Finally, JAK2 617V>F homozygous patients were more likely to receive chemotherapy for control of disease. We conclude that JAK2 617V>F homozygosity identifies PV or ET patients with a more symptomatic myeloproliferative disorder and is associated with a higher risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with ET.",
      "# Title: Vascular events in Korean patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and their relationship to JAK2 mutation.\n# Abstract: Evaluation of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F mutation has been widely used for the diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). However, its prognostic relevance to clinical outcome is not completely understood. We investigated the association of JAK2 V617F with vascular events in Korean patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). We studied 283 patients from 15 centers, who were diagnosed with MPN. The JAK2 V617F status was evaluated by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. The patients' diagnoses were essential thrombocythemia (ET n = 146), polycythemia vera (PV n = 120), primary myelofibrosis (n = 12), and unclassifiable MPN (MPNu n = 5). JAK2 V617F was detected in 89 (61%) patients with ET, 103 (86%) with PV, four (33%) with myelofibrosis, and four (80%) with MPNu. A higher number of leukocytes, haemoglobin levels and BM cellularity as well as an older age, lower platelet counts, and diagnosis of PV were significantly correlated with JAK2 V617F. Eighty-three and 43 episodes of thrombosis and bleeding occurred in 100 patients each before and after the diagnosis. Vascular events more frequently occurred in 37% of patients with JAK2 V617F than in 29% of those without the mutation (p = 0.045). Among 175 patients whose samples were available for sequencing, 28 patients with homozygous JAK2 V617F had vascular events more frequently (57%) than those who were heterozygotes (39%) or had the wild type (27%) (p = 0.03). The multivariate analysis showed that a JAK2 homozygous mutation, hypercholesterolemia and older age were independent risk factors for a vascular event. The results of this study showed that Korean patients with MPN had a similar JAK2 mutation rate and frequency of vascular events when compared to Western patients. The presence of V617F was significantly related to vascular events. Therefore, initial evaluation for the JAK2 mutation and careful monitoring for vascular events should be performed in MPN patients.",
      "# Title: Thrombosis in primary myelofibrosis: incidence and risk factors.\n# Abstract: We assessed frequency and predictive factors for major cardiovascular (CV) events in 707 patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) followed in 4 European institutions. A total of 236 deaths (33%) were recorded for an overall mortality of 7.7% patient-years (pt-yr). Fatal and nonfatal thromboses were registered in 51 (7.2%) patients, with a rate of 1.75% pt-yr. If deaths from non-CV causes were considered as competing events, we estimated that the adjusted rate of major thrombotic events would have been 2.2% pt-yr. In a multivariable model, age older than 60 years (hazard ratio [HR], 2.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-4.39, P = .01) and JAK2 mutational status (HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.10-3.34; P = .02) were significantly associated with thrombosis, whereas the strength of the association between leukocyte count higher than 15 x 10(9)/L and CV events was of borderline significance (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 0.97-2.72; P = .06). The highest incidence of fatal and nonfatal thrombosis was observed when the mutation was present along with leukocytosis (3.9% pt-yr; HR, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.26-7.81). This study is the largest hitherto carried out in this setting and shows that the rate of major CV events in PMF is comparable with that reported in essential thrombocythemia, and it is increased in aged patients and those with JAK2 V617F mutation and leukocytosis.",
      "# Title: Thrombosis in myelofibrosis: prior thrombosis is the only predictive factor and most venous events are provoked.\n# Abstract: In a retrospective analysis of 205 patients (median age 62 years) with primary myelofibrosis and known JAK2V617F mutational status, 13.2% experienced a vaso-occlusive event at or prior to their diagnosis. After a median follow up of 31 months, post-diagnosis thrombosis occurred in 22 patients (10.7%), including 9 (4.4%) and 16 (7.8%) patients with a total of 9 arterial and 24 venous events, respectively. The majority (71%) of the venous events were temporally associated with other exogenous risk factors for thrombosis such as surgery, line placement or hormonal therapy. On multivariable analysis that included age, JAK2V617F mutation status and leukocyte count as covariates, history of thrombosis was the only predictive variable in general (P=0.04) or when arterial (P=0.007) and venous (P=0.02) thromboses were analyzed separately.

Recently, also leukocytosis has been proposed in risk stratification of ET patients. We report a retrospective study on 532 ET patients followed for a median of 7.6 years. Sixty-four patients (12%) developed 95 thrombotic events during follow-up. Together with the high-risk condition, a white blood cell (WBC) value above 11 × 10⁹/L, corresponding to the fourth percentile value, significantly correlated with a higher thrombotic risk (p = 0.033) by Cox proportional hazards. Moreover, the cumulative risk of thrombosis was significantly higher in high-risk patients with WBC >11 × 10⁹/L. JAK2 V617F mutation did not correlate with thrombosis. Overall, 123 (23%) patients died. Three independent parameters were noted as prognostic factors for survival in multivariate analysis: age > 60 years, leukocytosis >11 × 10⁹/L, and hemoglobin level below normal values. Based on these parameters, three groups of risk were defined, with significantly different survivals. Baseline leukocytosis correlated with a higher thrombotic risk in high-risk patients and identified a cohort of patients with worse survival.",
      "# Title: Incidence and risk factors for bleeding in 1104 patients with essential thrombocythemia or prefibrotic myelofibrosis diagnosed according to the 2008 WHO criteria.\n# Abstract: In an international study of 1104 patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET), a histological review according to the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria confirmed ET in 891 patients (WHO-ET, 81%), and revised the diagnosis to prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis (PMF) in 180 patients (PMF, 16%). Major bleeding during follow-up occurred in 55 (6%) WHO-ET and 21 (12%) PMF patients (P = 0.009), at a rate of 0.79 and 1.39% patients per year, respectively, (P = 0.039). In a multivariable analysis, predictors of bleeding included diagnosis of PMF (P = 0.05; hazard ratio (HR) 1.74), leukocytosis (P = 0.04; HR 1.74), previous hemorrhage (P = 0.025; HR 2.35) and aspirin therapy (P=0.001; HR 3.16). The analysis restricted to patients with WHO-ET confirmed previous hemorrhage (P = 0.043; HR 1.92) and aspirin (P=0.027; HR 2.24) as independent risk factors. The current study reveals that major bleeding associated with thrombocytosis might be relatively specific to PMF, as opposed to WHO-defined ET. Furthermore, it shows that low-dose aspirin exacerbates these hemorrhagic events of PMF. In contrast, thrombocytosis per se was not a risk factor for bleeding; however, low-dose aspirin had a synergistic hemorrhagic effect unmasking the bleeding tendency of patients with extreme thrombocytosis. These observations carry significant therapeutic implications in these two WHO entities.",
      "# Title: Leukocytosis as an important risk factor for arterial thrombosis in WHO-defined early/prefibrotic myelofibrosis: an international study of 264 patients.\n# Abstract: We aimed to determine risk factors for thrombotic events in early/prefibrotic myelofibrosis diagnosed according to the World Health Organization criteria. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was calculated on a total number of 264 patients derived from an international database. After a median follow-up of 6.28 years, 42 (15.9%) patients experienced arterial (n = 31) or venous thrombosis (n = 11). A higher leukocyte count correlated with an increased risk for total thrombosis and in particular, with an increased risk for arterial thrombosis (P = 0.005, HR 1.15 and P = 0.047, HR 1.12, respectively). A platelet count above 870 × 10⁹/L was associated with a lower risk for total thrombosis and also for venous thrombosis (P = 0.022, HR 0.44 and P = 0.027, HR 0.19). Moreover, a lower hemoglobin level was associated with an increased risk for venous thrombosis (P = 0.007, HR 0.59). Our data indicate that leukocytosis is a prominent risk factor for thrombosis in early/prefibrotic MF.",

      "# Title: Thromboses and hemorrhages are common in MPN patients with high JAK2V617F allele burden.\n# Abstract: The most common causes of morbidity and mortality in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications. The JAK2V617F mutation, commonly found in MPN, correlates with several clinical and laboratory characteristics even if the relevance of JAK2V617F allele burden in the natural history of these diseases is unclear. In this study we searched, a relation between thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications and JAK2V617F allele burden level in MPN patients. We evaluated 253 consecutive MPN [121 essential thrombocythemia (ET), 124 polycythemia vera (PV), and 8 primary myelofibrosis (PMF)] patients in whom the JAK2V617F allele burden was available, all studied and followed (median 8.8 years) in our department. Patients were stratified accordingly to their JAK2V617F allele burden, into four quartiles (1st <25%, 2nd 26-50%, 3rd 51-75%, and 4th >75%). Significantly higher incidence of thromboses (p = 0.001) and hemorrhages (p < 0.001) during follow-up has been observed in higher quartiles when compared to lower ones. Thrombosis- and hemorrhage-free survivals were poorer in patients belonging to the highest quartile. Our data suggest that MPN patients with JAK2V617F allele burden higher than 75% have to be considered as high risk patients, being prone to develop thrombo-hemorrhagic complications during the disease course.",
      "# Title: Risk factors for arterial versus venous thrombosis in polycythemia vera: a single center experience in 587 patients.\n# Abstract: In a recent International Working Group on Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) study, prior arterial events and hypertension were predictors of subsequent arterial thrombosis whereas prior venous events and age ≥65 years predicted venous thrombosis in polycythemia vera (PV). In the current study, we sought to validate the above findings and identify additional predictors of arterial versus venous thrombosis. At a median follow up of 109 months, thrombosis after diagnosis occurred in 128 (22%) patients; 82 (14%) arterial and 57 (10%) venous events. On multivariate analysis, prior arterial events (<0.0001), hyperlipidemia (p = 0.03), and hypertension (p = 0.02) predicted subsequent arterial events. In comparison, prior venous events (p = 0.05), leukocytosis ≥11 × 109/L (p = 0.002), and major hemorrhage (p = 0.02) were predictors of subsequent venous events. Salient associations with arterial thrombosis included age ≥ 60 years, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and normal karyotype whereas age ≤ 60 years, females, palpable splenomegaly and history of major hemorrhage were associated with venous thrombosis. TET2 or ASXL1 mutations did not impact arterial nor venous thrombosis. In conclusion, we identify distinct associations for arterial versus venous thrombosis in PV and confirm that a prior arterial or venous thrombotic event is the most reliable predictor of subsequent events.",
      "# Title: Evaluation of vascular events in patients with myeloproliferative syndromes and mutations of either the januskinase-2 or calreticulin gene at the university hospital Krems from 2008 to 2015.\n# Abstract: Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), classified as polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis (ET) and myelofibrosis (MF) are stem-cell derived disorders. Mutations in either the januskinase-2 (JAK-2) or the calreticulin (CALR) gene are characteristic for MPN and may result in enhanced proliferation of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets, and thus increase the risk for vascular events. This study is a retrospective and descriptive analysis of records of patients, who underwent treatment for myeloproliferative syndromes at the Department of Hemato-Oncology of the University hospital Krems from 2008 to the end of 2015. Out of 250 patients, who were suspected for MPN, 51 patients displayed a JAK-2 V617F mutation. These were analyzed with regard to their blood values, gender, age at diagnosis, therapy and vascular events before and after diagnosis (during therapy). Of the 51 patients diagnosed with MPN and a JAK-2 V617F mutation, 33 suffered from PV, 15 from ET and 3 from MF. More men than women were diagnosed with MPN and the median age at diagnosis was 72 years. Acetylsalicylic acid, phlebotomy and Hydroxyurea were the most frequent therapies applied. In our study cohort, the most common vascular events were acute coronary syndrome and transitory ischemic attack. Thromboembolic events were effectively reduced by MPN therapy while no elevation in bleeding events could be observed.",
      "# Title: Clinico-hematological profile and thrombotic/hemorrhagic events in 150 chinese patients with essential thrombocythemia.\n# Abstract: Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is an uncommon chronic myeloproliferative disorder with no cure. Patients with ET are at risk of different complications, and currently there are no optimal prognostic standards to predict severe post-diagnosis complications such as thrombosis and hemorrhage. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the full set of clinical data from 150 Chinese patients with ET enrolled from 2013 to 2016. We discovered that neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), along with other known clinical parameters such as age, leukocyte count, incidence of thrombotic events is higher in patients with JAK2 V617F mutation. NLR is also higher in patients at high-risk stratification of thrombosis. Multivariate analysis showed that age (P = 0.001, 95% CI 1.023-1.089) and JAK2 V617F mutation (P = 0.003, 95% CI 1.837-21.035) were independent factors for thrombotic events, while age (P = 0.005, 95% CI 1.019-1.111) was the only predictive factor for hemorrhagic events at diagnosis. For future thrombotic events, multivariate analysis revealed NLR as the best predictive parameter (P < 0.001, 95% CI 1.173-1.486) when compared with other clinical parameters such as age (P = 0.037, 95% CI 1.004-1.126), thrombosis at diagnosis (P = 0.036, 95% CI 1.077-9.099) and WBC count (P = 0.047, 95% CI 1.001-1.109). Further ROC curve and Kaplan Meier analysis validated NLR as better prognostic marker for future thrombotic events and thrombosis-free survival. In summary, our data suggest that NLR parameter may possess great prognostic significance for future thrombosis in ET patients."

      "conclusionB": "**Primary Concluding Statement:**\n\nAmong patients with Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), including essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), there is a significantly increased risk of both thrombosis and hemorrhage. Key risk factors identified across multiple studies include older age (particularly >60 years), history of prior vascular events (thrombotic or hemorrhagic), leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count), JAK2 V617F mutation status (especially homozygosity in ET), and specific disease characteristics like cellular phase in myelofibrosis or high platelet counts in ET. Low-dose aspirin is associated with a reduced risk of thrombosis in ET, though it may increase bleeding risk, particularly in PMF. Interventions like cytoreductive therapy and antiplatelet agents are used to mitigate these risks, and specific risk stratification models (e.g., IPSET, IPSET-Thrombosis) have been developed to guide management."

      "# Title: Cytological diagnostic features of late breast implant seromas: From reactive to anaplastic large cell lymphoma.\n# Abstract: Late breast implant seroma may be the presentation of a breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BI-ALCL), which claims for a prompt recognition. However, BI-ALCL diagnosis on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) might be challenging for pathologists lacking experience with peri-implant breast effusions. Sixty-seven late breast implant seromas collected by FNA from 50 patients were evaluated by Papanicolaou smear stain and immunocytochemistry on cell blocks. A diagnostic algorithm based on the cellular composition, cell morphology and percentage of CD30+ cells was developed. Histological evaluation of the corresponding peri-prosthetic capsules was also performed. Most of the effusions (91% of the samples) were classified as reactive and 9% as BI-ALCL. In the BI-ALCL cases, medium-to-large atypical cells expressing CD30 represented more than 70% of the cellularity, whereas in in the reactive effusions CD30+ elements were extremely rare (<5%) and consisted of non-atypical elements. The reactive effusions were categorized into three patterns: i) acute infiltrate with prominent neutrophilic component (33% of the samples); ii) mixed infiltrate characterized by a variable number of neutrophils, lymphocytes and macrophages (30% of the samples); iii) chronic infiltrate composed predominantly of T lymphocytes or macrophages with only sporadic granulocytes (37% of the samples). The inflammatory cytological patterns were consistent with the histology of the corresponding capsules. Our results indicate that cytological analysis of late breast implant effusions, supported by the knowledge of the heterogeneous cytomorphological spectrum of late seromas, is a valuable approach for the early recognition of BI-ALCL.",

Its etiology unknown, one hypothesis suggests an initiating inflammatory stimulus, possibly infectious, triggers BIA-ALCL. We analyzed microbiota of breast, skin, implant and capsule in BIA-ALCL patients (n = 7), and controls via culturing methods, 16S rRNA microbiome sequencing, and immunohistochemistry. Alpha and beta diversity metrics and relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria were calculated, and phylogenetic trees constructed. Staphylococcus spp., the most commonly cultured microbes, were identified in both the BIA-ALCL and contralateral control breast. The diversity of bacterial microbiota did not differ significantly between BIA-ALCL and controls for any material analyzed. Further, there were no significant differences in the relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria between BIA-ALCL and control specimens. Heat maps suggested substantial diversity in the composition of the bacterial microbiota of the skin, breast, implant and capsule between patients with no clear trend to distinguish BIA-ALCL from controls. While we identified no consistent differences between patients with BIA-ALCL-affected and contralateral control breasts, this study provides insights into the composition of the breast microbiota in this population.",

We investigated whether bacteria could trigger the activation and multiplication of BIA-ALCL cells in vitro. BIA-ALCL patient-derived BIA-ALCL tumor cells, BIA-ALCL cell lines, cutaneous ALCL cell lines, an immortal T-cell line (MT-4), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from BIA-ALCL, capsular contracture, and primary augmentation patients were studied. Cells were subjected to various mitogenic stimulation assays including plant phytohemagglutinin (PHA), Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Staphylococcal superantigens enterotoxin A (SEA), toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), or sterilized implant shells. Patient-derived BIA-ALCL tumor cells and BIA-ALCL cell lines showed a unique response to LPS stimulation. This response was dampened significantly in the presence of a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) inhibitor peptide. In contrast, cutaneous ALCL cells, MT-4, and PBMC cells from all patients responded significantly more to PHA, SEA, and TSST-1 than to LPS. Breast implant shells of all surface grades alone did not produce a proliferative response of BIA-ALCL cells, indicating the breast implant does not act as a pro-inflammatory stimulant. These findings indicate a possible novel pathway for LPS to promote BIA-ALCL cell proliferation via a TLR4 receptor-mediated bacterial transformation of T-cells into malignancy."

We examined WFA+ -M2BP levels in patients with F4 (cirrhosis), F3 or more (advanced fibrosis) and F2 or more (significant fibrosis) in the two groups. We further examined the relationship between five fibrosis markers and the degree of fibrosis. The WFA+ -M2BP values ranged from 0.25 cut-off index (COI) to 12.9 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 0.34-20.0 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P<.0001). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F4 in the two groups were 2.83 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 5.03 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P=.0046). The median WFA+ -M2BP values in F3 or more in the two groups were 1.79 COI in patients with hepatitis B and 3.79 COI in patients with hepatitis C (P<.0001).

Consecutive adult NAFLD patients who had a liver biopsy were included. Serum WFA+-M2BP level was measured using a lectin-antibody sandwich immunoassay using a chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay machine (HISCL-5000, Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). The measured levels were indexed using the following equation: Cut-off index (COI) = ([WFA+-M2BP]sample-[WFA+-M2BP]NC) / ([WFA+-M2BP]PC-[WFA+-M2BP]NC), where PC = positive control and NC = negative control. Histopathological examination of liver biopsy specimen was reported according to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Clinical Research Network Scoring System. Data for 220 cases were analyzed. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of NASH was 0.65. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of steatosis grade ≥2 and 3 was 0.64 and 0.53, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of lobular inflammation grade ≥1, ≥2 and 3 was 0.57, 0.68 and 0.59, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of hepatocyte ballooning grade ≥1 and 2 was 0.64 and 0.65, respectively. The AUROC of the COI for the diagnosis of fibrosis stage ≥1, ≥2, ≥3 and 4 was 0.61, 0.71, 0.74 and 0.84, respectively. Out of the 220 cases, 152 cases were the same 76 patients who had a repeat liver biopsy after 48 weeks of intervention. The AUROC of the change in the COI to detect improvement in steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning and fibrosis was 0.57, 0.54, 0.59 and 0.52, respectively. In conclusion, serum WFA+-M2BP was most useful for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in NAFLD patients. However, it was less useful for differentiating NASH from non-NASH, and for diagnosis and follow-up of the individual histopathological components of NASH.",

We assessed its efficacy in evaluating liver disease severity in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in Taiwan. The association between WFA+-M2BP and histological features was evaluated among those CHC patients underwent liver biopsy. We also aimed to clarify the factors determining the performance of WFA+-M2BP in CHC. A total of 229 CHC patients were consecutively recruited. The mean value of WFA+-M2BP in patients from F0 to F4 was 1.68, 2.23, 3.45, 3.48, 3.77 respectively (linear trend P = 0.008). Linear regression analysis revealed that alanine aminotransferase (odds ratio [OR]: 0.03, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.02-0.05, P < 0.001), AST (OR: -0.1, 95% CI: -0.02 to -0.01, P < 0.001), and liver fibrosis (OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.01-0.59, P = 0.043) were the independent factors correlated to serum WFA+-M2BP level. The optimal cutoff values of WFA+-M2BP for fibrosis stages F1, F2, F3, and F4 were 1.42, 1.61, 1.42, and 2.67, respectively.

      "# Title: Comparison of serum fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B.\n# Abstract: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The diagnosis of liver fibrosis has a key role in selecting patients with CHB for antiviral treatment. However, serum biomarkers demonstrate limited diagnostic utility. The present study aimed to compare the performances of fibrosis biomarkers for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB and to identify the most appropriate biomarker for these patients. The current study included 96 antiviral-naïve patients with CHB who underwent liver biopsy. METAVIR scoring system was used to assess liver fibrosis and necroinflammation. The diagnostic performances were evaluated of the platelet (PLT) count; the levels of hyaluronan, serum 7S domain of type 4 collagen, procollagen type III N-terminal peptide, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1, Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) and N-terminal type III collagen propeptide (Pro-C3); the fibrosis index based on four factors; the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index; and enhanced liver fibrosis score for identifying significant liver fibrosis [≥fibrosis stage 2 (F2)]. All fibrosis biomarkers, except the Pro-C3 level, correlated with the fibrosis stage. M2BPGi was better than other biomarkers for diagnosing ≥F2, with the highest area under the curve of 0.902. M2BPGi demonstrated a higher diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis than mild/severe fibrosis or cirrhosis. However, no significant correlation was observed between the M2BPGi level and fibrosis stage in patients with CHB having significant liver necroinflammation defined as ≥ necroinflammatory activity 2. The M2BPGi level and PLT count were exclusively correlated with the fibrosis stage in 73 patients without significant liver necroinflammation. M2BPGi demonstrated the highest diagnostic performance for significant fibrosis in patients having significant liver fibrosis with no significant liver necroinflammation. In conclusion, the M2BPGi level can accurately diagnose significant liver fibrosis that indicates the need for antiviral therapy in patients with CHB.",

      "# Title: Serum Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2-binding protein expression predicts disease severity in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients.\n# Abstract: The role of Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein (WFA+ -M2BP) in the prediction of disease severity in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains elusive. This study evaluated the performance of WFA+ -M2BP in predicting fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. A total of 80 patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) were enrolled. Serum WFA+ -M2BP levels were measured using standard methods. The fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index was also measured. The mean values of WFA+ -M2BP were 1.0, 1.0, 0.8, and 2.2 in Metavir fibrosis stage F0, F1, F2, and F3-4, respectively (linear trend p = 0.005). The optimal cut-off value of WFA+ -M2BP in predicting advanced fibrosis (F3-4) was 1.37 cut-off index (COI), yielding the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, and accuracy of 75.0, 79.4, 39.1, 94.7, and 78.7%, respectively (p < 0.001). Combining WFA+ -M2BP with FIB-4 significantly increased the diagnostic performance for advanced fibrosis, yielding specificity, PPV, and accuracy of 100, 100, and 93%, respectively. The significant factors predicting advanced liver fibrosis in the multivariate regression analysis were WFA+ -M2BP ≥ 1.37 COI (OR/confidence interval [CI]: 9.49/1.63-55.21, p = 0.01) and FIB-4 ≥ 2.80 (OR/CI: 38.18/4.89-297.93, p = 0.001).

Although current data intimate a potential contributory role for biofilms, these assertions remain uncorroborated. This observed data scarcity necessitates further targeted, rigorous scientific inquiry to either validate or refute the role of biofilms in the complex etiological framework of BIA-ALCL. Such forthcoming research could serve as a critical juncture in not only clarifying this enigmatic relationship but also in advancing our collective understanding of the disease, with implications for enhanced screening protocols and pre-surgical guidelines. Given the inconclusive nature of extant findings, further empirical scrutiny is both warranted and exigent.

      "# Title: Cytological diagnostic features of late breast implant seromas: From reactive to anaplastic large cell lymphoma.\n# Abstract: Late breast implant seroma may be the presentation of a breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BI-ALCL), which claims for a prompt recognition. However, BI-ALCL diagnosis on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) might be challenging for pathologists lacking experience with peri-implant breast effusions. Sixty-seven late breast implant seromas collected by FNA from 50 patients were evaluated by Papanicolaou smear stain and immunocytochemistry on cell blocks. A diagnostic algorithm based on the cellular composition, cell morphology and percentage of CD30+ cells was developed. Histological evaluation of the corresponding peri-prosthetic capsules was also performed. Most of the effusions (91% of the samples) were classified as reactive and 9% as BI-ALCL. In the BI-ALCL cases, medium-to-large atypical cells expressing CD30 represented more than 70% of the cellularity, whereas in in the reactive effusions CD30+ elements were extremely rare (<5%) and consisted of non-atypical elements. The reactive effusions were categorized into three patterns: i) acute infiltrate with prominent neutrophilic component (33% of the samples); ii) mixed infiltrate characterized by a variable number of neutrophils, lymphocytes and macrophages (30% of the samples); iii) chronic infiltrate composed predominantly of T lymphocytes or macrophages with only sporadic granulocytes (37% of the samples). The inflammatory cytological patterns were consistent with the histology of the corresponding capsules. Our results indicate that cytological analysis of late breast implant effusions, supported by the knowledge of the heterogeneous cytomorphological spectrum of late seromas, is a valuable approach for the early recognition of BI-ALCL.",

Its etiology unknown, one hypothesis suggests an initiating inflammatory stimulus, possibly infectious, triggers BIA-ALCL. We analyzed microbiota of breast, skin, implant and capsule in BIA-ALCL patients (n = 7), and controls via culturing methods, 16S rRNA microbiome sequencing, and immunohistochemistry. Alpha and beta diversity metrics and relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria were calculated, and phylogenetic trees constructed. Staphylococcus spp., the most commonly cultured microbes, were identified in both the BIA-ALCL and contralateral control breast. The diversity of bacterial microbiota did not differ significantly between BIA-ALCL and controls for any material analyzed. Further, there were no significant differences in the relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria between BIA-ALCL and control specimens. Heat maps suggested substantial diversity in the composition of the bacterial microbiota of the skin, breast, implant and capsule between patients with no clear trend to distinguish BIA-ALCL from controls. While we identified no consistent differences between patients with BIA-ALCL-affected and contralateral control breasts, this study provides insights into the composition of the breast microbiota in this population.",

We investigated whether bacteria could trigger the activation and multiplication of BIA-ALCL cells in vitro. BIA-ALCL patient-derived BIA-ALCL tumor cells, BIA-ALCL cell lines, cutaneous ALCL cell lines, an immortal T-cell line (MT-4), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from BIA-ALCL, capsular contracture, and primary augmentation patients were studied. Cells were subjected to various mitogenic stimulation assays including plant phytohemagglutinin (PHA), Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Staphylococcal superantigens enterotoxin A (SEA), toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), or sterilized implant shells. Patient-derived BIA-ALCL tumor cells and BIA-ALCL cell lines showed a unique response to LPS stimulation. This response was dampened significantly in the presence of a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) inhibitor peptide. In contrast, cutaneous ALCL cells, MT-4, and PBMC cells from all patients responded significantly more to PHA, SEA, and TSST-1 than to LPS. Breast implant shells of all surface grades alone did not produce a proliferative response of BIA-ALCL cells, indicating the breast implant does not act as a pro-inflammatory stimulant. These findings indicate a possible novel pathway for LPS to promote BIA-ALCL cell proliferation via a TLR4 receptor-mediated bacterial transformation of T-cells into malignancy."

Between January 2010 and June 2015, 132 patients underwent chemotherapy were eligible for assessment. Based on our patients' data, the cut-off value of NLR was 2.78 according to receiver operating characteristic curve.

      "# Title: Expression of a hepatitis A virus antigen in Lactococcus lactis and Escherichia coli and evaluation of its immunogenicity.\n# Abstract: An epidemic shift in Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection has been observed in recent years in rapidly developing countries, with increasing numbers of severe adult cases which has led to renewed interest in vaccination. Our approach in vaccine development uses recombinant expression of the highly immunogenic HAV antigen VP1-P2a in food-grade lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis and in Escherichia coli. We used genetic constructs that enable nisin-controlled expression of the antigen in L. lactis in three different forms: (a) intracellularly, (b) on the bacterial surface and (c) on the bacterial surface fused with the fragment of the E. coli flagellin molecule that can act as a molecular adjuvant. Expression of the two surface forms of the antigen was achieved in L. lactis, and the resulting antigen-displaying bacteria were administered orally to mice. Half the animals in each of the two groups developed specific IgGs, with titers increasing over time and reaching 1:422 without flagellin and 1:320 with flagellin. A much higher titer 1:25,803 was observed with the parenterally administered antigen, which was purified from E. coli. With the latter, a significant mucosal IgA response was also observed. Despite significant titers, the IgGs elicited with oral or parenteral administration could not prevent HAV from infecting cells in a virus neutralization assay, suggesting that the antibodies cannot recognize viral surface epitopes. Nevertheless, orally administered HAV antigen expressed in L. lactis elicited significant systemic humoral immune response showing the feasibility for development of effective HAV vaccine for mucosal delivery.",
      "# Title: Oral immunization with recombinant Lactococcus lactis delivering a multi-epitope antigen CTB-UE attenuates Helicobacter pylori infection in mice.\n# Abstract: Urease is an essential virulence factor and colonization factor for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and is considered as an excellent vaccine candidate antigen. However, conventional technologies for preparing an injectable vaccine require purification of the antigenic protein and preparation of an adjuvant. Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 (L. lactis) could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of edible vaccine. In previous study, we constructed a multi-epitope vaccine, designated CTB-UE, which is composed of the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), three Th cell epitopes and two B-cell epitopes from urease subunits. To develop a novel type of oral vaccine against H. pylori, genetically modified L. lactis strains were established to secrete this epitope vaccine extracellularly in this study. Oral prophylactic immunization with recombinant L. lactis significantly elicited humoral anti-urease antibody responses (P < 0.001) and reduced the gastric colonization of H. pylori from 7.14 ± 0.95 to 4.68 ± 0.98 log10 CFU g(-1) stomach. This L. lactis oral vaccine offers a promising vaccine candidate for the control of H. pylori infection.",
      "# Title: Development of a new DNA vaccine based on mycobacterial ESAT-6 antigen delivered by recombinant invasive Lactococcus lactis FnBPA+.\n# Abstract: The use of the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis as a vehicle for the oral delivery of DNA vaccine plasmids constitutes a promising strategy for vaccination. The delivery of DNA plasmids into eukaryotic cells is of critical importance for subsequent DNA expression and effectiveness of the vaccine. In this context, the use of the recombinant invasive L. lactis FnBPA+ (fibronectin-binding protein A) strain for the oral delivery of the eukaryotic expression vector vaccination using lactic acid bacteria (pValac), coding for the 6-kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6) gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, could represent a new DNA vaccine strategy against tuberculosis. To this end, the ESAT-6 sequence was cloned into the pValac vector; the L. lactis fibronectin-binding protein A (FnBPA)+ (pValac:ESAT-6) strain was obtained, and its immunological profile was checked in BALB/c mice. This strain was able to significantly increase interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production in spleen cells, showing a systemic T helper 1 (Th1) cell response. The mice also showed a significant increase in specific secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) production in colon tissue and fecal extracts. Thus, this is the first time that L. lactis has been used to deliver a plasmid DNA harboring a gene that encodes an antigen against tuberculosis through mucous membranes.",
      "# Title: Lactococcus lactis displayed neuraminidase confers cross protective immunity against influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Influenza A viruses pose a serious threat to public health. Current influenza A vaccines predominantly focus on hemagglutinin (HA) and show strain-specific protection. Neuraminidase (NA) is much less studied in the context of humoral immunity against influenza A viruses. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cross protective immunity of NA presented on Lactococcus lactis (L.lactis) surface against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in the mouse model. L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA was constructed in which pgsA was used as an anchor protein. Mice vaccinated orally with L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA could elicit significant NA-specific serum IgG and mucosa IgA antibodies, as well as neuraminidase inhibition (NI) titers. Importantly, L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA provided 80% protection against H5N1, 60% protection against H3N2 and H1N1, respectively. These findings suggest that recombinant L.lactis/pNZ110-pgsA-NA in the absence of adjuvant via oral administration can be served as an effective vaccine candidate against diverse strains of influenza A viruses.",
      "# Title: Broadly protective immunity against divergent influenza viruses by oral co-administration of Lactococcus lactis expressing nucleoprotein adjuvanted with cholera toxin B subunit in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines need to be annually reformulated to well match the predicated circulating strains. Thus, it is critical for developing a novel universal influenza vaccine that would be able to confer cross-protection against constantly emerging divergent influenza virus strains. Influenza virus A is a genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses. Influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) is a structural protein which encapsidates the negative strand viral RNA, and anti-NP antibodies play role in cross-protective immunity. Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) is an ideal vaccine delivery vehicle via oral administration route. However, L. lactis vectored vaccine exhibits poor immunogenicity without the use of mucosal adjuvant. To enhance the immunogenicity of L. lactis vectored vaccine, cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit, one of mucosal adjuvants, is a safe adjuvant for oral route, when combined with L. lactis vectored vaccine. In this study, we hypothesized that pNZ8008, a L. lactis expression plasmid, encoding NP antigen, would be able to elicit cross-protection with the use of CTB via oral administration route.",
      "# Title: Cross-protection of Lactococcus lactis-displayed HA2 subunit against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines provide strain-specific protection against homologous subtypes and need to be updated annually. Therefore, it is essential to develop a universal vaccine that would induce broadly cross-protective immunity against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses. The highly conserved HA2 subunit is a promising candidate for developing a universal influenza vaccine. Here, we hypothesized that the HA2 subunit could be displayed on the surface of Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis), using Spax as an anchor protein (L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2) and that L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 would have immunogenicity by oral administration without the use of adjuvant in the mouse model. To address this hypothesis, we show that oral vaccination of mice with L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 elicited significant humoral and mucosal immune responses. Importantly, L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 provided 100% protection against homologous H5N1 or heterologous H1N1 virus challenge. These results suggest that an HA2 subunit presented on the surface of L. lactis is an effective universal vaccine candidate against influenza A viruses in the poultry industry and in humans.",
      "# Title: Oral Immunization with a Recombinant Lactococcus lactis-Expressing HIV-1 Antigen on Group A Streptococcus Pilus Induces Strong Mucosal Immunity in the Gut.\n# Abstract: The induction of a potent humoral and cellular immune response in mucosal tissue is important for the development of an effective HIV vaccine. Most of the current HIV vaccines under development use the i.m. route for immunization, which is relatively poor in generating potent and long-lived mucosal immune responses. In this article, we explore the ability of an oral vaccination with a probiotic organism, Lactococcus lactis, to elicit HIV-specific immune responses in the mucosal and systemic compartments of BALB/c mice. We expressed the HIV-1 Gag-p24 on the tip of the T3 pilus of Streptococcus pyogenes as a fusion to the Cpa protein (LL-Gag). After four monthly LL-Gag oral immunizations, we observed strong Gag-specific IgG and IgA responses in serum, feces, and vaginal secretions. However, the Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses in the blood were at or below our detection limit. After an i.m. modified vaccinia Ankara/Gag boost, we observed robust Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses both in systemic and in mucosal tissues, including intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes of the small intestine, Peyer's patches, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Consistent with strong immunogenicity, the LL-Gag induced activation of CD11c(+) CD11b(+) dendritic cells in the Peyer's patches after oral immunization. Our results demonstrate that oral immunization with L. lactis expressing an Ag on the tip of the group A Streptococcus pilus serves as an excellent vaccine platform to induce strong mucosal humoral and cellular immunity against HIV.",

      "# Title: Production and delivery of Helicobacter pylori NapA in Lactococcus lactis and its protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity.\n# Abstract: Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein A subunit (NapA) has been identified as a virulence factor, a protective antigen and a potent immunomodulator. NapA shows unique application potentials for anti-H. pylori vaccines and treatment strategies of certain allergic diseases and carcinomas. However, appropriate production and utilization modes of NapA still remain uncertain to date. This work has established a novel efficient production and utilization mode of NapA by using L. lactis as an expression host and delivery vector, and demonstrated immune protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity of the engineered L. lactis by oral vaccination of mice. It was observed for the first time that H. pylori NapA promotes both polarized Th17 and Th1 responses, which may greatly affect the clinical application of NapA. This report offers a promising anti-H. pylori oral vaccine candidate and a potent mucosal immune modulatory agent. Meanwhile, it uncovers a way to produce and deliver the oral vaccine and immunomodulator by fermentation of food like milk, which might have striking effects on control of H. pylori infection, gastrointestinal cancers, and Th2 bias allergic diseases, including many food allergies.",
      "# Title: Protective immunity induced by an intranasal multivalent vaccine comprising 10 Lactococcus lactis strains expressing highly prevalent M-protein antigens derived from Group A Streptococcus.\n# Abstract: Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) causes diseases ranging from mild pharyngitis to severe invasive infections. The N-terminal fragment of streptococcal M protein elicits protective antibodies and is an attractive vaccine target. However, this N- terminal fragment is hypervariable: there are more than 200 different M types. In this study, an intranasal live bacterial vaccine comprising 10 strains of Lactococcus lactis, each expressing one N-terminal fragment of M protein, has been developed. Live bacterial-vectored vaccines cost less to manufacture because the processes involved are less complex than those required for production of protein subunit vaccines. Moreover, intranasal administration does not require syringes or specialized personnel. Evaluation of individual vaccine types (M1, M2, M3, M4, M6, M9, M12, M22, M28 and M77) showed that most of them protected mice against challenge with virulent S. pyogenes. All 10 strains combined in a 10-valent vaccine (M×10) induced serum and bronchoalveolar lavage IgG titers that ranged from three- to 10-fold those of unimmunized mice. After intranasal challenge with M28 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice was significantly higher than that of unimmunized mice. In contrast, when mice were challenged with M75 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice did not differ significantly from that of unimmunized mice. Mx-10 immunized mice had significantly less S. pyogenes in oropharyngeal washes and developed less severe disease symptoms after challenge than did unimmunized mice. Our L. lactis-based vaccine may provide an alternative solution to development of broadly protective group A streptococcal vaccines.",
      "# Title: Mucosal and systemic immune responses elicited by recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a fusion protein composed of pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin from Bordetella pertussis.\n# Abstract: We constructed a food-grade expression system harboring a F1S1 fusion protein of Bordetella pertussis to be produced in Lactococcus lactis NZ3900 as a new oral vaccine model against whooping cough, caused by B. pertussis. F1S1 was composed of N-terminally truncated S1 subunit of pertussis toxin and type I immunodominant domain of filamentous hemagglutinin which are both known as protective immunogens against pertussis. The recombinant L. lactis was administered via oral or intranasal routes to BALB/c mice and the related specific systemic and mucosal immune responses were then evaluated. The results indicated significantly higher levels of specific IgA in the lung extracts and IgG in sera of mucosally-immunized mice, compared to their controls. It was revealed that higher levels of IgG2a, compared to IgG1, were produced in all mucosally-immunized mice. Moreover, immunized mice developed Th1 responses with high levels of IFN-γ production by the spleen cells. These findings provide evidence for L. lactis to be used as a suitable vehicle for expression and delivery of F1S1 fusion protein to mucosa and induction of appropriate systemic and mucosal immune responses against pertussis.",
      "# Title: Rotavirus VP6 protein mucosally delivered by cell wall-derived particles from Lactococcus lactis induces protection against infection in a murine model.\n# Abstract: Rotaviruses are the primary cause of acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide. Although the implementation of live attenuated vaccines has reduced the number of rotavirus-associated deaths, variance in their effectiveness has been reported in different countries. This fact, among other concerns, leads to continuous efforts for the development of new generation of vaccines against rotavirus.In this work, we describe the obtention of cell wall-derived particles from a recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a cell wall-anchored version of the rotavirus VP6 protein. After confirming by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, flow cytometry and electronic immunomicroscopy that these particles were carrying the VP6 protein, their immunogenic potential was evaluated in adult BALB/c mice. For that, mucosal immunizations (oral or intranasal), with or without the dmLT [(double mutant Escherichia coli heat labile toxin LT(R192G/L211A)] adjuvant were performed. The results showed that these cell wall-derived particles were able to generate anti-rotavirus IgG and IgA antibodies only when administered intranasally, whether the adjuvant was present or not. However, the presence of dmLT was necessary to confer protection against rotavirus infection, which was evidenced by a 79.5 percent viral shedding reduction.In summary, this work describes the production of cell wall-derived particles which were able to induce a protective immune response after intranasal immunization. Further studies are needed to characterize the immune response elicited by these particles as well as to determine their potential as an alternative to the use of live L. lactis for mucosal antigen delivery.",
      "# Title: Extracellular overproduction of E7 oncoprotein of Iranian human papillomavirus type 16 by genetically engineered Lactococcus lactis.\n# Abstract: We aimed at constructing Lactococcus lactis strains expressing HPV-16 recombinant E7 (rE7) oncoprotein and examining its overproduction ability followed by optimizing batch and fed-batch fermentations. Thereafter, in order to assess the immunogenicity of recombinant L. lactis cells, C57BL/6 mice were immunized by oral gavage.",
      "# Title: A Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB)-Based Vaccine Candidate for Human Norovirus.\n# Abstract: Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are responsible for more than 95% of the non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis epidemics in the world. The CDC estimates that every year 21 million individuals suffer from HuNoV-induced gastroenteritis in the United States. Currently, there is no FDA-approved vaccine for HuNoVs. Development of an effective vaccine has been hampered by the lack of an efficient cell culture system for HuNoVs and a suitable small animal model for pathogenesis study. In this study, we developed lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as a vector to deliver HuNoV antigen. A LAB strain (Lactococcus lactis) carrying VP1 gene of a HuNoV GII.4 virus (LAB-VP1) was constructed. It was found that HuNoV VP1 protein was highly expressed by LAB vector and was secreted into media supernatants. To test whether LAB-based HuNoV vaccine candidate is immunogenic, 4-day-old gnotobiotic piglets were orally inoculated with various doses of LAB-VP1. It was found that LABs were persistent in the small intestine of piglets and shed in pig feces for at least 25 days post inoculation. LAB DNA and VP1 were detected in mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen tissue in LAB-VP1 inoculated groups. HuNoV-specific IgG and IgA were detectable in serum and feces respectively at day 13 post-inoculation, and further increased at later time points. After being challenged with HuNoV GII.4 strain, a large amount of HuNoV antigens were observed in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum sections of the intestine in the LAB control group. In contrast, significantly less, or no, HuNoV antigens were detected in the LAB-VP1 immunized groups. Collectively, these results demonstrate that a LAB-based HuNoV vaccine induces protective immunity in gnotobiotic piglets.",

      "# Title: Mucosal Vaccination with Lactococcus lactis-Secreting Surface Immunological Protein Induces Humoral and Cellular Immune Protection against Group B Streptococcus in a Murine Model.\n# Abstract: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the primary etiological agent of sepsis and meningitis in newborns and is associated with premature birth and stillbirth. The development of a licensed vaccine is one of the pending challenges for the World Health Organization. Previously, we showed that oral immunization with surface immune protein (SIP) decreases vaginal colonization of GBS and generates functional opsonizing antibodies, which was determined by opsonophagocytic assays (OPA) in vitro. We also showed that the protein has an adjuvant vaccine profile. Therefore, an oral vaccine based on SIP may be an attractive alternative to employ in the development of new vaccines against GBS. Lactococcus lactis is a highlighted oral vaccine probiotic inducer of the mucosal immune response. This bacterium could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of an edible vaccine and has been used in clinical trials. In this study, we showed that an oral vaccine with a recombinant L. lactis strain secreting SIP from GBS (rL. lactis-SIP) can induce protective humoral and cellular immunity in an experimental model of GBS vaginal colonization in C57BL/6 mice. Mice immunized with rL. lactis-SIP were protected against clinical symptoms and bacterial colonization after GBS vaginal colonization. Our rL. lactis-SIP vaccine also induces an increase of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) specifically against SIP. The adoptive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice to naïve mice generated protection against GBS vaginal colonization. Moreover, the rL. lactis-SIP strain induces the activation of SIP-specific T cells, which could decrease GBS vaginal colonization and generate protective antibodies when transferred to other mice. Our experimental observations strongly support the notion that rL. lactis-SIP induces protective humoral and cellular immunity and could be considered as a novel alternative in the development of vaccines for GBS.",
      "# Title: Recombinant Lactococcus Lactis Displaying Omp31 Antigen of Brucella melitensis Can Induce an Immunogenic Response in BALB/c Mice.\n# Abstract: Since Brucella infection mostly occurs through the mucosal surfaces, immune response induced by vaccine that is delivered by a way of mucosal route can be drastically enhanced to control the brucellosis. Omp31is the major outer membrane protein of Brucella, and is considered as a protective antigen against Brucella infection. Accordingly, Lactococcus lactis has been used as an antigen-delivering vector to develop a vaccine-induced mucosal response for having a safer vaccination against brucellosis. A designed omp31 gene fused to the usp45 signal peptide and M6 cell wall anchor was sub cloned in the pNZ7021 expression vector, and a recombinant L. lactis displaying Omp31 was constructed. Omp31 protein expression was confirmed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. Animals were orally and intraperitoneally immunized with live or killed L. lactis expressing Omp31, respectively. The humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated by measuring the specific cytokines and antibodies. sIgA, serum IgA, IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in the mice immunized with live recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31 and also serum IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in mice immunized with killed recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31. Among IgG subtypes, IgG2a response was significantly higher in both groups compared to IgG1. In mice groups immunized with recombinant L. lactis, the IFN-γ and IL-10 level elevated; however, there was no change in the level of IL-4. These results indicated that recombinants L. lactis induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, and also vaccines based on L. lactis-derived live carriers are promising interventions against Brucella melitensis infections.",
      "# Title: Lactococcus lactis FNBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) Induces Cellular and Humoral Immune Responses After Oral Immunization of Mice.\n# Abstract: The development of a new vaccine strategy against tuberculosis is urgently needed and has been greatly encouraged by the scientific community worldwide. In this work, we constructed a lactococcal DNA vaccine based on the fusion of two Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens, ESAT-6 and Ag85A, and examined its immunogenicity. The coding sequences of the ESAT-6 and Ag85A genes were fused and cloned into the eukaryotic expression pValac vector, and the functionality of the vector was confirmed in vitro. Then, L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) was obtained and used for oral immunization of mice. This strain induced significant increases in IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-17 cytokines in stimulated splenocyte cultures, and significant production of antigen-specific sIgA was observed in the colonic tissues of immunized mice. We demonstrated that L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) generated a cellular and humoral immune response after oral immunization of mice. The strategy developed in this work may represent an interesting DNA mucosal vaccine candidate against tuberculosis, using the fusion of two highly immunogenic antigens delivered by safe lactic acid bacteria.",
      "# Title: Protective Immunity Against Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli by Oral Vaccination of Engineered Lactococcus lactis.\n# Abstract: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the leading causes of diarrhea in children globally, and thus suitable vaccines are desired. Antigen display on lactic acid bacteria is a reliable approach for efficient oral vaccination and preventing bowel diseases. To develop an oral vaccine against ETEC, the gene of the binding domain from heat-labile toxin (LTB), a key ETEC virulence factor, was codon-optimized and cloned into a construct containing a signal peptide and an anchor for display on L. lactis. Bioinformatics analysis showed a codon adaptation index of 0.95 for the codon-optimized gene. Cell surface expression of LTB was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and blotting. White New Zealand rabbits were immunized per os (PO) with the recombinant L. lactis, and the antibody titers were assayed with ELISA. In vitro neutralization assay was performed using mouse adrenal tumor cells and rabbit ileal loop test was performed as the in vivo assay. ELISA results indicated that oral administration of the engineered L. lactis elicited a significant production of IgA in the intestine. In vitro neutralization assay showed that the effect of the toxin could be neutralized with 500 µg/ml of IgG isolated from the oral vaccine group. Furthermore, the dose of ETEC causing fluid accumulation in the ileal loop test showed a tenfold increase in rabbits immunized with either recombinant L. lactis or LTB protein compared to other groups. Our results imply that recombinant L. lactis could potentially be an effective live oral vaccine against ETEC toxicity.",
      "# Title: Oral Immunization of Mice with Cell Extracts from Recombinant Lactococcus lactis Expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein.\n# Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all over the world and became a pandemic that named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). At present, several intramuscular vaccines have been successfully developed and mass vaccination has progressed in many countries. The aim of the study is to develop and examine an oral vaccine against COVID-19 with recombinant Lactococcus lactis IL1403, a strain of lactic acid bacteria, expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) S1 subunit as an immunizing antigen. PBS or cell extracts from recombinant L. lactis were orally administered into mice (control VS treatment), and formation of antigen-specific antibodies and changes in the gut microbiome were analyzed. Intracellular antigen was detected, but its secretion was not successful. After immunization, antigen-specific serum IgG and fecal IgA levels were 1.5-fold (P = 0.002) and 1.4-fold (P = 0.016) higher in the immunized mice (treatment) than control, respectively. Gut microbiome profiles were clearly separated between the two groups when analyzed for beta diversity with overall similarity. At the genus level, while Coprococcus (P = 0.036) and unclassified genus of Ruminococcaceae (P = 0.037) in treatment were more abundant than control, rc4-4 (P = 0.013) and Stenotrophomonas (P = 0.021) were less abundant. Our results indicate that cell extract containing SARS-CoV-2 antigen can induce mice to produce antigen-specific antibodies without overall changes in the gut microbiome. This strategy may be useful for the development of other oral viral vaccines.",
      "# Title: Oral Immunization With a M Cell-Targeting Recombinant L. Lactis Vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE Stimulate Protective Immunity Against H. Pylori in Mice.\n# Abstract: There are many virulence factors of H. pylori that contribute in diverse ways to gastric disease. Therefore, designing multivalent epitope vaccines against many key virulence factors virulence factors of H. pylori is a promising strategy to control H. pylori infection. In previous studies, we constructed a multivalent epitope vaccine FVpE against four key virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), and oral immunization with the FVpE vaccine plus a polysaccharide adjuvant (PA) containing lycium barbarum polysaccharide and chitosan could provide protection against H. pylori infection in the Mongolian gerbil model. Oral vaccines have many advantages over injected vaccines, such as improved safety and compliance, and easier manufacturing and administration. However, the harsh gastrointestinal (GI) environment, such as gastric acid and proteolytic enzymes, limits the development of oral vaccines to some extent. Oral vaccines need a gastrointestinal delivery system with high safety, low price and promoting vaccine antigen to stimulate immune response in the gastrointestinal mucosa. Lactic acid bacteria are gastrointestinal probiotics that have unique advantages as a delivery system for oral vaccines. In this study, a M cell-targeting surface display system for L. lactis named plSAM was designed to help vaccine antigens to stimulate effective immune responses in the gastrointestinal tract, and a M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE was constructed by using the surface display system plSAM. recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE could secretively express the SAM-FVpE protein and display it on the bacterial surface. Moreover, experimental results confirmed that LL-plSAM-FVpE had an enhanced M cell-targeting property. In addition, LL-plSAM-FVpE had excellent M cell-targeting property to promote the phagocytosis and transport of the antigen SAM-FVpE by gastrointestinal M cells. More importantly, oral immunization of LL-plSAM-FVpE or SAM-FVpE plus PA can stimulate IgG and sIgA antibodies and CD4+ T cell immune responses against four virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), thus providing protective immunity against H. pylori infection in mice. The M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine against various key H. pylori virulence factors could be a promising vaccine candidate for controlling H. pylori infection.",
      "# Title: Oral and intranasal immunization with food-grade recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing high conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein triggers mice's immunity responses.\n# Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic began at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread throughout the world. Vaccination is still the most effective method of prevention of pathogenic infections, including viral infections. However, there is little evidence that vaccination can protect against SARS-CoV-2 virus for a long time. Thus, regular re-vaccination is necessary to control COVID-19. Vaccination by injection is invasive, and is one of the reasons people refuse to get re-vaccinated. Therefore, we developed a less invasive vaccine based on oral or nasal administration. The gene encoding the high conserved region (HCR) spike protein was inserted into pNZ8149 and expressed in L.lactis NZ3900. Mice were immunized at 3-week intervals with oral or nasal routes. Anti-SARS-CoV2 spike antibody (IgG and IgA) level were measured using ELISA method before and after treatment. Plasma cells population in lymph were analyzed using flowcytometry and the CD4 + and CD8 + cells in lymph and intestine were analyzed using immunofluorescence method. The results of nasal and oral administration in experimental animals showed that L.lactis carrying the HCR gene could induce a humoral immune response, as indicated by increased levels of IgG and IgA against SARS-CoV-2 (IgG/IgA-SARS-CoV-2). The plasma cell population after nasal and oral vaccination in mice were significantly different with control group (p < 0.05). The CD4 + and CD8 + cells in intestine were significantly higher in orally immunized group mice than control group. The CD8 + cells in lymph were significantly higher in intranasal immunized group mice than control group. Our data demonstrate L.lactis expressing spike protein can be developed into a less invasive alternative to nasal and oral vaccination.",
      "# Title: Expanding strain coverage of a group A Streptococcus pilus-expressing Lactococcus lactis mucosal vaccine.\n# Abstract: Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a human pathogenic bacterium that can trigger a wide range of diseases, including the autoimmune diseases acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, causing major morbidity and mortality in many low- and middle-income countries. Primary intervention programs have had limited success thus far, and a licensed vaccine has yet to be developed. The pilus of GAS is known to be involved in host cell adhesion, biofilm formation and immune evasion. We have a mucosal vaccine in development that expresses the pilus of GAS on the surface of the nonpathogenic bacterium Lactococcus lactis. To expand strain coverage, we combined seven L. lactis constructs, each expressing a different GAS pilus variant, and investigated the systemic and mucosal immune responses following immunization. Mice immunized with this combination showed specific immunoglobin G and immunoglobin A responses to the GAS pilus proteins of vaccine strains, at levels comparable to mice immunized with a single construct. Cross-reactivity to pilus proteins of nonvaccine strains was also evident. Furthermore, protective efficacy against a homologous strain of GAS in a murine nasopharyngeal colonization model was observed. Overall, this study provides further evidence for using pilus-expressing lactic acid bacteria as a vaccine to prevent upper respiratory tract GAS infections."

      "# Title: Genome-wide survey reveals predisposing diabetes type 2-related DNA methylation variations in human peripheral blood.\n# Abstract: Inter-individual DNA methylation variations were frequently hypothesized to alter individual susceptibility to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Sequence-influenced methylations were described in T2DM-associated genomic regions, but evidence for direct, sequence-independent association with disease risk is missing. Here, we explore disease-contributing DNA methylation through a stepwise study design: first, a pool-based, genome-scale screen among 1169 case and control individuals revealed an excess of differentially methylated sites in genomic regions that were previously associated with T2DM through genetic studies. Next, in-depth analyses were performed at selected top-ranking regions. A CpG site in the first intron of the FTO gene showed small (3.35%) but significant (P = 0.000021) hypomethylation of cases relative to controls. The effect was independent of the sequence polymorphism in the region and persists among individuals carrying the sequence-risk alleles. The odds of belonging to the T2DM group increased by 6.1% for every 1% decrease in methylation (OR = 1.061, 95% CI: 1.032-1.090), the odds ratio for decrease of 1 standard deviation of methylation (adjusted to gender) was 1.5856 (95% CI: 1.2824-1.9606) and the sensitivity (area under the curve = 0.638, 95% CI: 0.586-0.690; males = 0.675, females = 0.609) was better than that of the strongest known sequence variant. Furthermore, a prospective study in an independent population cohort revealed significant hypomethylation of young individuals that later progressed to T2DM, relative to the individuals who stayed healthy. Further genomic analysis revealed co-localization with gene enhancers and with binding sites for methylation-sensitive transcriptional regulators. The data showed that low methylation level at the analyzed sites is an early marker of T2DM and suggests a novel mechanism by which early-onset, inter-individual methylation variation at isolated non-promoter genomic sites predisposes to T2DM.",
      "# Title: DNA methylation profiling identifies epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetic patients.\n# Abstract: In addition to genetic predisposition, environmental and lifestyle factors contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Epigenetic changes may provide the link for translating environmental exposures into pathological mechanisms. In this study, we performed the first comprehensive DNA methylation profiling in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We uncovered 276 CpG loci affiliated to promoters of 254 genes displaying significant differential DNA methylation in diabetic islets. These methylation changes were not present in blood cells from T2D individuals nor were they experimentally induced in non-diabetic islets by exposure to high glucose. For a subgroup of the differentially methylated genes, concordant transcriptional changes were present. Functional annotation of the aberrantly methylated genes and RNAi experiments highlighted pathways implicated in β-cell survival and function; some are implicated in cellular dysfunction while others facilitate adaptation to stressors. Together, our findings offer new insights into the intricate mechanisms of T2D pathogenesis, underscore the important involvement of epigenetic dysregulation in diabetic islets and may advance our understanding of T2D aetiology.",

      "# Title: Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of human pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic donors identifies candidate genes that influence insulin secretion.\n# Abstract: Impaired insulin secretion is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Epigenetics may affect disease susceptibility. To describe the human methylome in pancreatic islets and determine the epigenetic basis of T2D, we analyzed DNA methylation of 479,927 CpG sites and the transcriptome in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We provide a detailed map of the global DNA methylation pattern in human islets, β- and α-cells. Genomic regions close to the transcription start site showed low degrees of methylation and regions further away from the transcription start site such as the gene body, 3'UTR and intergenic regions showed a higher degree of methylation. While CpG islands were hypomethylated, the surrounding 2 kb shores showed an intermediate degree of methylation, whereas regions further away (shelves and open sea) were hypermethylated in human islets, β- and α-cells. We identified 1,649 CpG sites and 853 genes, including TCF7L2, FTO and KCNQ1, with differential DNA methylation in T2D islets after correction for multiple testing. The majority of the differentially methylated CpG sites had an intermediate degree of methylation and were underrepresented in CpG islands (∼ 7%) and overrepresented in the open sea (∼ 60%). 102 of the differentially methylated genes, including CDKN1A, PDE7B, SEPT9 and EXOC3L2, were differentially expressed in T2D islets. Methylation of CDKN1A and PDE7B promoters in vitro suppressed their transcriptional activity. Functional analyses demonstrated that identified candidate genes affect pancreatic β- and α-cells as Exoc3l silencing reduced exocytosis and overexpression of Cdkn1a, Pde7b and Sept9 perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion in clonal β- and α-cells, respectively. Together, our data can serve as a reference methylome in human islets. We provide new target genes with altered DNA methylation and expression in human T2D islets that contribute to perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion. These results highlight the importance of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of T2D.",
      "# Title: Altered DNA methylation and differential expression of genes influencing metabolism and inflammation in adipose tissue from subjects with type 2 diabetes.\n# Abstract: Genetics, epigenetics, and environment may together affect the susceptibility for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our aim was to dissect molecular mechanisms underlying T2D using genome-wide expression and DNA methylation data in adipose tissue from monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D and independent case-control cohorts. In adipose tissue from diabetic twins, we found decreased expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation; carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism; and increased expression of genes involved in inflammation and glycan degradation. The most differentially expressed genes included ELOVL6, GYS2, FADS1, SPP1 (OPN), CCL18, and IL1RN. We replicated these results in adipose tissue from an independent case-control cohort. Several candidate genes for obesity and T2D (e.g., IRS1 and VEGFA) were differentially expressed in discordant twins. We found a heritable contribution to the genome-wide DNA methylation variability in twins. Differences in methylation between monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D were subsequently modest. However, 15,627 sites, representing 7,046 genes including PPARG, KCNQ1, TCF7L2, and IRS1, showed differential DNA methylation in adipose tissue from unrelated subjects with T2D compared with control subjects. A total of 1,410 of these sites also showed differential DNA methylation in the twins discordant for T2D. For the differentially methylated sites, the heritability estimate was 0.28. We also identified copy number variants (CNVs) in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D. Taken together, subjects with T2D exhibit multiple transcriptional and epigenetic changes in adipose tissue relevant to the development of the disease.",
      "# Title: An integrated epigenomic analysis for type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci in monozygotic twins.\n# Abstract: DNA methylation has a great potential for understanding the aetiology of common complex traits such as Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here we perform genome-wide methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) in whole-blood-derived DNA from 27 monozygotic twin pairs and follow up results with replication and integrated omics analyses. We identify predominately hypermethylated T2D-related differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and replicate the top signals in 42 unrelated T2D cases and 221 controls. The strongest signal is in the promoter of the MALT1 gene, involved in insulin and glycaemic pathways, and related to taurocholate levels in blood. Integrating the DNA methylome findings with T2D GWAS meta-analysis results reveals a strong enrichment for DMRs in T2D-susceptibility loci. We also detect signals specific to T2D-discordant twins in the GPR61 and PRKCB genes. These replicated T2D associations reflect both likely causal and consequential pathways of the disease. The analysis indicates how an integrated genomics and epigenomics approach, utilizing an MZ twin design, can provide pathogenic insights as well as potential drug targets and biomarkers for T2D and other complex traits.",

      "# Title: Novel epigenetic determinants of type 2 diabetes in Mexican-American families.\n# Abstract: Although DNA methylation is now recognized as an important mediator of complex diseases, the extent to which the genetic basis of such diseases is accounted for by DNA methylation is unknown. In the setting of large, extended families representing a minority, high-risk population of the USA, we aimed to characterize the role of epigenome-wide DNA methylation in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Using Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays, we tested for association of DNA methylation at 446 356 sites with age, sex and phenotypic traits related to T2D in 850 pedigreed Mexican-American individuals. Robust statistical analyses showed that (i) 15% of the methylome is significantly heritable, with a median heritability of 0.14; (ii) DNA methylation at 14% of CpG sites is associated with nearby sequence variants; (iii) 22% and 3% of the autosomal CpG sites are associated with age and sex, respectively; (iv) 53 CpG sites were significantly associated with liability to T2D, fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance; (v) DNA methylation levels at five CpG sites, mapping to three well-characterized genes (TXNIP, ABCG1 and SAMD12) independently explained 7.8% of the heritability of T2D (vi) methylation at these five sites was unlikely to be influenced by neighboring DNA sequence variation. Our study has identified novel epigenetic indicators of T2D risk in Mexican Americans who have increased risk for this disease. These results provide new insights into potential treatment targets of T2D.",

      "# Title: Epigenome-wide association study identifies TXNIP gene associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and sustained hyperglycemia.\n# Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is an established risk factor for a wide range of vascular diseases, including ischemic stroke (IS). Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a marker for average blood glucose levels over the previous 12 weeks, is used as a measure of glycemic control and also as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes (HbA1c levels ≥ 6.5%). Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, may be associated with aging processes and with modulation of the risk of various pathologies, such as DM. Specifically, DNA methylation could be one of the mechanisms mediating the relation between DM and environmental exposures. Our goal was to identify new CpG methylation sites associated with DM. We performed a genome-wide methylation study in whole-blood DNA from an IS patient cohorts. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array was used to measure DNA methylation in CpG sites. All statistical analyses were adjusted for sex, age, hyperlipidemia, body mass index (BMI), smoking habit and cell count. Findings were replicated in two independent cohorts, an IS cohort and a population-based cohort, using the same array. In the discovery phase (N = 355), we identified a CpG site, cg19693031 (located in the TXNIP gene) that was associated with DM (P = 1.17 × 10(-12)); this CpG was replicated in two independent cohorts (N = 167 and N = 645). Methylation of TXNIP was inversely and intensely associated with HbA1c levels (P = 7.3 × 10(-16)), specifically related to diabetic patients with poor control of glucose levels. We identified an association between the TXNIP gene and DM through epigenetic mechanisms, related to sustained hyperglycemia levels (HbA1c ≥ 7%).",

Here we examine whether age-related epigenetic changes affect human islet function and if blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect these changes and associate with future T2D. We analyse DNA methylation genome-wide in islets from 87 non-diabetic donors, aged 26-74 years. Aging associates with increased DNA methylation of 241 sites. These sites cover loci previously associated with T2D, for example, KLF14. Blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related methylation changes in 83 genes identified in human islets (for example, KLF14, FHL2, ZNF518B and FAM123C) and some associate with insulin secretion and T2D. DNA methylation correlates with islet expression of multiple genes, including FHL2, ZNF518B, GNPNAT1 and HLTF. Silencing these genes in β-cells alter insulin secretion. Together, we demonstrate that blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related DNA methylation changes in human islets, and associate with insulin secretion in vivo and T2D.",

To conduct a genome-wide DNA methylation in individuals with type 2 diabetes, individuals with prediabetes, and control mixed ancestry individuals from South Africa. Methods. We used peripheral blood to perform genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in 3 individuals with screen detected diabetes, 3 individuals with prediabetes, and 3 individuals with normoglycaemia from the Bellville South Community, Cape Town, South Africa, who were age-, gender-, body mass index-, and duration of residency-matched. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) was performed by Arraystar Inc. (Rockville, MD, USA). Results. Hypermethylated DMRs were 1160 (81.97%) and 124 (43.20%), respectively, in individuals with diabetes and prediabetes when both were compared to subjects with normoglycaemia. Our data shows that genes related to the immune system, signal transduction, glucose transport, and pancreas development have altered DNA methylation in subjects with prediabetes and diabetes. Pathway analysis based on the functional analysis mapping of genes to KEGG pathways suggested that the linoleic acid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism pathways are hypomethylated in prediabetes and diabetes. Conclusions. Our study suggests that epigenetic changes are likely to be an early process that occurs before the onset of overt diabetes. Detailed analysis of DMRs that shows gradual methylation differences from control versus prediabetes to prediabetes versus diabetes in a larger sample size is required to confirm these findings.",
      "# Title: Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing of Human Pancreatic Islets Reveals Novel Differentially Methylated Regions in Type 2 Diabetes Pathogenesis.\n# Abstract: Current knowledge about the role of epigenetics in type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains limited. Only a few studies have investigated DNA methylation of selected candidate genes or a very small fraction of genomic CpG sites in human pancreatic islets, the tissue of primary pathogenic importance for diabetes. Our aim was to characterize the whole-genome DNA methylation landscape in human pancreatic islets, to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in diabetic islets, and to investigate the function of DMRs in islet biology. Here, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, which is a comprehensive and unbiased method to study DNA methylation throughout the genome at a single nucleotide resolution, in pancreatic islets from donors with T2D and control subjects without diabetes. We identified 25,820 DMRs in islets from individuals with T2D. These DMRs cover loci with known islet function, e.g., PDX1, TCF7L2, and ADCY5 Importantly, binding sites previously identified by ChIP-seq for islet-specific transcription factors, enhancer regions, and different histone marks were enriched in the T2D-associated DMRs. We also identified 457 genes, including NR4A3, PARK2, PID1, SLC2A2, and SOCS2, that had both DMRs and significant expression changes in T2D islets. To mimic the situation in T2D islets, candidate genes were overexpressed or silenced in cultured β-cells. This resulted in impaired insulin secretion, thereby connecting differential methylation to islet dysfunction. We further explored the islet methylome and found a strong link between methylation levels and histone marks. Additionally, DNA methylation in different genomic regions and of different transcript types (i.e., protein coding, noncoding, and pseudogenes) was associated with islet expression levels. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the islet DNA methylome in individuals with and without diabetes and highlights the importance of epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets and T2D pathogenesis."

Moreover, R18 effectively reduced brain edema in animal models of stroke. All of the mentioned effects were supported by a moderate level of evidence.

      "# Title: Therapeutic effects of a reducible poly (oligo-D-arginine) carrier with the heme oxygenase-1 gene in the treatment of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.\n# Abstract: Non-viral carriers for gene therapy have been developed to minimize carrier cytotoxicity and to enhance transfection efficiency. Previously, we synthesized a 9-arginine-based reducible high molecular weight peptide for gene delivery. For the reducible poly(oligo-D-arginines) (rPOA), 9-arginine oligopeptides are connected by internal disulfide linkages to produce a high molecular weight peptide. In this study, rPOA was evaluated as a carrier of the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene for the treatment of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) -induced brain stroke. An in vitro transfection assay showed that rPOA had higher transfection efficiency and lower toxicity than polyethylenimine (PEI). For in vivo evaluation, I/R rat models were produced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). rPOA/HO-1 expression plasmid (pHO-1) polyplexes were injected into the brain at 1 h before MCAO, and HO-1 expression levels in the brain were then measured by ELISA. The results indicated that rPOA/pHO-1 polyplexes had higher transfection efficiencies than PEI/pHO-1 polyplexes. The rPOA/pHO-1 polyplexes significantly reduced infarct volumes. In addition, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) was reduced in the rPOA/pHO-1 polyplex injection group, suggesting that HO-1 had an anti-inflammatory effect, while the PEI/pHO-1 polyplex did not show this effect. These results suggest that rPOA is a potential non-viral vector for HO-1 gene therapy to protect brain cells from I/R-related neuronal injury including stroke.",
      "# Title: Poly-arginine and arginine-rich peptides are neuroprotective in stroke models.\n# Abstract: Using cortical neuronal cultures and glutamic acid excitotoxicity and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) stroke models, we demonstrated that poly-arginine and arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), are highly neuroprotective, with efficacy increasing with increasing arginine content, have the capacity to reduce glutamic acid-induced neuronal calcium influx and require heparan sulfate preotoglycan-mediated endocytosis to induce a neuroprotective effect. Furthermore, neuroprotection could be induced with immediate peptide treatment or treatment up to 2 to 4 hours before glutamic acid excitotoxicity or OGD, and with poly-arginine-9 (R9) when administered intravenously after stroke onset in a rat model. In contrast, the JNKI-1 peptide when fused to the (non-arginine) kFGF CPP, which does not rely on endocytosis for uptake, was not neuroprotective in the glutamic acid model; the kFGF peptide was also ineffective. Similarly, positively charged poly-lysine-10 (K10) and R9 fused to the negatively charged poly-glutamic acid-9 (E9) peptide (R9/E9) displayed minimal neuroprotection after excitotoxicity. These results indicate that peptide positive charge and arginine residues are critical for neuroprotection, and have led us to hypothesize that peptide-induced endocytic internalization of ion channels is a potential mechanism of action. The findings also question the mode of action of different neuroprotective peptides fused to arginine-rich CPPs.",

      "# Title: The R18 Polyarginine Peptide Is More Effective Than the TAT-NR2B9c (NA-1) Peptide When Administered 60 Minutes after Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in the Rat.\n# Abstract: We examined the dose responsiveness of polyarginine R18 (100, 300, and 1000 nmol/kg) when administered 60 minutes after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The TAT-NR2B9c peptide, which is known to be neuroprotective in rodent and nonhuman primate stroke models, served as a positive control. At 24 hours after MCAO, there was reduced total infarct volume in R18 treated animals at all doses, but this reduction only reached statistical significance at doses of 100 and 1000 nmol/kg. The TAT-NR2B9c peptide reduced infarct volume at doses of 300 and 1000 nmol/kg, but not to a statistically significant extent, while the 100 nmol/kg dose was ineffective. The reduction in infarct volume with R18 and TAT-NR2B9c peptide treatments was mirrored by improvements in one or more functional outcomes (namely, neurological score, adhesive tape removal, and rota-rod), but not to a statistically significant extent. These findings further confirm the neuroprotective properties of polyarginine peptides and for R18 extend its therapeutic time window and dose range, as well as demonstrating its greater efficacy compared to TAT-NR2B9c in a severe stroke model. The superior neuroprotective efficacy of R18 over TAT-NR2B9c highlights the potential of this polyarginine peptide as a lead candidate for studies in human stroke.",
      "# Title: Assessment of the Neuroprotective Effects of Arginine-Rich Protamine Peptides, Poly-Arginine Peptides (R12-Cyclic, R22) and Arginine-Tryptophan-Containing Peptides Following In Vitro Excitotoxicity and/or Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in Rats.\n# Abstract: We have demonstrated that arginine-rich and poly-arginine peptides possess potent neuroprotective properties with arginine content and peptide positive charge being particularly critical for neuroprotective efficacy. In addition, the presence of other amino acids within arginine-rich peptides, as well as chemical modifications, peptide length and cell-penetrating properties also influence the level of neuroprotection. Against this background, we have examined the neuroprotective efficacy of arginine-rich protamine peptides, a cyclic (R12-c) poly-arginine peptide and a R22 poly-arginine peptide, as well as arginine peptides containing tryptophan or other amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, glycine or leucine) in in vitro glutamic acid excitotoxicity and in vivo rat permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion models of stroke. In vitro studies demonstrated that protamine and poly-arginine peptides (R12-c, R22) were neuroprotective. Arginine-tryptophan-containing peptides were highly neuroprotective, with R12W8a being the most potent arginine-rich peptide identified in our laboratory. Peptides containing phenylalanine or tyrosine substituted in place of tryptophan in R12W8a were also highly neuroprotective, whereas leucine, and in particular glycine substitutions, decreased peptide efficacy. In vivo studies with protamine administered intravenously at 1000 nmol/kg 30 min after MCAO significantly reduced infarct volume and cerebral oedema by 22.5 and 38.6%, respectively. The R12W8a peptide was highly toxic when administered intravenously at 300 or 100 nmol/kg and ineffective at reducing infarct volume when administered at 30 nmol/kg 30 min after MCAO, unlike R18 (30 nmol/kg), which significantly reduced infarct volume by 20.4%. However, both R12W8a and R18 significantly reduced cerebral oedema by 19.8 and 42.2%, respectively. Protamine, R12W8a and R18 also reduced neuronal glutamic acid-induced calcium influx. These findings further highlight the neuroprotective properties of arginine-rich peptides and support the view that they represent a new class of neuroprotective agent.",
      "# Title: Delayed 2-h post-stroke administration of R18 and NA-1 (TAT-NR2B9c) peptides after permanent and/or transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat.\n# Abstract: Following positive results with the poly-arginine peptide R18 when administered intravenously 30 or 60min after permanent and/or transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO; 90min) in the rat, we examined the effectiveness of the peptide when administered 2h after MCAO. R18 was administered intravenously (1000nmol/kg via jugular vein) after permanent MCAO or a transient 3-h MCAO or when administered intra-arterially (100nmol/kg via internal carotid artery) immediately after reperfusion following a transient 2-h MCAO. In the transient MCAO studies, the neuroprotective NA-1 peptide was used as a positive control. Infarct volume, cerebral edema and functional outcomes were measured 24h after MCAO. Following permanent or transient MCAO, neither R18 nor NA-1 significantly reduced infarct volume. However, following permanent MCAO, R18 appeared to reduce cerebral edema (p=0.006), whereas following a transient 3-h MCAO, R18 improved the time to remove adhesive tape (p=0.04) without significantly affecting cerebral edema. There was also a trend (p=0.07) towards improved rota-rod performance with R18 in both permanent and transient 3-h MCAO. Following a transient 2-h MCAO, R18 had no significant effects on cerebral edema or neurological score but did lessen the extent of weight loss. Overall, while R18 had no effect on infarct volume, the peptide reduced cerebral edema after permanent MCAO, and improved some functional outcomes after transient MCAO.",
      "# Title: Warburg effect hypothesis in autism Spectrum disorders.\n# Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disease which is characterized by a deficit in social interactions and communication with repetitive and restrictive behavior. In altered cells, metabolic enzymes are modified by the dysregulation of the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway. In ASD, the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway is upregulated. We focus this review on the hypothesis of Warburg effect stimulated by the overexpression of the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway in ASD. Upregulation of WNT/β-catenin pathway induces aerobic glycolysis, named Warburg effect, through activation of glucose transporter (Glut), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1(PDK1), monocarboxylate lactate transporter 1 (MCT-1), lactate dehydrogenase kinase-A (LDH-A) and inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH). The aerobic glycolysis consists to a supply of a large part of glucose into lactate regardless of oxygen. Aerobic glycolysis is less efficient in terms of ATP production than oxidative phosphorylation because of the shunt of the TCA cycle. Dysregulation of energetic metabolism might promote cell deregulation and progression of ASD. Warburg effect regulation could be an attractive target for developing therapeutic interventions in ASD.",
      "# Title: Comparison of neuroprotective efficacy of poly-arginine R18 and R18D (D-enantiomer) peptides following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in the Wistar rat and in vitro toxicity studies.\n# Abstract: We have previously demonstrated that arginine-rich and poly-arginine peptides possess potent neuroprotective properties, with poly-arginine peptide R18 identified as being highly effective at reducing infarct volume following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the Sprague Dawley rat. Since peptides synthesised using D-isoform amino acids have greater stability than L-isoform peptides due to increased resistance to proteolytic degradation, they represent potentially more effective peptide therapeutics. Therefore we compared the neuroprotective efficacy of R18 and its D-enantiomer R18D following permanent MCAO in the Wistar rat. Furthermore, as increased peptide stability may also increase peptide toxicity, we examined the effects of R18 and R18D on cultured cortical neurons, astrocytes, brain endothelial cells (bEND.3), and embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) following a 10-minute or 24-hour peptide exposure duration. The in vivo studies demonstrated that R18D resulted in a greater reduction in mean infarct volume compared to R18 (33%, p = 0.004 vs 12%, p = 0.27) after intravenous administration at 300 nmol/kg 30 minutes after MCAO. Both R18D and R18 reduced cerebral hemisphere swelling to a comparable degree (27%, p = 0.03 and 30%, p = 0.02), and improved neurological assessment scores (1.5, p = 0.02 and 2, p = 0.058 vs 3 for vehicle). No abnormal histological findings specific to peptide treatments were observed in hematoxylin and eosin stained sections of kidney, liver, spleen, lung and heart. In vitro studies demonstrated that R18 and R18D were most toxic to neurons, followed by astrocytes, HEK293 and bEND.3 cells, but only at high concentrations and/or following 24-hour exposure. These findings further highlight the neuroprotective properties of poly-arginine peptides, and indicate that R18D at the dose examined is more potent than R18 in Wistar rats, and justify continued investigation of the R18 peptide as a novel neuroprotective agent for stroke.",
      "# Title: Assessment of therapeutic window for poly-arginine-18D (R18D) in a P7 rat model of perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy.\n# Abstract: Hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) remains the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in neonates, with no available neuroprotective therapeutic agent. In the development of a therapeutic for HIE, we examined the neuroprotective efficacy of the poly-arginine peptide R18D (arginine 18 mer synthesised with D-arginine) in a perinatal model of hypoxia-ischaemia (HI; common carotid and external carotid occlusion + 8%O2 /92%N2 for 2.5 hr) in the P7 Sprague-Dawley rat. R18D was administered intraperitoneally 30 min (doses 10, 30, 100, 300 and 1,000 nmol/kg), 60 min (doses 30 and 300 nmol/kg) or 120 min (doses 30 and 300 nmol/kg) after HI. Infarct volumes and behavioural outcomes were measured 48 hr after HI. When administered 30 min after HI, R18D at varying doses reduced infarct volume by 23.7% to 35.6% (p = 0.009 to < 0.0001) and resulted in improvements in the negative geotactic response and wire-hang times, at a dose of 30 nmol/kg. When administered 60 min after HI, R18D at the 30 nmol/kg dose reduced total infarct volume by 34.2% (p = 0.002), whilst the 300 nmol/kg dose improved wire-hang time. When administered 120 min after HI, R18D at the 30 and 300 nmol/kg doses had no significant impact on infarct volume, but the 300 nmol/kg dose improved the negative geotactic response. This study further confirms the neuroprotective properties of poly-arginine peptides, demonstrating that R18D can reduce infarct volume and improve behavioural outcomes after HI if administered up to 60 min after HI and improve behavioural outcomes up to 2 hr after HI.",
      "# Title: Poly-Arginine Peptides R18 and R18D Improve Functional Outcomes After Endothelin-1-Induced Stroke in the Sprague Dawley Rat.\n# Abstract: We have previously demonstrated that R18 and its d-enantiomer, R18D, are neuroprotective at 24 hours following intraluminal filament occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) in the rat. This study examined R18 and R18D effectiveness in improving functional outcomes at up to 56 days poststroke following endothelin-1-induced MCAO. Peptides were administered intravenously at doses of 100, 300, or 1000 nmol/kg, 60 minutes after MCAO. Functional recovery poststroke was assessed using multiple forelimb placing tests and horizontal ladder test, and NA-1 (TAT-NR2B9c), a neuroprotective currently in phase 3 clinical stroke trials, was used as a benchmark. The study demonstrated that R18 (300 and 1000 nmol/kg) was the most effective peptide in improving functional outcomes, followed by R18D (300 and 1000 nmol/kg), and NA-1 (300 and 100 nmol/kg). Furthermore, R18 at doses of 300 and 1000 nmol/kg was the most effective agent in restoring pre-stroke body weight, while R18 and R18D at doses of 300 and 1000 nmol/kg, but not NA-1 also significantly reduced the number of animals requiring hand feeding 48 hours after stroke. This study confirms that R18 and R18D are effective in improving long-term functional outcomes after stroke, and suggests that R18 may be more effective than NA-1.",
      "# Title: Comparative Assessment of the Proteolytic Stability and Impact of Poly-Arginine Peptides R18 and R18D on Infarct Growth and Penumbral Tissue Preservation Following Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in the Sprague Dawley Rat.\n# Abstract: Poly-arginine peptides R18 and R18D have previously been demonstrated to be neuroprotective in ischaemic stroke models. Here we examined the proteolytic stability and efficacy of R18 and R18D in reducing infarct core growth and preserving the ischaemic penumbra following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the Sprague Dawley rat. R18 (300 or 1000 nmol/kg), R18D (300 nmol/kg) or saline were administered intravenously 10 min after MCAO induced using a filament. Serial perfusion and diffusion-weighted MRI imaging was performed to measure changes in the infarct core and penumbra from time points between 45- and 225-min post-occlusion. Repeated measures analyses of infarct growth and penumbral tissue size were evaluated using generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs). R18D (300 nmol/kg) was most effective in slowing infarct core growth (46.8 mm3 reduction; p < 0.001) and preserving penumbral tissue (21.6% increase; p < 0.001), followed by R18 at the 300 nmol/kg dose (core: 29.5 mm3 reduction; p < 0.001, penumbra: 12.5% increase; p < 0.001). R18 at the 1000 nmol/kg dose had a significant impact in slowing core growth (19.5 mm3 reduction; p = 0.026), but only a modest impact on penumbral preservation (6.9% increase; p = 0.062). The in vitro anti-excitotoxic neuroprotective efficacy of R18D was also demonstrated to be unaffected when preincubated for 1-3 h or overnight, in a cell lysate prepared from dying neurons or with the proteolytic enzyme, plasmin, whereas the neuroprotective efficacy of R18 was significantly reduced after a 2-h incubation. These findings highlight the capacity of poly-arginine peptides to reduce infarct growth and preserve the ischaemic penumbra, and confirm the superior efficacy and proteolytic stability of R18D, which indicates that this peptide is likely to retain its neuroprotective properties when co-administered with alteplase during thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke."

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 49 patients with type 2 diabetes who underwent radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer in the Department of gastroenterology of the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University from Jan to Dec 2020. They were randomly divided into experimental group and control group according to different perioperative management measures. The perioperative C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell (WBC), interleukin-6(IL-6), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), blood glucose fluctuation and postoperative recovery were compared between the two groups. Results: A total of 49 patients were enrolled in the study (23 in the experimental group and 26 in the control group). The degree of stress reaction of the experimental group was lighter than that of the control group. The levels of CRP were significantly different on the 5th and 7th day after operation, IL-6 was significantly different on the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th day after operation, WBC and HOMA-IR were significantly different on the 1st day postoperatively. And the changes of HOMA-IR and blood glucose in experimental group were more gentle than those in control group. All the differences were statistically significant(P<0.05). In the experimental group, the time of first anal exhaust, indwelling time of drainage tube or nasointestinal tube and the total hospitalization time were significantly shorter than those of the control group(P<0.05).

The current study analyzed the clinical significance of this new stage in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Subjects and Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 4045 eligible PTC patients. The patients were divided into four groups according to the extent of ETE: no ETE, ETE into perithyroidal tissue, T3b (ETE into the strap muscles), and ETE beyond the strap muscles. Differences in the clinical characteristics and prognosis of the four groups were assessed. Results: Of these 4045 patients, 2300 (56.9%) had no ETE, 1004 (24.8%) had ETE into perithyroidal tissue, 371 (9.2%) had ETE into the strap muscles, and 370 (9.1%) had ETE beyond the strap muscles. Tumor size, multifocality, lymph node metastasis (LNM), distant metastasis (DM), recurrence, and recurrence-free survival (RFS) between patients with ETE into perithyroidal tissue and patients without ETE did not show differences, but significant differences were observed between patients with T3b and patients without ETE, and only patients with ETE beyond the strap muscles had significantly worse overall survival (OS) than the other three groups. However, T3b did not independently predict worse RFS in univariable and multivariable analyses. Conclusions: T3b, distinguished from minimal ETE, may be related to larger tumor size, higher prevalence of multifocality, LNM, DM, recurrence, and worse RFS than no ETE, but it may not affect OS and may not independently predict recurrence in PTC patients.",
      "# Title: Is There a Difference Between Minimal and Gross Extension into the Strap Muscles for the Risk of Recurrence in Papillary Thyroid Carcinomas?\n# Abstract: Background: The morbidity of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is primarily related to locoregional recurrences and distant metastases. The definition of minimal extrathyroidal extension (mETE) has been recently revised. The presence of mETE does not impact mortality and is generally not considered to be a predictor for the risk of recurrence. This study aimed at comparing the risk of recurrence and the response to therapy of PTC with mETE and gross extrathyroidal extension (ETE) into the strap muscles (gETE) with low- and intermediate-risk PTC without ETE (low risk w/o ETE and intermediate risk w/o ETE, respectively) to further characterize the impact of ETE on outcomes. Methods: A total of 596 PTCs were analyzed according to the degree of ETE as well as other predictors of recurrence. Four groups of patients were compared, low risk w/o ETE (n = 251), intermediate risk w/o ETE (n = 89), mETE (n = 191), and gETE (n = 65), to determine the risk of recurrence and the response to treatment. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate associations between groups and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: The risk of recurrence was 3% in low risk w/o ETE PTC, 14% in intermediate risk w/o ETE, 14% in mETE, and 25% in gETE. The recurrence risk was increased by the presence of ETE (odds ratio [OR] = 2.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-5.85, p = 0.005) and lymph node metastases (OR = 2.44 [95% CI 1.25-4.76], p = 0.009). Patients with low-risk carcinomas w/o ETE experienced longer DFS than those with mETE (hazard ratio = 0.08 [95% CI 0.02-0.28], p < 0.001), but no significant difference was observed between intermediate risk w/o ETE, mETE, and gETE. In terms of the response to therapy, patients with gETE had higher rates of biochemical and/or structural incomplete responses within the first year of treatment (OR = 2.68 [95% CI 1.31-5.45], p = 0.007) and at the final follow-up evaluation (OR = 4.35 [95% CI 1.99-9.51], p < 0.001) compared with those with mETE. An analysis of the subgroups of microcarcinomas without lymph node metastases revealed no significant difference in DFS or the response to therapy between the low risk w/o ETE and mETE PTC groups. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that both mETE and gETE are independent risk factors for the risk of recurrence in PTC. Although gETE has a more pronounced impact on the recurrence risk and is associated with a worse response to therapy, mETE may not be associated with a low risk of recurrence. This observation suggests that patients with PTC and mETE may, in part, have an intermediate risk of recurrence and need to be followed accordingly."

After an adjusted regression analysis, the between-group difference in FIV (19.1 ml; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.2 to 25.2; P = 0.038) significantly favored the IA-SCI group. At 90 days, no differences were found in the proportion of patients who achieved functional independence (mRS 0-2) (51.1% versus. 41.2%, adjusted odd ratio (aOR) 1.9, 95% CI 0.8-2.6, P = 0.192). Combining short-duration IA-SCI with MT was safe. There was a smaller FIV and trend towards clinical benefit that will need to be further evaluated in randomized control trials.",

      "# Title: Effect of intravenous thrombolysis combined with mild hypothermia on the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in patients with acute cerebral infarction and clinical significance.\n# Abstract: The present study aimed to explore the effects and clinical importance of serum interleukin (IL) IL-1β, IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 in patients with acute cerebral infarction undergoing intravenous thrombolysis during simultaneous hypothermia therapy. A total of 80 patients with acute cerebral infarction who were treated at our hospital were randomly selected. They were divided into groups A and B. The two groups were treated with intravenous thrombolysis, while group B received sub-hypothermia treatment. Prior to treatment and at 7 days after treatment, 5 ml of venous blood was collected and stored in a freezer at -80˚C. IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 levels were detected by ELISA and compared between the groups and time-points. The results were as follows: i) At 7 days after treatment, the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in group B were significantly decreased compared with those in group A (P<0.05), while there was no significant difference of these levels between group A and B before treatment (P>0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions in group A and group B was 35 and 20% respectively, and the mortality rate was 10 and 5%, respectively. There were no significant differences in adverse events and mortality between the two groups (P>0.05). In addition, a positive correlation of the level of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was determined in the patients prior to treatment. In conclusion, mild hypothermia treatment in addition to intravenous thrombolysis significantly reduced the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in patients with acute cerebral infarction and reduced inflammation, and should therefore be incorporated in clinical practice.",

      "conclusionB": "**Primary Concluding Statement:**\n\nBased on current evidence from large randomized controlled trials, the addition of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) to mechanical thrombectomy (MT) **significantly improves functional outcomes at 90 days compared to MT alone** for patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion, particularly within 6 hours of symptom onset, without a significant increase in early mortality. This benefit generally outweighs the increased risk of hemorrhagic transformation associated with combined therapy in appropriately selected patients."

    "referenceConclusion": "Pre-conditioning significantly reduced the severity of creatine kinase release, delayed-onset muscle soreness, loss of maximal voluntary contraction force and the range of motion decrease. Pre-conditioning may prevent severe EIMD and accelerate recovery of muscle force generation capacity. The current systematic review identified that pre-conditioning activities are effective in attenuating EIMD measures, CK, muscle soreness, ROM and maximal voluntary force production. These findings suggest the use of pre-conditioning activities prior to a strenuous bout of exercise does provide a significant protective effect when performed a minimum of 24 h prior to the damaging stimulus. Furthermore, the greater improvement in MVC suggests that the pre-conditioning activities may accelerate the recovery of muscle contractile properties following strenuous exercises. However, it is unclear if pre-conditioning would prevent EIMD from more complex exercises or to what extent EIMD prevention carries over into other modes of exercise.",

      "# Title: Muscle tenderness and peak torque changes after downhill running following a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: Unaccustomed exercise (usually of an eccentric nature) is often followed by delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Previous studies have found that prior eccentric activity produces a training effect which reduces DOMS and morphological changes. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a prior bout of maximal isokinetic eccentric exercise on DOMS, strength loss and plasma creatine kinase (CK) changes following a downhill run. Ten male subjects with a mean (+/- S.D.) age of 22.5 +/- 2.8 years, body mass of 62.67 +/- 0.05 kg and height of 176 +/- 3 cm were allocated to either a treatment group or a control group. The treatment group performed 100 maximal eccentric activations of the knee extensors in the dominant leg at 0.52 rad s-1. Two weeks later, the downhill run was performed on a motor-driven treadmill. This consisted of five bouts of 8 min at a gradient of -10% at a speed corresponding to 80% of the predicted maximal heart rate. The untrained group performed the downhill run as above but without the prior isokinetic session. Tenderness measurements, plasma CK activity and concentric and eccentric isokinetic peak torque measurements of the knee extensors at 0.52 and 2.83 rad s-1 were recorded prior to, immediately following and 2, 4 and 7 days after each protocol. The isokinetic protocol caused an increase (P < 0.01) in CK and tenderness and a decrease (P < 0.05) in concentric and eccentric torque at both speeds in the treatment group. Following the downhill run, a reduction in peak torque (P < 0.01) was observed in the eccentric and concentric modes at both isokinetic speeds in the control group. For the treatment group, the decrease in peak torque occurred only at the faster eccentric speed. With the exception of the faster eccentric speed, the decrement in peak torque was greater in the control group in all post-exercise isokinetic strength tests. There was less tenderness (P < 0.01) in the trained knee extensor muscle group. Peak torque also returned to pre-downhill values earlier for the trained group. Although plasma CK activity increased in both groups after downhill running, it was much lower (P < 0.01) in the trained group. The results suggest that a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric training reduces muscle damage, reduces the amount of strength loss and decreases the sensation of DOMS after downhill running.",
      "# Title: Exercise-induced skeletal muscle damage and adaptation following repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions.\n# Abstract: Repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions were used to examine indirect indices of exercise-induced muscle damage and adaptation in human skeletal muscle. Twenty-four subjects (18 females, 6 males) aged 20.0 +/- 1.4 years (mean +/- S.D.) performed an initial bout of either 10 (n = 7), 30 (n = 9) or 50 (n = 8) maximum voluntary eccentric contractions of the knee extensors, followed by a second bout of 50 contractions 3 weeks later using the same leg. Muscle soreness was elevated after all bouts (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon test), although the initial bout reduced the soreness associated with the second bout. Force loss and a decline in the 20:100 Hz percutaneous electrical myostimulation force ratio were observed after all exercise bouts (P < 0.01). Serum creatine kinase activity was elevated following the initial bouts of 30 and 50 repetitions (P < 0.01), but there was no increase following 10 repetitions. No increase in serum creatine kinase activity was observed in any group following the second bout of contractions (P > 0.05). We conclude that skeletal muscle adaptation can be brought about by a single bout of relatively few eccentric muscle contractions. Increasing the number of eccentric muscle repetitions did not result in an increased prophylactic effect on skeletal muscle.",
      "# Title: Influence of previous concentric exercise on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether a fatiguing concentric exercise performed immediately before eccentric exercise would exacerbate eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. One arm of nine female subjects (mean +/- s: 23.3 +/- 6.7 years) performed 12 maximal eccentric actions of the elbow flexors (ECC), and the other arm performed 100 repetitions of isokinetic concentric actions of the elbow flexors followed by the same eccentric exercise (CON-ECC). The two exercise regimens (ECC and CON-ECC) were separated by 2 weeks and presented in a counterbalanced order. Changes in muscle soreness level, maximal isometric force generation, relaxed and flexed elbow joint angle, upper arm circumference and plasma creatine kinase activity were compared between the ECC and CON-ECC conditions. All measures changed significantly after both ECC and CON-ECC; however, there were significant differences in the changes between the conditions. A lower level of soreness, a faster recovery of maximal isometric force generation, a smaller decrease in relaxed elbow joint angle and a smaller increase in upper arm circumference and creatine kinase activity were evident after the CON-ECC condition compared to the ECC condition. Thus, it would seem that muscle damage was attenuated by performance of previous concentric exercise. An additional experiment using a different group of subjects (n = 5) showed that warm-up exercise before the eccentric exercise also attenuated eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Acute adaptation to low volume eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: Many symptoms of eccentric muscle damage can be substantially reduced if a similar eccentric bout is repeated within several weeks of the initial bout.

      "# Title: The repeated bout effect of reduced-load eccentric exercise on elbow flexor muscle damage.\n# Abstract: In this study we investigated the extent to which an initial eccentric exercise consisting of two (2ECC) or six maximal eccentric actions (6ECC) of the elbow flexors would produce a similar effect to 24 maximal eccentric actions (24ECC), on a second bout of 24ECC performed 2 weeks later. Male students (n = 34) were assigned to one of three groups, and with their non-dominant arm performed either 2ECC (n = 12), 6ECC (n = 10), or 24ECC (n = 12) as a first bout of exercise. Two weeks later all groups performed 24ECC. Maximal isometric strength, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration were assessed before, immediately after, and for 4 days after exercise. Changes in all variables were compared between the bouts and groups by a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance. All variables changed significantly (P< 0.05) after 2ECC, 6ECC, and 24ECC, but the amount of change after 2ECC and 6ECC was significantly smaller (P<0.05) than both 6ECC and 24ECC, and 24ECC, respectively. After the second bout, the 6ECC and 24ECC groups showed a profound repeated bout effect, and no significant differences were found between the groups. All variables except muscle soreness were significantly (P< 0.05) larger after the second bout for the 2ECC group, however the changes observed after 24ECC were significantly smaller (P < 0.01) than those observed after the first 24ECC of the 24ECC group. These results suggest that it is not necessary to conduct a high number of eccentric actions in the first bout to elicit a repeated bout effect in a subsequent bout performed some time later.",

      "# Title: Intensity of eccentric exercise, shift of optimum angle, and the magnitude of repeated-bout effect.\n# Abstract: This study compared the effect of four different intensities of initial eccentric exercise (ECC1) on optimum angle shift and extent of muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise. Fifty-two male students were placed into 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% groups (n = 13 per group), performing 30 eccentric actions of the elbow flexors of 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% of maximal isometric strength [maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)] for ECC1, followed 2-3 wk later by a similar exercise (ECC2) that used 100% MVC load. MVC at six elbow joint angles, range of motion, upper arm circumference, serum creatine kinase activity, myoglobin concentration, and muscle soreness were measured before and for 5 days following ECC1 and ECC2. A rightward shift of optimum angle following ECC1 was significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 100% and 80% than for the 60% and 40% groups, and it decreased significantly (P < 0.05) from immediately to 5 days postexercise. By the time ECC2 was performed, only the 100% group kept a significant shift (4 degrees). Changes in most of the criterion measures following ECC1 were significantly greater for the 100% and 80% groups compared with the 60% and 40% groups. Changes in the criterion measures following ECC2 were significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 40% group compared with other groups. Although the magnitude of repeated bout effect following ECC2 was significantly (P < 0.05) smaller for the 40% and 60% groups, all groups showed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced changes in criterion measures following ECC2 compared with the ECC1 100% bout. We conclude that the repeated-bout effect was not dependent on the shift of optimum angle.",
      "# Title: Repeated bout effect after maximal eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: We hypothesized that a bout of high or low volume eccentric exercise would protect against muscle damage following a subsequent high volume bout and that adaptation would be attributable to neural changes, independent of the initial exercise volume. Sixteen males performed either 45 (ECC45) or 10 (ECC10) maximal eccentric contractions using the elbow flexors, followed by an ECC45 bout 2 weeks later. Damage markers were measured for the following 96 h; EMG and work done during the first 10 eccentric contractions were also recorded. CK, soreness, and decrements in MVC and range of motion (ROM) were greater in bout 1 than bout 2 (p < 0.01). Soreness, MVC and ROM were greater after the initial ECC45 bout compared to the initial ECC10 bout and the repeated bouts of ECC45 exercise in both groups (p < 0.01). Median frequency decreased from bout 1 to bout 2 (p < 0.001), no differences between groups were observed. An ECC45 bout of maximal eccentric exercise causes more initial damage than an ECC10 bout of maximal eccentric exercise, although both confer protection from subsequent ECC45 bouts of maximal eccentric contractions, which are attributable, at least in part, to a shift in the frequency content of EMG.",
      "# Title: A light load eccentric exercise confers protection against a subsequent bout of more demanding eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that a light eccentric exercise (ECC) that does not induce a loss of muscle function and delayed onset muscle soreness would confer a protective effect against a more strenuous ECC. Eighteen young men were randomly placed into two groups: 10-40% (n=9) and 40% (n=9). Subjects in the 10-40% group performed ECC of the elbow flexors (six sets of five reps) using a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (MVC) at an elbow joint angle of 90 degrees , followed 2 days later by ECC using a dumbbell weight of 40% MVC. Subjects in the 40% group performed the 40% ECC only. Changes in MVC, range of motion (ROM), upper arm circumference (CIR), plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and muscle soreness before, immediately after, 1-5 and 7 days following the 40% ECC were compared between groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any of the criterion measures were found immediately and 1-2 days after the 10% ECC. Following the 40% ECC, the 10-40% group showed significantly (P<0.05) smaller decreases in MVC and ROM, and smaller increases in muscle soreness compared with the 40% group, but no significant differences between groups were evident for CIR and plasma CK activity. These results suggest that the 10% ECC induced some protection against a subsequent bout of 40% ECC performed 2 days later. It appears that the light eccentric exercise preconditioned the muscles for exposure to the subsequent damaging eccentric exercise bout.",
      "# Title: Protection against muscle damage following fifty drop jumps conferred by ten drop jumps.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether 10 drop jumps (DJs) would confer protective effect against muscle damage and soreness in a subsequent bout of 50 DJs. Sixteen men were randomly placed into either a group performing 1 set of 10 DJs followed by 5 sets of 10 DJs (10-50, n = 8) or another group performing 2 bouts of 5 sets of 10 DJs (50-50, n = 8) separated by 2 weeks. The DJs were performed from a box height of 0.6 m, with a 10-second interval between jumps and a 1-minute rest between sets. Jump height, peak vertical ground reaction force, ground contact time, and heart rate during DJs were measured, and blood lactate concentration was assessed before and immediately after DJs. Changes in maximal isometric (ISO) and isokinetic concentric torque (CON), vertical jump, muscle soreness, and plasma creatine kinase activity before, immediately after, and at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours following exercise were compared between groups for the first and second bouts and between the bouts by a 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance. Changes in ISO, CON, vertical jump, and muscle soreness were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller for 10 DJs compared with 50 DJs; however, no significant differences in the measures between groups were evident following the second bout. The changes in the measures following 50 DJs in the 10-50 group were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller than those following the first bout of the 50-50 group. These results suggest that 10 DJs and 50 DJs conferred the same magnitude of protective effect against muscle damage by 50 DJs.",
      "# Title: Muscle damage protection by low-intensity eccentric contractions remains for 2 weeks but not 3 weeks.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that the protective effect conferred by a low-intensity eccentric exercise against maximal eccentric exercise would not last more than a week. Untrained men (21.3 ± 1.6 years) were allocated into either a control or one of four repeated bout groups (n = 13 per group). The repeated bout groups performed 30 low-intensity eccentric contractions (ECC) of the elbow flexors with a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (10%-ECC) either 2 days, 7 days (1 week), 14 days (2 weeks) or 21 days (3 weeks) before 30 maximal eccentric contractions (Max-ECC). The control group performed Max-ECC only. Changes in maximal voluntary contraction strength, optimum angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following 10%-ECC were analysed by a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Changes in the variables following Max-ECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. The 10%-ECC did not change any variables, showing no indication of muscle damage. The changes in all variables following Max-ECC were smaller (P < 0.05) for 2-day, 1- and 2-week groups than control group, without significant differences between 2-day and 1-week groups. The 2-week group showed greater (P < 0.05) changes in all variables compared with 2-day and 1-week groups. Changes in the variables were similar between 3-week and control groups, except for muscle soreness showing smaller (P < 0.05) changes for 3-week group. These results suggest that non-damaging eccentric exercise confers a protective effect against Max-Ecc, but the effect is attenuated between 1 and 2 weeks.",
      "# Title: Two maximal isometric contractions attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVC-ISO) would attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. Young untrained men were placed into one of the two experimental groups or one control group (n = 13 per group). Subjects in the experimental groups performed either two or 10 MVC-ISO of the elbow flexors at a long muscle length (20° flexion) 2 days prior to 30 maximal isokinetic eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors. Subjects in the control group performed the eccentric contractions without MVC-ISO. No significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction peak torque, peak torque angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and myoglobin concentration, muscle soreness, and ultrasound echo intensity were evident after MVC-ISO. Changes in the variables following eccentric contractions were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2 MVC-ISO group (e.g., peak torque loss at 5 days after exercise, 23% ± 3%; peak CK activity, 1964 ± 452 IU·L(-1); peak muscle soreness, 46 ± 4 mm) or the 10 MVC-ISO group (13% ± 3%, 877 ± 198 IU·L(-1), 30 ± 4 mm) compared with the control (34% ± 4%, 6192 ± 1747 IU·L(-1), 66 ± 5 mm). The 10 MVC-ISO group showed smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following eccentric contractions compared with the 2 MVC-ISO group. Therefore, two MVC-ISO conferred potent protective effects against muscle damage, whereas greater protective effect was induced by 10 MVC-ISO, which can be used as a strategy to minimize muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Attenuation of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage by preconditioning exercises.\n# Abstract: This study compared the effect of an initial exercise consisting of either low-intensity eccentric or maximal isometric contractions (ISOs) on protective effect against maximal eccentric contraction (MaxECC)-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions attenuate muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise of the knee extensors in the elderly.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors would attenuate the magnitude of muscle damage induced by maximal eccentric exercise of the same muscle performed 7 days later using elderly individuals. Healthy older men (66.4 ± 4.6 years) were assigned to control or experimental (Exp) group (n = 13 per group). The control group performed six sets of ten maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC) of the knee extensors of non-dominant leg. The Exp group performed six sets of ten low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors on a leg extension machine by lowering a weight of 10 % maximal voluntary isometric knee extension strength (10 %ECC) 7 days prior to MaxECC. Changes in maximal voluntary isokinetic concentric torque (MVC-CON), angle at peak torque, range of motion (ROM), upper thigh circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin (Mb) concentration and B-mode ultrasound echo-intensity before and for 5 days after MaxECC were compared between groups by a mixed factor ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were observed following 10 %ECC. Following MaxECC, all variables changed significantly, and changes in all variables except for angle at peak torque were significantly different between groups. MVC-CON and ROM decreased smaller and recovered faster (P < 0.05) for Exp than control group, and changes in other variables were smaller (P < 0.05) for Exp group compared with control group. These results suggest that preconditioning knee extensor muscles with low-intensity eccentric contractions was effective for attenuating muscle damage induced by subsequent MaxECC of the knee extensors for elderly individuals.",
      "# Title: Effect of two maximal isometric contractions on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the elbow flexors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the time wise protective effect conferred by two maximal voluntary isometric contractions (2MVCs) at 20° elbow flexion on muscle damage induced by 30 maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors (MaxECC). Sixty-five young untrained men were randomly assigned to a control group that did not perform 2MVCs, or one of four experimental groups (n = 13 per group) who performed 2MVCs either immediately (0d), 2 (2d), 4 (4d) or 7 days (7d) before MaxECC. Changes in maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) concentric torque (MVC-CON), optimum angle (OA), range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following MaxECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were evident following 2MVCs. The 2d and 4d groups showed 16-62 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following MaxECC than the control, 0d and 7d groups. The 2d group showed 14-34 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables except for OA compared with the 4d group. The changes in the variables were similar among the control, 0d and 7d groups. These results show that 2MVCs that were performed between 2 and 4 days before MaxECC attenuated the magnitude of muscle damage, but no such effect was evident if the 2MVCs were performed immediately or 7 days before MaxECC. It is concluded that the protective effect conferred by 2MVCs is relatively short-lived, and there is a window for the effect to be conferred.",
      "# Title: Effect of a prior bout of preconditioning exercise on muscle damage from downhill walking.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether reduced-duration downhill walking (DW) would confer a protective effect against muscle damage induced by a subsequent bout of longer duration DW performed 1 week or 4 weeks later. Healthy young adults were allocated to a control or one of the preconditioning exercise (PRE-1wk or PRE-4wk) groups (10 men and 4 women per group). PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups performed 20-min DW (-28% slope, 5 km/h, 10% body mass added to a backpack) 1 week and 4 weeks before 40-min DW, respectively, and the control group performed 40-min DW only. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) knee extension torque, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity, and muscle soreness (100-mm visual analog scale) were measured before, immediately after, and 24, 48, and 72 h after DW, and the changes in these variables were compared among groups. The control group showed symptoms of muscle damage (e.g., prolonged decrease in MVC: -14% ± 10% at 48 h post-DW) after 40-min DW. Changes in all variables after 40-min DW of PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups were 54%-61% smaller (P < 0.05) than the control group, without significant differences between PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups for MVC and plasma CK activity. Importantly, changes after the preconditioning exercise (20-min DW) were 67%-69% smaller (P < 0.05) than those after the 40-min DW of the control group. These findings suggest that 20-min DW resulting in minor muscle damage conferred a protective effect against subsequent 40-min DW, and its effect could last for more than 4 weeks.",

      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors and flexors protect against muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the magnitude and duration of the protective effect of low-intensity eccentric contractions (LowEC) against damage induced by maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) of the knee flexors (KF) and extensors (KE). Young men were assigned to 8 experimental groups and 2 control groups (n = 13/group); the experimental groups performed LowEC of KF or KE 2 days (2d), 1 week (1wk), 2 weeks (2wk), or 3 weeks (3wk) before MaxEC, while the control groups performed MaxEC of KF or KE without LowEC. The 2d, 1wk, 2wk, and 3wk groups performed 30 LowEC of KF or 60 LowEC of KE with a load of 10% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction strength on a resistance-training machine, and all groups performed 30 MaxEC of KF or 60 MaxEC of KE on an isokinetic dynamometer. Several muscle damage markers were measured from before to 2 days after exercise (LowEC) or from before to 5 days after exercise (MaxEC). No significant changes in any variables were evident after LowEC. The changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2d and 1wk groups (e.g., peak creatine kinase activity: 1002 ± 501 IU/L; peak muscle soreness: 13 ± 5 mm) than for the control group (peak creatine kinase activity: 3005 ± 983 IU/L; peak muscle soreness 28 ± 6 mm) for both KE and KF. There were no significant differences between the 2d and 1wk groups or among the 2wk, 3wk, and control groups. These results show that LowEC provided 30%-66% protection against damage induced by MaxEC of KF and KE, and the protective effect lasted 1 week.",

Untrained men were placed to an experimental group that performed 6 sets of 10 MVIC at 90° knee flexion 2 weeks before 6 sets of 10 MaxEC or a control group that performed MaxEC only (n = 13/group). Changes in muscle damage markers were assessed before to 5 days after each exercise. Small but significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction torque, range of motion (ROM) and plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity were evident at immediately to 2 days post-MVIC (p < 0.05), but other variables (e.g. thigh girth, myoglobin concentration, B-mode echo intensity) did not change significantly. Changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (p < 0.05) by 45% (soreness)-67% (CK) for the experimental than the control group. These results suggest that MVIC conferred potent protective effect against MaxEC-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Prevention of downhill walking-induced muscle damage by non-damaging downhill walking.\n# Abstract: Mountain trekking involves level, uphill, and downhill walking (DW). Prolonged DW induces damage to leg muscles, reducing force generating ability and muscle coordination. These increase risks for more serious injuries and accidents in mountain trekking, thus a strategy to minimize muscle damage is warranted. It has been shown that low-intensity eccentric contractions confer protective effect on muscle damage induced by high-intensity eccentric contractions. This study tested the hypothesis that 5-min non-damaging DW would attenuate muscle damage induced by 40-min DW, but 5-min level walking (LW) would not.",
      "# Title: Isometric pre-conditioning blunts exercise-induced muscle damage but does not attenuate changes in running economy following downhill running.\n# Abstract: Running economy (RE) is impaired following unaccustomed eccentric-biased exercises that induce muscle damage. It is also known that muscle damage is reduced when maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) are performed at a long muscle length 2-4 days prior to maximal eccentric exercise with the same muscle, a phenomenon that can be described as isometric pre-conditioning (IPC). We tested the hypothesis that IPC could attenuate muscle damage and changes in RE following downhill running. Thirty untrained men were randomly assigned into experimental or control groups and ran downhill on a treadmill (-15%) for 30 min. Participants in the experimental group completed 10 MVIC in a leg press machine two days prior to downhill running, while participants in the control group did not perform IPC. The magnitude of changes in muscle soreness determined 48 h after downhill running was greater for the control group (122 ± 28 mm) than for the experimental group (92 ± 38 mm). Isometric peak torque recovered faster in the experimental group compared with the control group (3 days vs. no full recovery, respectively). No significant effect of IPC was found for countermovement jump height, serum creatine kinase activity or any parameters associated with RE. These results supported the hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in markers of muscle damage. The hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in RE was not supported by our data. It appears that the mechanisms involved in changes in markers of muscle damage and parameters associated with RE following downhill running are not completely shared.",
      "# Title: Damage protective effects conferred by low-intensity eccentric contractions on arm, leg and trunk muscles.\n# Abstract: Low-intensity eccentric contractions with a load corresponding to 10% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction strength (10% EC) attenuate muscle damage in a subsequent bout of higher-intensity eccentric contractions performed within 2 weeks for the elbow flexors, knee flexors and knee extensors. However, it is not known whether this strategy could be applied to other muscles. This study investigated whether 10% EC would confer damage protective effect on high-intensity eccentric contractions (80% EC) for nine different muscle groups.",
      "# Title: Protective Effect Conferred by Isometric Preconditioning Against Slow- and Fast-Velocity Eccentric Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage.\n# Abstract: We investigated if the same isometric preconditioning protocol (IPP) attenuates the magnitude of muscle damage induced by different maximal eccentric exercise protocols in the elbow flexors. Sixty-four untrained men were assigned to either two experimental or two control groups. Participants in the experimental groups performed an IPP prior to either slow (60°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-S) or fast (180°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-F) maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC). Subjects in the control groups performed slow (ECC-S) or fast (ECC-F) MaxECC without IPP. Maximal isokinetic concentric torque (MVC), muscle soreness (SOR), and muscle thickness (MT) were assessed before, immediately after, and 1-4 days following the MaxECC. Significant (p < 0.05) group vs. time interactions were found for MVC (F = 4,517), SOR (F = 6,318), and MT (F = 1,863). The ECC-S group presented faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and MT and less (p < 0.05) SOR at 96 h post-MaxECC compared with ECC-F group. No significant differences in MVC and MT were found between ECC-S and ECC-F groups following MaxECC. The ISO + ECC-S group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and SOR compared to the ECC-S group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ECC-S in any variable. The ISO + ECC-F group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of all assessed variables compared with the ECC-F group. MVC was greater (p < 0.05) at 48-72 h, and SOR was less (p < 0.05) at 48-96 h in the ISO + ECC-F compared to the ECC-F group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ISO + ECC-F for any variable. These results show that the IPP accelerated recovery of MVC and SOR for the slow-eccentric exercise condition and attenuated strength loss and SOR in addition to faster recovery of all assessed variables for the fast-eccentric exercise condition. Therefore, the IPP can be used as a strategy to attenuate and accelerate recovery of muscle damage induced by different-velocity eccentric exercises, resulting in greater protection against muscle damage induced by faster velocity."

      "conclusionA": "Performing a prior bout of low-to-moderate volume eccentric or isometric exercise—even as little as two maximal isometric contractions or 10-50 eccentric actions—significantly attenuates subsequent exercise-induced muscle damage, typically within a window of 1-2 weeks, regardless of exercise modality (downhill walking, elbow flexors, knee extensors) or contraction velocity; however, this protective effect is not sustained beyond 2-3 weeks.",
      "conclusionB": "Eccentric exercise, performed at a submaximal intensity, currently stands out as the most effective pre-conditioning strategy for reducing Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage (EIMD); however, the magnitude of this effect is significantly moderated by participant characteristics – notably training status and sex – and the specific muscle group targeted, necessitating individualized and nuanced application of pre-conditioning protocols."

    "referenceConclusion": "Pre-conditioning significantly reduced the severity of creatine kinase release, delayed-onset muscle soreness, loss of maximal voluntary contraction force and the range of motion decrease. Pre-conditioning may prevent severe EIMD and accelerate recovery of muscle force generation capacity. The current systematic review identified that pre-conditioning activities are effective in attenuating EIMD measures, CK, muscle soreness, ROM and maximal voluntary force production. These findings suggest the use of pre-conditioning activities prior to a strenuous bout of exercise does provide a significant protective effect when performed a minimum of 24 h prior to the damaging stimulus. Furthermore, the greater improvement in MVC suggests that the pre-conditioning activities may accelerate the recovery of muscle contractile properties following strenuous exercises. However, it is unclear if pre-conditioning would prevent EIMD from more complex exercises or to what extent EIMD prevention carries over into other modes of exercise.",

      "# Title: Muscle tenderness and peak torque changes after downhill running following a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: Unaccustomed exercise (usually of an eccentric nature) is often followed by delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Previous studies have found that prior eccentric activity produces a training effect which reduces DOMS and morphological changes. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a prior bout of maximal isokinetic eccentric exercise on DOMS, strength loss and plasma creatine kinase (CK) changes following a downhill run. Ten male subjects with a mean (+/- S.D.) age of 22.5 +/- 2.8 years, body mass of 62.67 +/- 0.05 kg and height of 176 +/- 3 cm were allocated to either a treatment group or a control group. The treatment group performed 100 maximal eccentric activations of the knee extensors in the dominant leg at 0.52 rad s-1. Two weeks later, the downhill run was performed on a motor-driven treadmill. This consisted of five bouts of 8 min at a gradient of -10% at a speed corresponding to 80% of the predicted maximal heart rate. The untrained group performed the downhill run as above but without the prior isokinetic session. Tenderness measurements, plasma CK activity and concentric and eccentric isokinetic peak torque measurements of the knee extensors at 0.52 and 2.83 rad s-1 were recorded prior to, immediately following and 2, 4 and 7 days after each protocol. The isokinetic protocol caused an increase (P < 0.01) in CK and tenderness and a decrease (P < 0.05) in concentric and eccentric torque at both speeds in the treatment group. Following the downhill run, a reduction in peak torque (P < 0.01) was observed in the eccentric and concentric modes at both isokinetic speeds in the control group. For the treatment group, the decrease in peak torque occurred only at the faster eccentric speed. With the exception of the faster eccentric speed, the decrement in peak torque was greater in the control group in all post-exercise isokinetic strength tests. There was less tenderness (P < 0.01) in the trained knee extensor muscle group. Peak torque also returned to pre-downhill values earlier for the trained group. Although plasma CK activity increased in both groups after downhill running, it was much lower (P < 0.01) in the trained group. The results suggest that a prior bout of isokinetic eccentric training reduces muscle damage, reduces the amount of strength loss and decreases the sensation of DOMS after downhill running.",
      "# Title: Exercise-induced skeletal muscle damage and adaptation following repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions.\n# Abstract: Repeated bouts of eccentric muscle contractions were used to examine indirect indices of exercise-induced muscle damage and adaptation in human skeletal muscle. Twenty-four subjects (18 females, 6 males) aged 20.0 +/- 1.4 years (mean +/- S.D.) performed an initial bout of either 10 (n = 7), 30 (n = 9) or 50 (n = 8) maximum voluntary eccentric contractions of the knee extensors, followed by a second bout of 50 contractions 3 weeks later using the same leg. Muscle soreness was elevated after all bouts (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon test), although the initial bout reduced the soreness associated with the second bout. Force loss and a decline in the 20:100 Hz percutaneous electrical myostimulation force ratio were observed after all exercise bouts (P < 0.01). Serum creatine kinase activity was elevated following the initial bouts of 30 and 50 repetitions (P < 0.01), but there was no increase following 10 repetitions. No increase in serum creatine kinase activity was observed in any group following the second bout of contractions (P > 0.05). We conclude that skeletal muscle adaptation can be brought about by a single bout of relatively few eccentric muscle contractions. Increasing the number of eccentric muscle repetitions did not result in an increased prophylactic effect on skeletal muscle.",
      "# Title: Influence of previous concentric exercise on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether a fatiguing concentric exercise performed immediately before eccentric exercise would exacerbate eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. One arm of nine female subjects (mean +/- s: 23.3 +/- 6.7 years) performed 12 maximal eccentric actions of the elbow flexors (ECC), and the other arm performed 100 repetitions of isokinetic concentric actions of the elbow flexors followed by the same eccentric exercise (CON-ECC). The two exercise regimens (ECC and CON-ECC) were separated by 2 weeks and presented in a counterbalanced order. Changes in muscle soreness level, maximal isometric force generation, relaxed and flexed elbow joint angle, upper arm circumference and plasma creatine kinase activity were compared between the ECC and CON-ECC conditions. All measures changed significantly after both ECC and CON-ECC; however, there were significant differences in the changes between the conditions. A lower level of soreness, a faster recovery of maximal isometric force generation, a smaller decrease in relaxed elbow joint angle and a smaller increase in upper arm circumference and creatine kinase activity were evident after the CON-ECC condition compared to the ECC condition. Thus, it would seem that muscle damage was attenuated by performance of previous concentric exercise. An additional experiment using a different group of subjects (n = 5) showed that warm-up exercise before the eccentric exercise also attenuated eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Acute adaptation to low volume eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: Many symptoms of eccentric muscle damage can be substantially reduced if a similar eccentric bout is repeated within several weeks of the initial bout. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a nondamaging, low repetition, low volume eccentric exercise bout could also provide a protective/adaptive effect.",
      "# Title: The repeated bout effect of reduced-load eccentric exercise on elbow flexor muscle damage.\n# Abstract: In this study we investigated the extent to which an initial eccentric exercise consisting of two (2ECC) or six maximal eccentric actions (6ECC) of the elbow flexors would produce a similar effect to 24 maximal eccentric actions (24ECC), on a second bout of 24ECC performed 2 weeks later. Male students (n = 34) were assigned to one of three groups, and with their non-dominant arm performed either 2ECC (n = 12), 6ECC (n = 10), or 24ECC (n = 12) as a first bout of exercise. Two weeks later all groups performed 24ECC. Maximal isometric strength, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration were assessed before, immediately after, and for 4 days after exercise. Changes in all variables were compared between the bouts and groups by a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance. All variables changed significantly (P< 0.05) after 2ECC, 6ECC, and 24ECC, but the amount of change after 2ECC and 6ECC was significantly smaller (P<0.05) than both 6ECC and 24ECC, and 24ECC, respectively. After the second bout, the 6ECC and 24ECC groups showed a profound repeated bout effect, and no significant differences were found between the groups. All variables except muscle soreness were significantly (P< 0.05) larger after the second bout for the 2ECC group, however the changes observed after 24ECC were significantly smaller (P < 0.01) than those observed after the first 24ECC of the 24ECC group. These results suggest that it is not necessary to conduct a high number of eccentric actions in the first bout to elicit a repeated bout effect in a subsequent bout performed some time later.",

      "# Title: Intensity of eccentric exercise, shift of optimum angle, and the magnitude of repeated-bout effect.\n# Abstract: This study compared the effect of four different intensities of initial eccentric exercise (ECC1) on optimum angle shift and extent of muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise. Fifty-two male students were placed into 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% groups (n = 13 per group), performing 30 eccentric actions of the elbow flexors of 100%, 80%, 60%, or 40% of maximal isometric strength [maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)] for ECC1, followed 2-3 wk later by a similar exercise (ECC2) that used 100% MVC load. MVC at six elbow joint angles, range of motion, upper arm circumference, serum creatine kinase activity, myoglobin concentration, and muscle soreness were measured before and for 5 days following ECC1 and ECC2. A rightward shift of optimum angle following ECC1 was significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 100% and 80% than for the 60% and 40% groups, and it decreased significantly (P < 0.05) from immediately to 5 days postexercise. By the time ECC2 was performed, only the 100% group kept a significant shift (4 degrees). Changes in most of the criterion measures following ECC1 were significantly greater for the 100% and 80% groups compared with the 60% and 40% groups. Changes in the criterion measures following ECC2 were significantly (P < 0.05) greater for the 40% group compared with other groups. Although the magnitude of repeated bout effect following ECC2 was significantly (P < 0.05) smaller for the 40% and 60% groups, all groups showed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced changes in criterion measures following ECC2 compared with the ECC1 100% bout. We conclude that the repeated-bout effect was not dependent on the shift of optimum angle.",
      "# Title: Repeated bout effect after maximal eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: We hypothesized that a bout of high or low volume eccentric exercise would protect against muscle damage following a subsequent high volume bout and that adaptation would be attributable to neural changes, independent of the initial exercise volume. Sixteen males performed either 45 (ECC45) or 10 (ECC10) maximal eccentric contractions using the elbow flexors, followed by an ECC45 bout 2 weeks later. Damage markers were measured for the following 96 h; EMG and work done during the first 10 eccentric contractions were also recorded. CK, soreness, and decrements in MVC and range of motion (ROM) were greater in bout 1 than bout 2 (p < 0.01). Soreness, MVC and ROM were greater after the initial ECC45 bout compared to the initial ECC10 bout and the repeated bouts of ECC45 exercise in both groups (p < 0.01). Median frequency decreased from bout 1 to bout 2 (p < 0.001), no differences between groups were observed. An ECC45 bout of maximal eccentric exercise causes more initial damage than an ECC10 bout of maximal eccentric exercise, although both confer protection from subsequent ECC45 bouts of maximal eccentric contractions, which are attributable, at least in part, to a shift in the frequency content of EMG.",
      "# Title: A light load eccentric exercise confers protection against a subsequent bout of more demanding eccentric exercise.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that a light eccentric exercise (ECC) that does not induce a loss of muscle function and delayed onset muscle soreness would confer a protective effect against a more strenuous ECC. Eighteen young men were randomly placed into two groups: 10-40% (n=9) and 40% (n=9). Subjects in the 10-40% group performed ECC of the elbow flexors (six sets of five reps) using a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (MVC) at an elbow joint angle of 90 degrees , followed 2 days later by ECC using a dumbbell weight of 40% MVC. Subjects in the 40% group performed the 40% ECC only. Changes in MVC, range of motion (ROM), upper arm circumference (CIR), plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and muscle soreness before, immediately after, 1-5 and 7 days following the 40% ECC were compared between groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any of the criterion measures were found immediately and 1-2 days after the 10% ECC. Following the 40% ECC, the 10-40% group showed significantly (P<0.05) smaller decreases in MVC and ROM, and smaller increases in muscle soreness compared with the 40% group, but no significant differences between groups were evident for CIR and plasma CK activity. These results suggest that the 10% ECC induced some protection against a subsequent bout of 40% ECC performed 2 days later. It appears that the light eccentric exercise preconditioned the muscles for exposure to the subsequent damaging eccentric exercise bout.",
      "# Title: Protection against muscle damage following fifty drop jumps conferred by ten drop jumps.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether 10 drop jumps (DJs) would confer protective effect against muscle damage and soreness in a subsequent bout of 50 DJs. Sixteen men were randomly placed into either a group performing 1 set of 10 DJs followed by 5 sets of 10 DJs (10-50, n = 8) or another group performing 2 bouts of 5 sets of 10 DJs (50-50, n = 8) separated by 2 weeks. The DJs were performed from a box height of 0.6 m, with a 10-second interval between jumps and a 1-minute rest between sets. Jump height, peak vertical ground reaction force, ground contact time, and heart rate during DJs were measured, and blood lactate concentration was assessed before and immediately after DJs. Changes in maximal isometric (ISO) and isokinetic concentric torque (CON), vertical jump, muscle soreness, and plasma creatine kinase activity before, immediately after, and at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours following exercise were compared between groups for the first and second bouts and between the bouts by a 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance. Changes in ISO, CON, vertical jump, and muscle soreness were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller for 10 DJs compared with 50 DJs; however, no significant differences in the measures between groups were evident following the second bout. The changes in the measures following 50 DJs in the 10-50 group were significantly (p < 0.05) smaller than those following the first bout of the 50-50 group. These results suggest that 10 DJs and 50 DJs conferred the same magnitude of protective effect against muscle damage by 50 DJs.",
      "# Title: Muscle damage protection by low-intensity eccentric contractions remains for 2 weeks but not 3 weeks.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the hypothesis that the protective effect conferred by a low-intensity eccentric exercise against maximal eccentric exercise would not last more than a week. Untrained men (21.3 ± 1.6 years) were allocated into either a control or one of four repeated bout groups (n = 13 per group). The repeated bout groups performed 30 low-intensity eccentric contractions (ECC) of the elbow flexors with a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (10%-ECC) either 2 days, 7 days (1 week), 14 days (2 weeks) or 21 days (3 weeks) before 30 maximal eccentric contractions (Max-ECC). The control group performed Max-ECC only. Changes in maximal voluntary contraction strength, optimum angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following 10%-ECC were analysed by a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Changes in the variables following Max-ECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. The 10%-ECC did not change any variables, showing no indication of muscle damage. The changes in all variables following Max-ECC were smaller (P < 0.05) for 2-day, 1- and 2-week groups than control group, without significant differences between 2-day and 1-week groups. The 2-week group showed greater (P < 0.05) changes in all variables compared with 2-day and 1-week groups. Changes in the variables were similar between 3-week and control groups, except for muscle soreness showing smaller (P < 0.05) changes for 3-week group. These results suggest that non-damaging eccentric exercise confers a protective effect against Max-Ecc, but the effect is attenuated between 1 and 2 weeks.",
      "# Title: Two maximal isometric contractions attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVC-ISO) would attenuate the magnitude of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. Young untrained men were placed into one of the two experimental groups or one control group (n = 13 per group). Subjects in the experimental groups performed either two or 10 MVC-ISO of the elbow flexors at a long muscle length (20° flexion) 2 days prior to 30 maximal isokinetic eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors. Subjects in the control group performed the eccentric contractions without MVC-ISO. No significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction peak torque, peak torque angle, range of motion, upper arm circumference, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and myoglobin concentration, muscle soreness, and ultrasound echo intensity were evident after MVC-ISO. Changes in the variables following eccentric contractions were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2 MVC-ISO group (e.g., peak torque loss at 5 days after exercise, 23% ± 3%; peak CK activity, 1964 ± 452 IU·L(-1); peak muscle soreness, 46 ± 4 mm) or the 10 MVC-ISO group (13% ± 3%, 877 ± 198 IU·L(-1), 30 ± 4 mm) compared with the control (34% ± 4%, 6192 ± 1747 IU·L(-1), 66 ± 5 mm). The 10 MVC-ISO group showed smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following eccentric contractions compared with the 2 MVC-ISO group. Therefore, two MVC-ISO conferred potent protective effects against muscle damage, whereas greater protective effect was induced by 10 MVC-ISO, which can be used as a strategy to minimize muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Attenuation of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage by preconditioning exercises.\n# Abstract: This study compared the effect of an initial exercise consisting of either low-intensity eccentric or maximal isometric contractions (ISOs) on protective effect against maximal eccentric contraction (MaxECC)-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions attenuate muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise of the knee extensors in the elderly.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors would attenuate the magnitude of muscle damage induced by maximal eccentric exercise of the same muscle performed 7 days later using elderly individuals. Healthy older men (66.4 ± 4.6 years) were assigned to control or experimental (Exp) group (n = 13 per group). The control group performed six sets of ten maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC) of the knee extensors of non-dominant leg. The Exp group performed six sets of ten low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors on a leg extension machine by lowering a weight of 10 % maximal voluntary isometric knee extension strength (10 %ECC) 7 days prior to MaxECC. Changes in maximal voluntary isokinetic concentric torque (MVC-CON), angle at peak torque, range of motion (ROM), upper thigh circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin (Mb) concentration and B-mode ultrasound echo-intensity before and for 5 days after MaxECC were compared between groups by a mixed factor ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were observed following 10 %ECC. Following MaxECC, all variables changed significantly, and changes in all variables except for angle at peak torque were significantly different between groups. MVC-CON and ROM decreased smaller and recovered faster (P < 0.05) for Exp than control group, and changes in other variables were smaller (P < 0.05) for Exp group compared with control group. These results suggest that preconditioning knee extensor muscles with low-intensity eccentric contractions was effective for attenuating muscle damage induced by subsequent MaxECC of the knee extensors for elderly individuals.",
      "# Title: Effect of two maximal isometric contractions on eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage of the elbow flexors.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the time wise protective effect conferred by two maximal voluntary isometric contractions (2MVCs) at 20° elbow flexion on muscle damage induced by 30 maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors (MaxECC). Sixty-five young untrained men were randomly assigned to a control group that did not perform 2MVCs, or one of four experimental groups (n = 13 per group) who performed 2MVCs either immediately (0d), 2 (2d), 4 (4d) or 7 days (7d) before MaxECC. Changes in maximal isokinetic (60° s(-1)) concentric torque (MVC-CON), optimum angle (OA), range of motion, upper arm circumference, muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration, and ultrasound echo-intensity following MaxECC were compared among the groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any variables were evident following 2MVCs. The 2d and 4d groups showed 16-62 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables following MaxECC than the control, 0d and 7d groups. The 2d group showed 14-34 % smaller (P < 0.05) changes in all variables except for OA compared with the 4d group. The changes in the variables were similar among the control, 0d and 7d groups. These results show that 2MVCs that were performed between 2 and 4 days before MaxECC attenuated the magnitude of muscle damage, but no such effect was evident if the 2MVCs were performed immediately or 7 days before MaxECC. It is concluded that the protective effect conferred by 2MVCs is relatively short-lived, and there is a window for the effect to be conferred.",
      "# Title: Effect of a prior bout of preconditioning exercise on muscle damage from downhill walking.\n# Abstract: This study investigated whether reduced-duration downhill walking (DW) would confer a protective effect against muscle damage induced by a subsequent bout of longer duration DW performed 1 week or 4 weeks later. Healthy young adults were allocated to a control or one of the preconditioning exercise (PRE-1wk or PRE-4wk) groups (10 men and 4 women per group). PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups performed 20-min DW (-28% slope, 5 km/h, 10% body mass added to a backpack) 1 week and 4 weeks before 40-min DW, respectively, and the control group performed 40-min DW only. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) knee extension torque, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity, and muscle soreness (100-mm visual analog scale) were measured before, immediately after, and 24, 48, and 72 h after DW, and the changes in these variables were compared among groups. The control group showed symptoms of muscle damage (e.g., prolonged decrease in MVC: -14% ± 10% at 48 h post-DW) after 40-min DW. Changes in all variables after 40-min DW of PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups were 54%-61% smaller (P < 0.05) than the control group, without significant differences between PRE-1wk and PRE-4wk groups for MVC and plasma CK activity. Importantly, changes after the preconditioning exercise (20-min DW) were 67%-69% smaller (P < 0.05) than those after the 40-min DW of the control group. These findings suggest that 20-min DW resulting in minor muscle damage conferred a protective effect against subsequent 40-min DW, and its effect could last for more than 4 weeks.",

      "# Title: Low-intensity eccentric contractions of the knee extensors and flexors protect against muscle damage.\n# Abstract: This study investigated the magnitude and duration of the protective effect of low-intensity eccentric contractions (LowEC) against damage induced by maximal eccentric contractions (MaxEC) of the knee flexors (KF) and extensors (KE). Young men were assigned to 8 experimental groups and 2 control groups (n = 13/group); the experimental groups performed LowEC of KF or KE 2 days (2d), 1 week (1wk), 2 weeks (2wk), or 3 weeks (3wk) before MaxEC, while the control groups performed MaxEC of KF or KE without LowEC. The 2d, 1wk, 2wk, and 3wk groups performed 30 LowEC of KF or 60 LowEC of KE with a load of 10% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction strength on a resistance-training machine, and all groups performed 30 MaxEC of KF or 60 MaxEC of KE on an isokinetic dynamometer. Several muscle damage markers were measured from before to 2 days after exercise (LowEC) or from before to 5 days after exercise (MaxEC). No significant changes in any variables were evident after LowEC. The changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (P < 0.05) for the 2d and 1wk groups (e.g., peak creatine kinase activity: 1002 ± 501 IU/L; peak muscle soreness: 13 ± 5 mm) than for the control group (peak creatine kinase activity: 3005 ± 983 IU/L; peak muscle soreness 28 ± 6 mm) for both KE and KF. There were no significant differences between the 2d and 1wk groups or among the 2wk, 3wk, and control groups. These results show that LowEC provided 30%-66% protection against damage induced by MaxEC of KF and KE, and the protective effect lasted 1 week.",

Untrained men were placed to an experimental group that performed 6 sets of 10 MVIC at 90° knee flexion 2 weeks before 6 sets of 10 MaxEC or a control group that performed MaxEC only (n = 13/group). Changes in muscle damage markers were assessed before to 5 days after each exercise. Small but significant changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction torque, range of motion (ROM) and plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity were evident at immediately to 2 days post-MVIC (p < 0.05), but other variables (e.g. thigh girth, myoglobin concentration, B-mode echo intensity) did not change significantly. Changes in all variables after MaxEC were smaller (p < 0.05) by 45% (soreness)-67% (CK) for the experimental than the control group. These results suggest that MVIC conferred potent protective effect against MaxEC-induced muscle damage.",
      "# Title: Prevention of downhill walking-induced muscle damage by non-damaging downhill walking.\n# Abstract: Mountain trekking involves level, uphill, and downhill walking (DW). Prolonged DW induces damage to leg muscles, reducing force generating ability and muscle coordination. These increase risks for more serious injuries and accidents in mountain trekking, thus a strategy to minimize muscle damage is warranted. It has been shown that low-intensity eccentric contractions confer protective effect on muscle damage induced by high-intensity eccentric contractions. This study tested the hypothesis that 5-min non-damaging DW would attenuate muscle damage induced by 40-min DW, but 5-min level walking (LW) would not.",
      "# Title: Isometric pre-conditioning blunts exercise-induced muscle damage but does not attenuate changes in running economy following downhill running.\n# Abstract: Running economy (RE) is impaired following unaccustomed eccentric-biased exercises that induce muscle damage. It is also known that muscle damage is reduced when maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) are performed at a long muscle length 2-4 days prior to maximal eccentric exercise with the same muscle, a phenomenon that can be described as isometric pre-conditioning (IPC). We tested the hypothesis that IPC could attenuate muscle damage and changes in RE following downhill running. Thirty untrained men were randomly assigned into experimental or control groups and ran downhill on a treadmill (-15%) for 30 min. Participants in the experimental group completed 10 MVIC in a leg press machine two days prior to downhill running, while participants in the control group did not perform IPC. The magnitude of changes in muscle soreness determined 48 h after downhill running was greater for the control group (122 ± 28 mm) than for the experimental group (92 ± 38 mm). Isometric peak torque recovered faster in the experimental group compared with the control group (3 days vs. no full recovery, respectively). No significant effect of IPC was found for countermovement jump height, serum creatine kinase activity or any parameters associated with RE. These results supported the hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in markers of muscle damage. The hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in RE was not supported by our data. It appears that the mechanisms involved in changes in markers of muscle damage and parameters associated with RE following downhill running are not completely shared.",

However, it is not known whether this strategy could be applied to other muscles. This study investigated whether 10% EC would confer damage protective effect on high-intensity eccentric contractions (80% EC) for nine different muscle groups.",
      "# Title: Protective Effect Conferred by Isometric Preconditioning Against Slow- and Fast-Velocity Eccentric Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage.\n# Abstract: We investigated if the same isometric preconditioning protocol (IPP) attenuates the magnitude of muscle damage induced by different maximal eccentric exercise protocols in the elbow flexors. Sixty-four untrained men were assigned to either two experimental or two control groups. Participants in the experimental groups performed an IPP prior to either slow (60°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-S) or fast (180°·s-1 - ISO + ECC-F) maximal eccentric contractions (MaxECC). Subjects in the control groups performed slow (ECC-S) or fast (ECC-F) MaxECC without IPP. Maximal isokinetic concentric torque (MVC), muscle soreness (SOR), and muscle thickness (MT) were assessed before, immediately after, and 1-4 days following the MaxECC. Significant (p < 0.05) group vs. time interactions were found for MVC (F = 4,517), SOR (F = 6,318), and MT (F = 1,863). The ECC-S group presented faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and MT and less (p < 0.05) SOR at 96 h post-MaxECC compared with ECC-F group. No significant differences in MVC and MT were found between ECC-S and ECC-F groups following MaxECC. The ISO + ECC-S group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of MVC and SOR compared to the ECC-S group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ECC-S in any variable. The ISO + ECC-F group showed faster (p < 0.05) recovery of all assessed variables compared with the ECC-F group. MVC was greater (p < 0.05) at 48-72 h, and SOR was less (p < 0.05) at 48-96 h in the ISO + ECC-F compared to the ECC-F group. No significant differences were evident between ISO + ECC-S and ISO + ECC-F for any variable. These results show that the IPP accelerated recovery of MVC and SOR for the slow-eccentric exercise condition and attenuated strength loss and SOR in addition to faster recovery of all assessed variables for the fast-eccentric exercise condition. Therefore, the IPP can be used as a strategy to attenuate and accelerate recovery of muscle damage induced by different-velocity eccentric exercises, resulting in greater protection against muscle damage induced by faster velocity."

      "conclusionA": "Performing a non-damaging, low-intensity bout of eccentric exercise, or even isometric contractions, performed between 2 and 4 days prior to a subsequent maximal eccentric exercise bout significantly attenuates markers of muscle damage, such as reduced soreness, smaller decrements in strength, and lower creatine kinase activity, demonstrating a protective effect that can last for at least 1-2 weeks.",
      "conclusionB": "Performing a prior bout of low-to-moderate volume eccentric or isometric exercise—even as little as two maximal isometric contractions or 10-50 eccentric actions—significantly attenuates subsequent exercise-induced muscle damage, typically within a window of 1-2 weeks, regardless of exercise modality (downhill walking, elbow flexors, knee extensors) or contraction velocity; however, this protective effect is not sustained beyond 2-3 weeks."

      "# Title: Implications of Extrathyroidal Extension Invading Only the Strap Muscles in Papillary Thyroid Carcinomas.\n# Abstract: Background: Based on the new TNM classification, differentiated thyroid carcinomas with extrathyroidal extension (ETE) into the strap muscles are designated as T3b. The current study analyzed the clinical significance of this new stage in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Subjects and Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 4045 eligible PTC patients. The patients were divided into four groups according to the extent of ETE: no ETE, ETE into perithyroidal tissue, T3b (ETE into the strap muscles), and ETE beyond the strap muscles. Differences in the clinical characteristics and prognosis of the four groups were assessed. Results: Of these 4045 patients, 2300 (56.9%) had no ETE, 1004 (24.8%) had ETE into perithyroidal tissue, 371 (9.2%) had ETE into the strap muscles, and 370 (9.1%) had ETE beyond the strap muscles. Tumor size, multifocality, lymph node metastasis (LNM), distant metastasis (DM), recurrence, and recurrence-free survival (RFS) between patients with ETE into perithyroidal tissue and patients without ETE did not show differences, but significant differences were observed between patients with T3b and patients without ETE, and only patients with ETE beyond the strap muscles had significantly worse overall survival (OS) than the other three groups. However, T3b did not independently predict worse RFS in univariable and multivariable analyses. Conclusions: T3b, distinguished from minimal ETE, may be related to larger tumor size, higher prevalence of multifocality, LNM, DM, recurrence, and worse RFS than no ETE, but it may not affect OS and may not independently predict recurrence in PTC patients.",
      "# Title: Is There a Difference Between Minimal and Gross Extension into the Strap Muscles for the Risk of Recurrence in Papillary Thyroid Carcinomas?\n# Abstract: Background: The morbidity of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is primarily related to locoregional recurrences and distant metastases. The definition of minimal extrathyroidal extension (mETE) has been recently revised. The presence of mETE does not impact mortality and is generally not considered to be a predictor for the risk of recurrence. This study aimed at comparing the risk of recurrence and the response to therapy of PTC with mETE and gross extrathyroidal extension (ETE) into the strap muscles (gETE) with low- and intermediate-risk PTC without ETE (low risk w/o ETE and intermediate risk w/o ETE, respectively) to further characterize the impact of ETE on outcomes. Methods: A total of 596 PTCs were analyzed according to the degree of ETE as well as other predictors of recurrence. Four groups of patients were compared, low risk w/o ETE (n = 251), intermediate risk w/o ETE (n = 89), mETE (n = 191), and gETE (n = 65), to determine the risk of recurrence and the response to treatment. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate associations between groups and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: The risk of recurrence was 3% in low risk w/o ETE PTC, 14% in intermediate risk w/o ETE, 14% in mETE, and 25% in gETE. The recurrence risk was increased by the presence of ETE (odds ratio [OR] = 2.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-5.85, p = 0.005) and lymph node metastases (OR = 2.44 [95% CI 1.25-4.76], p = 0.009). Patients with low-risk carcinomas w/o ETE experienced longer DFS than those with mETE (hazard ratio = 0.08 [95% CI 0.02-0.28], p < 0.001), but no significant difference was observed between intermediate risk w/o ETE, mETE, and gETE. In terms of the response to therapy, patients with gETE had higher rates of biochemical and/or structural incomplete responses within the first year of treatment (OR = 2.68 [95% CI 1.31-5.45], p = 0.007) and at the final follow-up evaluation (OR = 4.35 [95% CI 1.99-9.51], p < 0.001) compared with those with mETE. An analysis of the subgroups of microcarcinomas without lymph node metastases revealed no significant difference in DFS or the response to therapy between the low risk w/o ETE and mETE PTC groups. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that both mETE and gETE are independent risk factors for the risk of recurrence in PTC. Although gETE has a more pronounced impact on the recurrence risk and is associated with a worse response to therapy, mETE may not be associated with a low risk of recurrence. This observation suggests that patients with PTC and mETE may, in part, have an intermediate risk of recurrence and need to be followed accordingly."

A randomized, single-blind study was performed to evaluate the effects of the combination of high-dose furosemide and small-volume hypertonic saline solution (HSS) infusion in the treatment of refractory New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV CHF and a normosodic diet during follow-up. Materials and Methods One hundred seven patients (39 women and 68 men, age range 65-90 years) with refractory CHF (NYHA class IV) of different etiologies, who were unresponsive to high oral doses of furosemide, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digitalis, and nitrates, were enrolled. Inclusion criteria included an ejection fraction (EF) <35%, serum creatinine level <2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level < or =60 mg/dL, reduced urinary volume, and low natriuresis. The patients were randomized in 2 groups (single-blind). Patients in group 1 (20 women and 33 men) received an intravenous (IV) infusion of furosemide (500-1000 mg) plus HSS (150 mL of 1.4%-4.6% NACl) twice a day in 30 minutes. Patients in group 2 (19 women and 35 men) received an IV bolus of furosemide (500-1000 mg) twice a day, without HSS, during a period lasting 6 to 12 days. Both groups received IV KCl (20-40 mEq) to prevent hypokalemia. At study entry, all patients underwent a physical examination and measurement of body weight (BW), blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR), an evaluation of signs of CHF, and measurement of control levels of serum Na, K, Cl, bicarbonate, albumin, uric acid, creatinine, urea, and glycemia daily during hospitalization, and measurements of the daily output of urine for Na, K, and Cl. A chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram were obtained at study entry, during hospitalization, and at the time of discharge from the hospital. During the treatment and after discharge, the daily dietary Na intake was 120 mmol in group 1 versus 80 mmol in group 2, with a fluid intake of 1000 mL daily in both groups. An assessment of BW and 24-hour urinary volume, serum, and urinary laboratory parameters were performed daily until patients reached a compensated state, when IV furosemide was replaced with oral administration (250-500 mg/d).

The existing evidence shows that cognitive skills and CNS functions may be linked to an increased injury risk and diminish postinjury performance in athletes. Cortical reorganization may demand compensatory strategies and occupy cognitive reserve, which makes it difficult to manage dynamic environment in sports.

Alterations in the central nervous system also play a role, but their influence after injury, recovery, and recurrent injury remain unknown. Modern neuroimaging techniques can be used to elucidate the underlying functional and structural alterations of the brain that predicate the neuromuscular control adaptations associated with ACL injury. This knowledge will further our understanding of the neural adaptations after ACL injury and rehabilitation and in relation to injury risk.

      "# Title: Corticospinal and intracortical excitability differ between athletes early after ACLR and matched controls.\n# Abstract: Neuromuscular impairments, such as quadriceps weakness and activation deficits, persist after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Recent research demonstrating changes in the function of the primary motor cortex after ACLR posits that quadriceps impairments may be influenced by reduced corticospinal excitability. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the integrity of the neuromotor axis of the vastus medialis is altered in subjects 2 weeks post-ACLR compared to uninjured control subjects. Eighteen athletes 2 weeks post-ACLR and 18 age and sex matched uninjured control subjects participated in this cross-sectional study. We quantified corticospinal (resting motor threshold, RMT; motor evoked potential amplitudes at 120% RMT, MEP120 ) and intracortical (inhibition and facilitation) excitability using single and paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), respectively. We assessed spinal-reflex excitability (H-reflex amplitude normalized to maximal M-wave, H/M ratio) using peripheral stimulation. Subjects post-ACLR had higher RMTs (p = 0.001), greater MEP120 amplitudes (p = 0.001), and more asymmetric facilitation (p = 0.041) than the uninjured control subjects. No significant group differences were found for intracortical inhibition (p = 0.289) and H/M ratio (p = 0.332). Our findings indicate that both intracortical and corticospinal excitability of vastus medialis are bilaterally altered in subjects 2 weeks after ACLR. Given persistent neuromuscular deficits seen after ACLR, rehabilitation strategies targeting intracortical and corticospinal deficits may potentially improve clinical outcomes. © 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

      "# Title: Quadriceps muscle function following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: systemic differences in neural and morphological characteristics.\n# Abstract: Quadriceps muscle dysfunction is common following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Data considering the diversity of neural changes, in-concert with morphological adaptations of the quadriceps muscle, are lacking. We investigated bilateral differences in neural and morphological characteristics of the quadriceps muscle in ACLR participants (n = 11, month post-surgery: 69.4 ± 22.4) compared to controls matched by sex, age, height, weight, limb dominance, and activity level. Spinal reflex excitability was assessed using Hoffmann reflexes (H:M); corticospinal excitability was quantified via active motor thresholds (AMT) and motor-evoked potentials (MEP) using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Cortical activation was assessed using a knee flexion/extension task with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Muscle volume was quantified using structural MRI. Muscle strength and patient-reported outcomes were also collected. 2 × 2 RM ANOVAs were used to evaluate group differences. Smaller quadriceps muscle volume (total volume, rectus femoris, vastus medialis, and intermedius) and lower strength were detected compared to contralateral and control limbs. Individuals with ACLR reported higher levels of pain and fear and lower levels of knee function compared to controls. No differences were observed for H:M. ACLR individuals demonstrated higher AMT bilaterally and smaller MEPs in the injured limb, compared to the controls. ACLR participants demonstrated greater activation in frontal lobe areas responsible for motor and pain processing compared to controls, which were associated with self-reported pain. Our results suggest that individuals with ACLR demonstrate systemic neural differences compared to controls, which are observed concurrently with smaller quadriceps muscle volume, quadriceps muscle weakness, and self-reported dysfunction.",

We aimed to assess relationships between quadriceps corticomotor and neuromechanical function after ACL surgery, and to compare with contralateral and control limbs. 16 individuals after primary, unilateral ACL surgery and 16 sex- and age-matched controls participated. Corticomotor function was assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation, and quantified via active motor thresholds (AMT), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF). Neuromechanical function was quantified via electromechanical delay, early and late-phase rate of torque development (RTD0-50, RTD100-200), coefficient of variation, maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) torque, and central activation ratio. We observed significant correlations in the ACL limbs between: AMT and RTD0-50 (r = - 0.513, p = 0.031), SICI and RTD100-200 (r = 0.501, p = 0.048), AMT and SICI (r = - 0.659, p = 0.010), AMT and ICF (r = 0.579, p = 0.031), RTD0-50 and MVIC (r = 0.504, p = 0.023), and RTD100-200 and MVIC (r = 0.680, p = 0.002). The ACL limbs demonstrated higher AMT compared to controls (44.9 ± 8.4 vs. 30.1 ± 8.2%, p < 0.001), and lesser MVIC torque (2.37 ± 0.52 vs. 2.80 ± 0.59 Nm/kg, p = 0.005) and RTD100-200 (6.79 ± 1.72 vs. 7.90 ± 1.98 Nm/kg/s, p = 0.006) compared to the contralateral limbs. Our findings indicate that lesser corticospinal excitability is associated with lesser early-phase RTD, and greater intracortical inhibition is associated with lesser late-phase RTD. These findings provide evidence of implications of altered intracortical and corticospinal pathways relative to the ability to rapidly generate quadriceps torque following ACL surgery.",

      "# Title: Athletes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction demonstrate asymmetric intracortical facilitation early after surgery.\n# Abstract: Quadriceps dysfunction persists after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), yet the etiology remains elusive. Inhibitory and facilitatory intracortical networks (ie, intracortical excitability) may be involved in quadriceps dysfunction, yet the investigation of these networks early after ACLR is sparse. The purposes of this study were to examine (a) changes in intracortical excitability in athletes after ACLR compared to uninjured athletes during the course of postoperative rehabilitation, (b) the association between intracortical excitability and quadriceps strength in athletes after ACLR. Eighteen level I/II athletes after ACLR between the ages of 18 to 30 years and eighteen healthy sex, age, and activity matched athletes were tested at three-time points: (a) 2 weeks after surgery, (b) achievement of a \"quiet knee\" defined as full range of motion and minimal effusion, (c) return to running time point defined as achievement of a quadriceps index ≥80% and at least 12 weeks post-ACLR. Short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF), measured via transcranial magnetic stimulation and isometric quadriceps strength were examined bilaterally at each time point. There was a significant group × limb interaction (P = .017) for ICF. The ACLR group demonstrated asymmetric ICF (greater in the nonsurgical limb) compared to controls and a significant relationship between SICI and quadriceps strength of the surgical limb at the quiet knee time point (P = .018). ACLR individuals demonstrate differential effects on ICF between limbs. Also, SICI is associated with isometric quadriceps strength after ACLR, suggesting increased inhibition of the motor cortex may contribute to impaired quadriceps strength following ACLR.",

      "# Title: Neural activity for hip-knee control in those with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A task-based functional connectivity analysis.\n# Abstract: Anterior cruciate ligament injury may induce neurophysiological changes for sensorimotor control. Neuroimaging investigations have revealed unique brain activity patterns for knee movement following injury, indicating potential neural mechanisms underlying aberrant neuromuscular control that may contribute to heightened risk of secondary injury, altered movement patterns and poor patient outcomes. However, neuroimaging paradigms thus far have been limited to single joint, single motion knee tasks. Therefore, we sought to overcome prior limitations to understand the effects of injury on neural control of lower extremity movement by employing a multi-joint motor paradigm and determining differences in neural activity between ACL-reconstructed (ACLr) individuals relative to healthy matched controls. Fifteen patients with left anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and fifteen matched healthy controls participated in this study. Neural activity was examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging during a block-designed knee-hip movement paradigm (similar to a supine heel-slide). Participants for each group were monitored and task performance was controlled via a metronome to ensure the same spatial-temporal parameters. We observed that those with ACL reconstruction displayed increased activation within the intracalcarine cortex, lingual gyrus, occipital fusiform gyrus, lateral occipital cortex, angular gyrus, and superior parietal lobule relative to controls. A follow-up task-based functional connectivity analyses using seed regions identified from the group analysis revealed connectivity among fronto-insular-temporal and sensorimotor regions within the ACLr participants. The results of this fMRI investigation suggest ACLr individuals require increased activity and connectivity in areas responsible for visual-spatial cognition and orientation, and attention for hip and knee motor control."

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 49 patients with type 2 diabetes who underwent radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer in the Department of gastroenterology of the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University from Jan to Dec 2020. They were randomly divided into experimental group and control group according to different perioperative management measures. The perioperative C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell (WBC), interleukin-6(IL-6), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), blood glucose fluctuation and postoperative recovery were compared between the two groups. Results: A total of 49 patients were enrolled in the study (23 in the experimental group and 26 in the control group). The degree of stress reaction of the experimental group was lighter than that of the control group. The levels of CRP were significantly different on the 5th and 7th day after operation, IL-6 was significantly different on the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th day after operation, WBC and HOMA-IR were significantly different on the 1st day postoperatively. And the changes of HOMA-IR and blood glucose in experimental group were more gentle than those in control group. All the differences were statistically significant(P<0.05). In the experimental group, the time of first anal exhaust, indwelling time of drainage tube or nasointestinal tube and the total hospitalization time were significantly shorter than those of the control group(P<0.05).

      "# Title: Corticospinal and intracortical excitability differ between athletes early after ACLR and matched controls.\n# Abstract: Neuromuscular impairments, such as quadriceps weakness and activation deficits, persist after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Recent research demonstrating changes in the function of the primary motor cortex after ACLR posits that quadriceps impairments may be influenced by reduced corticospinal excitability. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the integrity of the neuromotor axis of the vastus medialis is altered in subjects 2 weeks post-ACLR compared to uninjured control subjects. Eighteen athletes 2 weeks post-ACLR and 18 age and sex matched uninjured control subjects participated in this cross-sectional study. We quantified corticospinal (resting motor threshold, RMT; motor evoked potential amplitudes at 120% RMT, MEP120 ) and intracortical (inhibition and facilitation) excitability using single and paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), respectively. We assessed spinal-reflex excitability (H-reflex amplitude normalized to maximal M-wave, H/M ratio) using peripheral stimulation. Subjects post-ACLR had higher RMTs (p = 0.001), greater MEP120 amplitudes (p = 0.001), and more asymmetric facilitation (p = 0.041) than the uninjured control subjects. No significant group differences were found for intracortical inhibition (p = 0.289) and H/M ratio (p = 0.332). Our findings indicate that both intracortical and corticospinal excitability of vastus medialis are bilaterally altered in subjects 2 weeks after ACLR. Given persistent neuromuscular deficits seen after ACLR, rehabilitation strategies targeting intracortical and corticospinal deficits may potentially improve clinical outcomes. © 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

We investigated bilateral differences in neural and morphological characteristics of the quadriceps muscle in ACLR participants (n = 11, month post-surgery: 69.4 ± 22.4) compared to controls matched by sex, age, height, weight, limb dominance, and activity level. Spinal reflex excitability was assessed using Hoffmann reflexes (H:M); corticospinal excitability was quantified via active motor thresholds (AMT) and motor-evoked potentials (MEP) using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Cortical activation was assessed using a knee flexion/extension task with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Muscle volume was quantified using structural MRI. Muscle strength and patient-reported outcomes were also collected. 2 × 2 RM ANOVAs were used to evaluate group differences. Smaller quadriceps muscle volume (total volume, rectus femoris, vastus medialis, and intermedius) and lower strength were detected compared to contralateral and control limbs. Individuals with ACLR reported higher levels of pain and fear and lower levels of knee function compared to controls. No differences were observed for H:M. ACLR individuals demonstrated higher AMT bilaterally and smaller MEPs in the injured limb, compared to the controls. ACLR participants demonstrated greater activation in frontal lobe areas responsible for motor and pain processing compared to controls, which were associated with self-reported pain.

We aimed to assess relationships between quadriceps corticomotor and neuromechanical function after ACL surgery, and to compare with contralateral and control limbs. 16 individuals after primary, unilateral ACL surgery and 16 sex- and age-matched controls participated. Corticomotor function was assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation, and quantified via active motor thresholds (AMT), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF). Neuromechanical function was quantified via electromechanical delay, early and late-phase rate of torque development (RTD0-50, RTD100-200), coefficient of variation, maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) torque, and central activation ratio. We observed significant correlations in the ACL limbs between: AMT and RTD0-50 (r = - 0.513, p = 0.031), SICI and RTD100-200 (r = 0.501, p = 0.048), AMT and SICI (r = - 0.659, p = 0.010), AMT and ICF (r = 0.579, p = 0.031), RTD0-50 and MVIC (r = 0.504, p = 0.023), and RTD100-200 and MVIC (r = 0.680, p = 0.002).

Neuromechanical function was quantified via electromechanical delay, early and late-phase rate of torque development (RTD0-50, RTD100-200), coefficient of variation, maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) torque, and central activation ratio. We observed significant correlations in the ACL limbs between: AMT and RTD0-50 (r = - 0.513, p = 0.031), SICI and RTD100-200 (r = 0.501, p = 0.048), AMT and SICI (r = - 0.659, p = 0.010), AMT and ICF (r = 0.579, p = 0.031), RTD0-50 and MVIC (r = 0.504, p = 0.023), and RTD100-200 and MVIC (r = 0.680, p = 0.002). The ACL limbs demonstrated higher AMT compared to controls (44.9 ± 8.4 vs. 30.1 ± 8.2%, p < 0.001), and lesser MVIC torque (2.37 ± 0.52 vs. 2.80 ± 0.59 Nm/kg, p = 0.005) and RTD100-200 (6.79 ± 1.72 vs. 7.90 ± 1.98 Nm/kg/s, p = 0.006) compared to the contralateral limbs. Our findings indicate that lesser corticospinal excitability is associated with lesser early-phase RTD, and greater intracortical inhibition is associated with lesser late-phase RTD. These findings provide evidence of implications of altered intracortical and corticospinal pathways relative to the ability to rapidly generate quadriceps torque following ACL surgery.",

      "# Title: Athletes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction demonstrate asymmetric intracortical facilitation early after surgery.\n# Abstract: Quadriceps dysfunction persists after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), yet the etiology remains elusive. Inhibitory and facilitatory intracortical networks (ie, intracortical excitability) may be involved in quadriceps dysfunction, yet the investigation of these networks early after ACLR is sparse. The purposes of this study were to examine (a) changes in intracortical excitability in athletes after ACLR compared to uninjured athletes during the course of postoperative rehabilitation, (b) the association between intracortical excitability and quadriceps strength in athletes after ACLR. Eighteen level I/II athletes after ACLR between the ages of 18 to 30 years and eighteen healthy sex, age, and activity matched athletes were tested at three-time points: (a) 2 weeks after surgery, (b) achievement of a \"quiet knee\" defined as full range of motion and minimal effusion, (c) return to running time point defined as achievement of a quadriceps index ≥80% and at least 12 weeks post-ACLR. Short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF), measured via transcranial magnetic stimulation and isometric quadriceps strength were examined bilaterally at each time point. There was a significant group × limb interaction (P = .017) for ICF. The ACLR group demonstrated asymmetric ICF (greater in the nonsurgical limb) compared to controls and a significant relationship between SICI and quadriceps strength of the surgical limb at the quiet knee time point (P = .018). ACLR individuals demonstrate differential effects on ICF between limbs. Also, SICI is associated with isometric quadriceps strength after ACLR, suggesting increased inhibition of the motor cortex may contribute to impaired quadriceps strength following ACLR.",

      "# Title: Neural activity for hip-knee control in those with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A task-based functional connectivity analysis.\n# Abstract: Anterior cruciate ligament injury may induce neurophysiological changes for sensorimotor control. Neuroimaging investigations have revealed unique brain activity patterns for knee movement following injury, indicating potential neural mechanisms underlying aberrant neuromuscular control that may contribute to heightened risk of secondary injury, altered movement patterns and poor patient outcomes. However, neuroimaging paradigms thus far have been limited to single joint, single motion knee tasks. Therefore, we sought to overcome prior limitations to understand the effects of injury on neural control of lower extremity movement by employing a multi-joint motor paradigm and determining differences in neural activity between ACL-reconstructed (ACLr) individuals relative to healthy matched controls. Fifteen patients with left anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and fifteen matched healthy controls participated in this study. Neural activity was examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging during a block-designed knee-hip movement paradigm (similar to a supine heel-slide). Participants for each group were monitored and task performance was controlled via a metronome to ensure the same spatial-temporal parameters. We observed that those with ACL reconstruction displayed increased activation within the intracalcarine cortex, lingual gyrus, occipital fusiform gyrus, lateral occipital cortex, angular gyrus, and superior parietal lobule relative to controls. A follow-up task-based functional connectivity analyses using seed regions identified from the group analysis revealed connectivity among fronto-insular-temporal and sensorimotor regions within the ACLr participants. The results of this fMRI investigation suggest ACLr individuals require increased activity and connectivity in areas responsible for visual-spatial cognition and orientation, and attention for hip and knee motor control."

      "# Title: Genome-wide survey reveals predisposing diabetes type 2-related DNA methylation variations in human peripheral blood.\n# Abstract: Inter-individual DNA methylation variations were frequently hypothesized to alter individual susceptibility to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Sequence-influenced methylations were described in T2DM-associated genomic regions, but evidence for direct, sequence-independent association with disease risk is missing. Here, we explore disease-contributing DNA methylation through a stepwise study design: first, a pool-based, genome-scale screen among 1169 case and control individuals revealed an excess of differentially methylated sites in genomic regions that were previously associated with T2DM through genetic studies. Next, in-depth analyses were performed at selected top-ranking regions. A CpG site in the first intron of the FTO gene showed small (3.35%) but significant (P = 0.000021) hypomethylation of cases relative to controls. The effect was independent of the sequence polymorphism in the region and persists among individuals carrying the sequence-risk alleles. The odds of belonging to the T2DM group increased by 6.1% for every 1% decrease in methylation (OR = 1.061, 95% CI: 1.032-1.090), the odds ratio for decrease of 1 standard deviation of methylation (adjusted to gender) was 1.5856 (95% CI: 1.2824-1.9606) and the sensitivity (area under the curve = 0.638, 95% CI: 0.586-0.690; males = 0.675, females = 0.609) was better than that of the strongest known sequence variant. Furthermore, a prospective study in an independent population cohort revealed significant hypomethylation of young individuals that later progressed to T2DM, relative to the individuals who stayed healthy. Further genomic analysis revealed co-localization with gene enhancers and with binding sites for methylation-sensitive transcriptional regulators. The data showed that low methylation level at the analyzed sites is an early marker of T2DM and suggests a novel mechanism by which early-onset, inter-individual methylation variation at isolated non-promoter genomic sites predisposes to T2DM.",
      "# Title: DNA methylation profiling identifies epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetic patients.\n# Abstract: In addition to genetic predisposition, environmental and lifestyle factors contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Epigenetic changes may provide the link for translating environmental exposures into pathological mechanisms. In this study, we performed the first comprehensive DNA methylation profiling in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We uncovered 276 CpG loci affiliated to promoters of 254 genes displaying significant differential DNA methylation in diabetic islets. These methylation changes were not present in blood cells from T2D individuals nor were they experimentally induced in non-diabetic islets by exposure to high glucose. For a subgroup of the differentially methylated genes, concordant transcriptional changes were present. Functional annotation of the aberrantly methylated genes and RNAi experiments highlighted pathways implicated in β-cell survival and function; some are implicated in cellular dysfunction while others facilitate adaptation to stressors. Together, our findings offer new insights into the intricate mechanisms of T2D pathogenesis, underscore the important involvement of epigenetic dysregulation in diabetic islets and may advance our understanding of T2D aetiology.",

      "# Title: Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of human pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic donors identifies candidate genes that influence insulin secretion.\n# Abstract: Impaired insulin secretion is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Epigenetics may affect disease susceptibility. To describe the human methylome in pancreatic islets and determine the epigenetic basis of T2D, we analyzed DNA methylation of 479,927 CpG sites and the transcriptome in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We provide a detailed map of the global DNA methylation pattern in human islets, β- and α-cells. Genomic regions close to the transcription start site showed low degrees of methylation and regions further away from the transcription start site such as the gene body, 3'UTR and intergenic regions showed a higher degree of methylation. While CpG islands were hypomethylated, the surrounding 2 kb shores showed an intermediate degree of methylation, whereas regions further away (shelves and open sea) were hypermethylated in human islets, β- and α-cells. We identified 1,649 CpG sites and 853 genes, including TCF7L2, FTO and KCNQ1, with differential DNA methylation in T2D islets after correction for multiple testing. The majority of the differentially methylated CpG sites had an intermediate degree of methylation and were underrepresented in CpG islands (∼ 7%) and overrepresented in the open sea (∼ 60%). 102 of the differentially methylated genes, including CDKN1A, PDE7B, SEPT9 and EXOC3L2, were differentially expressed in T2D islets. Methylation of CDKN1A and PDE7B promoters in vitro suppressed their transcriptional activity. Functional analyses demonstrated that identified candidate genes affect pancreatic β- and α-cells as Exoc3l silencing reduced exocytosis and overexpression of Cdkn1a, Pde7b and Sept9 perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion in clonal β- and α-cells, respectively. Together, our data can serve as a reference methylome in human islets. We provide new target genes with altered DNA methylation and expression in human T2D islets that contribute to perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion. These results highlight the importance of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of T2D.",
      "# Title: Altered DNA methylation and differential expression of genes influencing metabolism and inflammation in adipose tissue from subjects with type 2 diabetes.\n# Abstract: Genetics, epigenetics, and environment may together affect the susceptibility for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our aim was to dissect molecular mechanisms underlying T2D using genome-wide expression and DNA methylation data in adipose tissue from monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D and independent case-control cohorts. In adipose tissue from diabetic twins, we found decreased expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation; carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism; and increased expression of genes involved in inflammation and glycan degradation. The most differentially expressed genes included ELOVL6, GYS2, FADS1, SPP1 (OPN), CCL18, and IL1RN. We replicated these results in adipose tissue from an independent case-control cohort. Several candidate genes for obesity and T2D (e.g., IRS1 and VEGFA) were differentially expressed in discordant twins. We found a heritable contribution to the genome-wide DNA methylation variability in twins. Differences in methylation between monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D were subsequently modest. However, 15,627 sites, representing 7,046 genes including PPARG, KCNQ1, TCF7L2, and IRS1, showed differential DNA methylation in adipose tissue from unrelated subjects with T2D compared with control subjects. A total of 1,410 of these sites also showed differential DNA methylation in the twins discordant for T2D. For the differentially methylated sites, the heritability estimate was 0.28. We also identified copy number variants (CNVs) in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D. Taken together, subjects with T2D exhibit multiple transcriptional and epigenetic changes in adipose tissue relevant to the development of the disease.",
      "# Title: An integrated epigenomic analysis for type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci in monozygotic twins.\n# Abstract: DNA methylation has a great potential for understanding the aetiology of common complex traits such as Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here we perform genome-wide methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) in whole-blood-derived DNA from 27 monozygotic twin pairs and follow up results with replication and integrated omics analyses. We identify predominately hypermethylated T2D-related differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and replicate the top signals in 42 unrelated T2D cases and 221 controls. The strongest signal is in the promoter of the MALT1 gene, involved in insulin and glycaemic pathways, and related to taurocholate levels in blood. Integrating the DNA methylome findings with T2D GWAS meta-analysis results reveals a strong enrichment for DMRs in T2D-susceptibility loci. We also detect signals specific to T2D-discordant twins in the GPR61 and PRKCB genes. These replicated T2D associations reflect both likely causal and consequential pathways of the disease. The analysis indicates how an integrated genomics and epigenomics approach, utilizing an MZ twin design, can provide pathogenic insights as well as potential drug targets and biomarkers for T2D and other complex traits.",

      "# Title: Novel epigenetic determinants of type 2 diabetes in Mexican-American families.\n# Abstract: Although DNA methylation is now recognized as an important mediator of complex diseases, the extent to which the genetic basis of such diseases is accounted for by DNA methylation is unknown. In the setting of large, extended families representing a minority, high-risk population of the USA, we aimed to characterize the role of epigenome-wide DNA methylation in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Using Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays, we tested for association of DNA methylation at 446 356 sites with age, sex and phenotypic traits related to T2D in 850 pedigreed Mexican-American individuals. Robust statistical analyses showed that (i) 15% of the methylome is significantly heritable, with a median heritability of 0.14; (ii) DNA methylation at 14% of CpG sites is associated with nearby sequence variants; (iii) 22% and 3% of the autosomal CpG sites are associated with age and sex, respectively; (iv) 53 CpG sites were significantly associated with liability to T2D, fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance; (v) DNA methylation levels at five CpG sites, mapping to three well-characterized genes (TXNIP, ABCG1 and SAMD12) independently explained 7.8% of the heritability of T2D (vi) methylation at these five sites was unlikely to be influenced by neighboring DNA sequence variation. Our study has identified novel epigenetic indicators of T2D risk in Mexican Americans who have increased risk for this disease. These results provide new insights into potential treatment targets of T2D.",

      "# Title: Epigenome-wide association study identifies TXNIP gene associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and sustained hyperglycemia.\n# Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is an established risk factor for a wide range of vascular diseases, including ischemic stroke (IS). Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a marker for average blood glucose levels over the previous 12 weeks, is used as a measure of glycemic control and also as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes (HbA1c levels ≥ 6.5%). Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, may be associated with aging processes and with modulation of the risk of various pathologies, such as DM. Specifically, DNA methylation could be one of the mechanisms mediating the relation between DM and environmental exposures. Our goal was to identify new CpG methylation sites associated with DM. We performed a genome-wide methylation study in whole-blood DNA from an IS patient cohorts. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array was used to measure DNA methylation in CpG sites. All statistical analyses were adjusted for sex, age, hyperlipidemia, body mass index (BMI), smoking habit and cell count. Findings were replicated in two independent cohorts, an IS cohort and a population-based cohort, using the same array. In the discovery phase (N = 355), we identified a CpG site, cg19693031 (located in the TXNIP gene) that was associated with DM (P = 1.17 × 10(-12)); this CpG was replicated in two independent cohorts (N = 167 and N = 645). Methylation of TXNIP was inversely and intensely associated with HbA1c levels (P = 7.3 × 10(-16)), specifically related to diabetic patients with poor control of glucose levels. We identified an association between the TXNIP gene and DM through epigenetic mechanisms, related to sustained hyperglycemia levels (HbA1c ≥ 7%).",

Here we examine whether age-related epigenetic changes affect human islet function and if blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect these changes and associate with future T2D. We analyse DNA methylation genome-wide in islets from 87 non-diabetic donors, aged 26-74 years. Aging associates with increased DNA methylation of 241 sites. These sites cover loci previously associated with T2D, for example, KLF14. Blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related methylation changes in 83 genes identified in human islets (for example, KLF14, FHL2, ZNF518B and FAM123C) and some associate with insulin secretion and T2D. DNA methylation correlates with islet expression of multiple genes, including FHL2, ZNF518B, GNPNAT1 and HLTF. Silencing these genes in β-cells alter insulin secretion. Together, we demonstrate that blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related DNA methylation changes in human islets, and associate with insulin secretion in vivo and T2D.",

To conduct a genome-wide DNA methylation in individuals with type 2 diabetes, individuals with prediabetes, and control mixed ancestry individuals from South Africa. Methods. We used peripheral blood to perform genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in 3 individuals with screen detected diabetes, 3 individuals with prediabetes, and 3 individuals with normoglycaemia from the Bellville South Community, Cape Town, South Africa, who were age-, gender-, body mass index-, and duration of residency-matched. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) was performed by Arraystar Inc. (Rockville, MD, USA). Results. Hypermethylated DMRs were 1160 (81.97%) and 124 (43.20%), respectively, in individuals with diabetes and prediabetes when both were compared to subjects with normoglycaemia. Our data shows that genes related to the immune system, signal transduction, glucose transport, and pancreas development have altered DNA methylation in subjects with prediabetes and diabetes. Pathway analysis based on the functional analysis mapping of genes to KEGG pathways suggested that the linoleic acid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism pathways are hypomethylated in prediabetes and diabetes. Conclusions. Our study suggests that epigenetic changes are likely to be an early process that occurs before the onset of overt diabetes. Detailed analysis of DMRs that shows gradual methylation differences from control versus prediabetes to prediabetes versus diabetes in a larger sample size is required to confirm these findings.",
      "# Title: Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing of Human Pancreatic Islets Reveals Novel Differentially Methylated Regions in Type 2 Diabetes Pathogenesis.\n# Abstract: Current knowledge about the role of epigenetics in type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains limited. Only a few studies have investigated DNA methylation of selected candidate genes or a very small fraction of genomic CpG sites in human pancreatic islets, the tissue of primary pathogenic importance for diabetes. Our aim was to characterize the whole-genome DNA methylation landscape in human pancreatic islets, to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in diabetic islets, and to investigate the function of DMRs in islet biology. Here, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, which is a comprehensive and unbiased method to study DNA methylation throughout the genome at a single nucleotide resolution, in pancreatic islets from donors with T2D and control subjects without diabetes. We identified 25,820 DMRs in islets from individuals with T2D. These DMRs cover loci with known islet function, e.g., PDX1, TCF7L2, and ADCY5 Importantly, binding sites previously identified by ChIP-seq for islet-specific transcription factors, enhancer regions, and different histone marks were enriched in the T2D-associated DMRs. We also identified 457 genes, including NR4A3, PARK2, PID1, SLC2A2, and SOCS2, that had both DMRs and significant expression changes in T2D islets. To mimic the situation in T2D islets, candidate genes were overexpressed or silenced in cultured β-cells. This resulted in impaired insulin secretion, thereby connecting differential methylation to islet dysfunction. We further explored the islet methylome and found a strong link between methylation levels and histone marks. Additionally, DNA methylation in different genomic regions and of different transcript types (i.e., protein coding, noncoding, and pseudogenes) was associated with islet expression levels. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the islet DNA methylome in individuals with and without diabetes and highlights the importance of epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets and T2D pathogenesis."

Although these indicators have been applied widely for nursing home regulation, quality improvement, and public reporting, researchers and stakeholders have raised concerns about their accuracy and usefulness. We critically evaluate nursing home quality indicators from the standpoint of theory, measurement, and application, and we recommend strategies to make the indicators more valuable as quality assessment tools. We recommend that (a) more comprehensive quality indicators should be developed in conjunction with the new Minimum Data Set 3.0; (b) the validity and reliability of the indicators should be evaluated thoroughly with respect to both measurement and application; (c) statistical criteria should be incorporated explicitly into quality indicator scoring and outlier targeting; (d) the dimensionality and theoretical structure of the quality indicators should be carefully examined; (e) risk adjustment methods should be refined and broadened; and (f) quality indicator reporting systems should be strengthened and tailored to stakeholders' needs.",

      "# Title: Nutritional care; do process and structure indicators influence malnutrition prevalence over time?\n# Abstract: To date, no information is available about the effect of structural and process factors of nutritional care on the prevalence of malnutrition over time in the long-term care sector. This study analyzes the trend of malnutrition prevalence rates between 2007 and 2011 in the long-term care sector, and the related effects of(1) process indicators such as nutritional screening and treatment and 2) structural indicators (guideline, protocol or nutritional screening policy). From 2007 to 2011, the Dutch National Prevalence Measurement of Care Problems (LPZ) was performed in Dutch long-term care organizations using a standardized questionnaire involving measurements at institutional, ward and resident level. The data were analyzed by mixed-linear regression for longitudinal data. Presence of malnutrition was assessed by BMI, undesired weight loss and nutritional intake. Seventy-four care homes were included (26,101 residents). The malnutrition prevalence trend significantly decreased (P < 0.001) from 26% to 18% from 2007 to 2011. In the final model of the mixed effects analysis only the interacted process indicators nutritional screening and oral nutritional supplementation (ONS) were significant in influencing malnutrition prevalence rates over time. Structural indicators had no impact on the malnutrition prevalence over time. In conclusion, over time a lower prevalence of malnutrition is associated with a higher degree of nutritional screening.

      "# Title: Which characteristics of nursing home residents influence differences in malnutrition prevalence? An international comparison of The Netherlands, Germany and Austria.\n# Abstract: Prevalence rates of malnutrition vary considerably internationally, partly due to differences in measurement methodology and instruments. In the present study, the same measurement methodology and instruments were used in The Netherlands, Germany and Austria. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether resident characteristics influence possible differences in malnutrition prevalence between countries. The study followed a cross-sectional, multi-centre design that measured malnutrition in nursing home residents from The Netherlands, Germany and Austria. Resident data were gathered using a standardised questionnaire. Malnutrition was operationalised using BMI, unintentional weight loss and nutritional intake. Data were analysed using an association model. The prevalence rates of malnutrition in The Netherlands, Germany and Austria were 18·3, 20·1 and 22·5 %, respectively. The multivariate generalised estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression analysis showed that sex, age, care dependency, the mean number of diseases and some specific diseases were influencing factors for whether the resident was malnourished or not. The OR of malnutrition in the three countries declined after including the influencing factors resulting from the multivariate GEE analysis. The present study reveals that differences in the prevalence rates of malnutrition in nursing homes in The Netherlands, Germany and Austria are influenced by different resident characteristics. Since other country-related factors could also play an important role in influencing differences in the prevalence rates of malnutrition between the countries (structural and process factors of malnutrition care policy). We recommend the investigation of these factors in future studies.",

The current study analyzed the clinical significance of this new stage in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Subjects and Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 4045 eligible PTC patients. The patients were divided into four groups according to the extent of ETE: no ETE, ETE into perithyroidal tissue, T3b (ETE into the strap muscles), and ETE beyond the strap muscles. Differences in the clinical characteristics and prognosis of the four groups were assessed. Results: Of these 4045 patients, 2300 (56.9%) had no ETE, 1004 (24.8%) had ETE into perithyroidal tissue, 371 (9.2%) had ETE into the strap muscles, and 370 (9.1%) had ETE beyond the strap muscles. Tumor size, multifocality, lymph node metastasis (LNM), distant metastasis (DM), recurrence, and recurrence-free survival (RFS) between patients with ETE into perithyroidal tissue and patients without ETE did not show differences, but significant differences were observed between patients with T3b and patients without ETE, and only patients with ETE beyond the strap muscles had significantly worse overall survival (OS) than the other three groups. However, T3b did not independently predict worse RFS in univariable and multivariable analyses. Conclusions: T3b, distinguished from minimal ETE, may be related to larger tumor size, higher prevalence of multifocality, LNM, DM, recurrence, and worse RFS than no ETE, but it may not affect OS and may not independently predict recurrence in PTC patients.",
      "# Title: Is There a Difference Between Minimal and Gross Extension into the Strap Muscles for the Risk of Recurrence in Papillary Thyroid Carcinomas?\n# Abstract: Background: The morbidity of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is primarily related to locoregional recurrences and distant metastases. The definition of minimal extrathyroidal extension (mETE) has been recently revised. The presence of mETE does not impact mortality and is generally not considered to be a predictor for the risk of recurrence. This study aimed at comparing the risk of recurrence and the response to therapy of PTC with mETE and gross extrathyroidal extension (ETE) into the strap muscles (gETE) with low- and intermediate-risk PTC without ETE (low risk w/o ETE and intermediate risk w/o ETE, respectively) to further characterize the impact of ETE on outcomes. Methods: A total of 596 PTCs were analyzed according to the degree of ETE as well as other predictors of recurrence. Four groups of patients were compared, low risk w/o ETE (n = 251), intermediate risk w/o ETE (n = 89), mETE (n = 191), and gETE (n = 65), to determine the risk of recurrence and the response to treatment. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate associations between groups and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: The risk of recurrence was 3% in low risk w/o ETE PTC, 14% in intermediate risk w/o ETE, 14% in mETE, and 25% in gETE. The recurrence risk was increased by the presence of ETE (odds ratio [OR] = 2.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-5.85, p = 0.005) and lymph node metastases (OR = 2.44 [95% CI 1.25-4.76], p = 0.009). Patients with low-risk carcinomas w/o ETE experienced longer DFS than those with mETE (hazard ratio = 0.08 [95% CI 0.02-0.28], p < 0.001), but no significant difference was observed between intermediate risk w/o ETE, mETE, and gETE. In terms of the response to therapy, patients with gETE had higher rates of biochemical and/or structural incomplete responses within the first year of treatment (OR = 2.68 [95% CI 1.31-5.45], p = 0.007) and at the final follow-up evaluation (OR = 4.35 [95% CI 1.99-9.51], p < 0.001) compared with those with mETE. An analysis of the subgroups of microcarcinomas without lymph node metastases revealed no significant difference in DFS or the response to therapy between the low risk w/o ETE and mETE PTC groups. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that both mETE and gETE are independent risk factors for the risk of recurrence in PTC. Although gETE has a more pronounced impact on the recurrence risk and is associated with a worse response to therapy, mETE may not be associated with a low risk of recurrence. This observation suggests that patients with PTC and mETE may, in part, have an intermediate risk of recurrence and need to be followed accordingly."

      "# Title: Genome-wide survey reveals predisposing diabetes type 2-related DNA methylation variations in human peripheral blood.\n# Abstract: Inter-individual DNA methylation variations were frequently hypothesized to alter individual susceptibility to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Sequence-influenced methylations were described in T2DM-associated genomic regions, but evidence for direct, sequence-independent association with disease risk is missing. Here, we explore disease-contributing DNA methylation through a stepwise study design: first, a pool-based, genome-scale screen among 1169 case and control individuals revealed an excess of differentially methylated sites in genomic regions that were previously associated with T2DM through genetic studies. Next, in-depth analyses were performed at selected top-ranking regions. A CpG site in the first intron of the FTO gene showed small (3.35%) but significant (P = 0.000021) hypomethylation of cases relative to controls. The effect was independent of the sequence polymorphism in the region and persists among individuals carrying the sequence-risk alleles. The odds of belonging to the T2DM group increased by 6.1% for every 1% decrease in methylation (OR = 1.061, 95% CI: 1.032-1.090), the odds ratio for decrease of 1 standard deviation of methylation (adjusted to gender) was 1.5856 (95% CI: 1.2824-1.9606) and the sensitivity (area under the curve = 0.638, 95% CI: 0.586-0.690; males = 0.675, females = 0.609) was better than that of the strongest known sequence variant. Furthermore, a prospective study in an independent population cohort revealed significant hypomethylation of young individuals that later progressed to T2DM, relative to the individuals who stayed healthy. Further genomic analysis revealed co-localization with gene enhancers and with binding sites for methylation-sensitive transcriptional regulators. The data showed that low methylation level at the analyzed sites is an early marker of T2DM and suggests a novel mechanism by which early-onset, inter-individual methylation variation at isolated non-promoter genomic sites predisposes to T2DM.",
      "# Title: DNA methylation profiling identifies epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetic patients.\n# Abstract: In addition to genetic predisposition, environmental and lifestyle factors contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Epigenetic changes may provide the link for translating environmental exposures into pathological mechanisms. In this study, we performed the first comprehensive DNA methylation profiling in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We uncovered 276 CpG loci affiliated to promoters of 254 genes displaying significant differential DNA methylation in diabetic islets. These methylation changes were not present in blood cells from T2D individuals nor were they experimentally induced in non-diabetic islets by exposure to high glucose. For a subgroup of the differentially methylated genes, concordant transcriptional changes were present. Functional annotation of the aberrantly methylated genes and RNAi experiments highlighted pathways implicated in β-cell survival and function; some are implicated in cellular dysfunction while others facilitate adaptation to stressors. Together, our findings offer new insights into the intricate mechanisms of T2D pathogenesis, underscore the important involvement of epigenetic dysregulation in diabetic islets and may advance our understanding of T2D aetiology.",

Epigenetics may affect disease susceptibility. To describe the human methylome in pancreatic islets and determine the epigenetic basis of T2D, we analyzed DNA methylation of 479,927 CpG sites and the transcriptome in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We provide a detailed map of the global DNA methylation pattern in human islets, β- and α-cells. Genomic regions close to the transcription start site showed low degrees of methylation and regions further away from the transcription start site such as the gene body, 3'UTR and intergenic regions showed a higher degree of methylation. While CpG islands were hypomethylated, the surrounding 2 kb shores showed an intermediate degree of methylation, whereas regions further away (shelves and open sea) were hypermethylated in human islets, β- and α-cells. We identified 1,649 CpG sites and 853 genes, including TCF7L2, FTO and KCNQ1, with differential DNA methylation in T2D islets after correction for multiple testing. The majority of the differentially methylated CpG sites had an intermediate degree of methylation and were underrepresented in CpG islands (∼ 7%) and overrepresented in the open sea (∼ 60%). 102 of the differentially methylated genes, including CDKN1A, PDE7B, SEPT9 and EXOC3L2, were differentially expressed in T2D islets. Methylation of CDKN1A and PDE7B promoters in vitro suppressed their transcriptional activity. Functional analyses demonstrated that identified candidate genes affect pancreatic β- and α-cells as Exoc3l silencing reduced exocytosis and overexpression of Cdkn1a, Pde7b and Sept9 perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion in clonal β- and α-cells, respectively. Together, our data can serve as a reference methylome in human islets. We provide new target genes with altered DNA methylation and expression in human T2D islets that contribute to perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion. These results highlight the importance of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of T2D.",
      "# Title: Altered DNA methylation and differential expression of genes influencing metabolism and inflammation in adipose tissue from subjects with type 2 diabetes.\n# Abstract: Genetics, epigenetics, and environment may together affect the susceptibility for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our aim was to dissect molecular mechanisms underlying T2D using genome-wide expression and DNA methylation data in adipose tissue from monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D and independent case-control cohorts. In adipose tissue from diabetic twins, we found decreased expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation; carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism; and increased expression of genes involved in inflammation and glycan degradation. The most differentially expressed genes included ELOVL6, GYS2, FADS1, SPP1 (OPN), CCL18, and IL1RN. We replicated these results in adipose tissue from an independent case-control cohort. Several candidate genes for obesity and T2D (e.g., IRS1 and VEGFA) were differentially expressed in discordant twins. We found a heritable contribution to the genome-wide DNA methylation variability in twins. Differences in methylation between monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D were subsequently modest. However, 15,627 sites, representing 7,046 genes including PPARG, KCNQ1, TCF7L2, and IRS1, showed differential DNA methylation in adipose tissue from unrelated subjects with T2D compared with control subjects. A total of 1,410 of these sites also showed differential DNA methylation in the twins discordant for T2D. For the differentially methylated sites, the heritability estimate was 0.28. We also identified copy number variants (CNVs) in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D. Taken together, subjects with T2D exhibit multiple transcriptional and epigenetic changes in adipose tissue relevant to the development of the disease.",
      "# Title: An integrated epigenomic analysis for type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci in monozygotic twins.\n# Abstract: DNA methylation has a great potential for understanding the aetiology of common complex traits such as Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here we perform genome-wide methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) in whole-blood-derived DNA from 27 monozygotic twin pairs and follow up results with replication and integrated omics analyses. We identify predominately hypermethylated T2D-related differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and replicate the top signals in 42 unrelated T2D cases and 221 controls. The strongest signal is in the promoter of the MALT1 gene, involved in insulin and glycaemic pathways, and related to taurocholate levels in blood. Integrating the DNA methylome findings with T2D GWAS meta-analysis results reveals a strong enrichment for DMRs in T2D-susceptibility loci. We also detect signals specific to T2D-discordant twins in the GPR61 and PRKCB genes. These replicated T2D associations reflect both likely causal and consequential pathways of the disease. The analysis indicates how an integrated genomics and epigenomics approach, utilizing an MZ twin design, can provide pathogenic insights as well as potential drug targets and biomarkers for T2D and other complex traits.",

Using Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays, we tested for association of DNA methylation at 446 356 sites with age, sex and phenotypic traits related to T2D in 850 pedigreed Mexican-American individuals. Robust statistical analyses showed that (i) 15% of the methylome is significantly heritable, with a median heritability of 0.14; (ii) DNA methylation at 14% of CpG sites is associated with nearby sequence variants; (iii) 22% and 3% of the autosomal CpG sites are associated with age and sex, respectively; (iv) 53 CpG sites were significantly associated with liability to T2D, fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance; (v) DNA methylation levels at five CpG sites, mapping to three well-characterized genes (TXNIP, ABCG1 and SAMD12) independently explained 7.8% of the heritability of T2D (vi) methylation at these five sites was unlikely to be influenced by neighboring DNA sequence variation.

      "# Title: Epigenome-wide association study identifies TXNIP gene associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and sustained hyperglycemia.\n# Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is an established risk factor for a wide range of vascular diseases, including ischemic stroke (IS). Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a marker for average blood glucose levels over the previous 12 weeks, is used as a measure of glycemic control and also as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes (HbA1c levels ≥ 6.5%). Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, may be associated with aging processes and with modulation of the risk of various pathologies, such as DM. Specifically, DNA methylation could be one of the mechanisms mediating the relation between DM and environmental exposures. Our goal was to identify new CpG methylation sites associated with DM. We performed a genome-wide methylation study in whole-blood DNA from an IS patient cohorts. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array was used to measure DNA methylation in CpG sites. All statistical analyses were adjusted for sex, age, hyperlipidemia, body mass index (BMI), smoking habit and cell count. Findings were replicated in two independent cohorts, an IS cohort and a population-based cohort, using the same array. In the discovery phase (N = 355), we identified a CpG site, cg19693031 (located in the TXNIP gene) that was associated with DM (P = 1.17 × 10(-12)); this CpG was replicated in two independent cohorts (N = 167 and N = 645). Methylation of TXNIP was inversely and intensely associated with HbA1c levels (P = 7.3 × 10(-16)), specifically related to diabetic patients with poor control of glucose levels. We identified an association between the TXNIP gene and DM through epigenetic mechanisms, related to sustained hyperglycemia levels (HbA1c ≥ 7%).",

Here we examine whether age-related epigenetic changes affect human islet function and if blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect these changes and associate with future T2D. We analyse DNA methylation genome-wide in islets from 87 non-diabetic donors, aged 26-74 years. Aging associates with increased DNA methylation of 241 sites. These sites cover loci previously associated with T2D, for example, KLF14. Blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related methylation changes in 83 genes identified in human islets (for example, KLF14, FHL2, ZNF518B and FAM123C) and some associate with insulin secretion and T2D. DNA methylation correlates with islet expression of multiple genes, including FHL2, ZNF518B, GNPNAT1 and HLTF. Silencing these genes in β-cells alter insulin secretion. Together, we demonstrate that blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related DNA methylation changes in human islets, and associate with insulin secretion in vivo and T2D.",

Hypermethylated DMRs were 1160 (81.97%) and 124 (43.20%), respectively, in individuals with diabetes and prediabetes when both were compared to subjects with normoglycaemia. Our data shows that genes related to the immune system, signal transduction, glucose transport, and pancreas development have altered DNA methylation in subjects with prediabetes and diabetes. Pathway analysis based on the functional analysis mapping of genes to KEGG pathways suggested that the linoleic acid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism pathways are hypomethylated in prediabetes and diabetes. Conclusions. Our study suggests that epigenetic changes are likely to be an early process that occurs before the onset of overt diabetes. Detailed analysis of DMRs that shows gradual methylation differences from control versus prediabetes to prediabetes versus diabetes in a larger sample size is required to confirm these findings.",
      "# Title: Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing of Human Pancreatic Islets Reveals Novel Differentially Methylated Regions in Type 2 Diabetes Pathogenesis.\n# Abstract: Current knowledge about the role of epigenetics in type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains limited. Only a few studies have investigated DNA methylation of selected candidate genes or a very small fraction of genomic CpG sites in human pancreatic islets, the tissue of primary pathogenic importance for diabetes. Our aim was to characterize the whole-genome DNA methylation landscape in human pancreatic islets, to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in diabetic islets, and to investigate the function of DMRs in islet biology. Here, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, which is a comprehensive and unbiased method to study DNA methylation throughout the genome at a single nucleotide resolution, in pancreatic islets from donors with T2D and control subjects without diabetes. We identified 25,820 DMRs in islets from individuals with T2D. These DMRs cover loci with known islet function, e.g., PDX1, TCF7L2, and ADCY5 Importantly, binding sites previously identified by ChIP-seq for islet-specific transcription factors, enhancer regions, and different histone marks were enriched in the T2D-associated DMRs. We also identified 457 genes, including NR4A3, PARK2, PID1, SLC2A2, and SOCS2, that had both DMRs and significant expression changes in T2D islets. To mimic the situation in T2D islets, candidate genes were overexpressed or silenced in cultured β-cells. This resulted in impaired insulin secretion, thereby connecting differential methylation to islet dysfunction. We further explored the islet methylome and found a strong link between methylation levels and histone marks. Additionally, DNA methylation in different genomic regions and of different transcript types (i.e., protein coding, noncoding, and pseudogenes) was associated with islet expression levels. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the islet DNA methylome in individuals with and without diabetes and highlights the importance of epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets and T2D pathogenesis."

      "conclusionA": "Across multiple tissues and populations, altered DNA methylation is consistently associated with type 2 diabetes, with replicated findings demonstrating that differential methylation – particularly at sites near genes involved in glucose metabolism, insulin secretion, and inflammation (including *TXNIP*, *FTO*, *TCF7L2*, and *PPARG*) – contributes to disease pathogenesis and, in some cases, precedes disease onset; however, the magnitude of methylation changes is often modest and further research is needed to fully elucidate the functional implications of these epigenetic alterations.",

      "# Title: Comparisons of forward and backward gait between poorer and better attention capabilities in early Parkinson's disease.\n# Abstract: This study compared forward and backward gait between Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with poorer and better attention capabilities. PD and healthy control (HC) participants received a dual-stimuli attention task. The results were assessed using principal component analysis to quantify and rank attention capability. Accordingly, 22 PD and 42 HC subjects were equally divided into poorer (14 PD-P, 18 HC-P) and better (8 PD-B, 24 HC-B) attention capabilities. To analyze the spatiotemporal gait parameters, each participant walked forwards and backwards on a GAITRite(®) walkway. Compared to HC, PD performed worse in the dual task and exhibited slower velocity, less swing, and shorter stride in both walking directions. Notably, PD-P experienced all these gait defects, regardless of directions. PD-B walked worse than HC-B backwards, and displayed comparable gait to HC-P in both directions. In PD and HC, velocity, stride, and swing decreased perceptibly when walking backwards compared to forwards, and the same was true for velocity and stride in PD-P and PD-B. Backward strides were reduced evidently more in PD-P than in PD-B. However, backward swing reductions in PD-P and PD-B were statistically insignificant. Cadence in both directions was similar within the groups and between the groups, and there were little alterations between directions within each group and between groups. These results suggest that attention capability may affect PD gait. Poorer attention exacerbates gait defects and better attention improves gait in both directions. These results may support the application of cuing strategies in PD to enhance attention capability and improve walking gait.",
      "# Title: Investigation of factors impacting mobility and gait in Parkinson disease.\n# Abstract: Mobility and gait limitations are major issues for people with Parkinson disease (PD). Identification of factors that contribute to these impairments may inform treatment and intervention strategies. In this study we investigated factors that predict mobility and gait impairment in PD. Participants with mild to moderate PD and without dementia (n=114) were tested in one session 'off' medication. Mobility measures included the 6-Minute Walk test and Timed-Up-and-Go. Gait velocity was collected in four conditions: forward preferred speed, forward dual task, forward fast as possible and backward walking. The predictors analyzed were age, gender, disease severity, balance, balance confidence, fall history, self-reported physical activity, and executive function. Multiple regression models were used to assess the relationships between predictors and outcomes. The predictors, in different combinations for each outcome measure, explained 55.7% to 66.9% of variability for mobility and 39.5% to 52.8% for gait velocity. Balance was the most relevant factor (explaining up to 54.1% of variance in mobility and up to 45.6% in gait velocity). Balance confidence contributed to a lesser extent (2.0% to 8.2% of variance) in all models. Age explained a small percentage of variance in mobility and gait velocity (up to 2.9%). Executive function explained 3.0% of variance during forward walking only. The strong predictive relationships between balance deficits and mobility and gait impairment suggest targeting balance deficits may be particularly important for improving mobility and gait in people with PD, regardless of an individual's age, disease severity, fall history, or other demographic features."

    "referenceConclusion": "The primary goal of this review was to scope evidence regarding neurocognitive and neurophysiological functions that could be related to ACL injury in athletes and to synthesize them into RTS and rehabilitation paradigms. The existing evidence shows that cognitive skills and CNS functions may be linked to an increased injury risk and diminish postinjury performance in athletes. Cortical reorganization may demand compensatory strategies and occupy cognitive reserve, which makes it difficult to manage dynamic environment in sports. RTS and rehabilitation concepts should consider this notion to prevent second injuries and to achieve an adequate competitive level in athletes.",

Alterations in the central nervous system also play a role, but their influence after injury, recovery, and recurrent injury remain unknown. Modern neuroimaging techniques can be used to elucidate the underlying functional and structural alterations of the brain that predicate the neuromuscular control adaptations associated with ACL injury. This knowledge will further our understanding of the neural adaptations after ACL injury and rehabilitation and in relation to injury risk. In this paper, we describe the measurement of brain activation during knee extension-flexion after ACL injury and reconstruction and 26 days before a contralateral ACL injury.",
      "# Title: Corticospinal and intracortical excitability differ between athletes early after ACLR and matched controls.\n# Abstract: Neuromuscular impairments, such as quadriceps weakness and activation deficits, persist after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Recent research demonstrating changes in the function of the primary motor cortex after ACLR posits that quadriceps impairments may be influenced by reduced corticospinal excitability. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the integrity of the neuromotor axis of the vastus medialis is altered in subjects 2 weeks post-ACLR compared to uninjured control subjects. Eighteen athletes 2 weeks post-ACLR and 18 age and sex matched uninjured control subjects participated in this cross-sectional study. We quantified corticospinal (resting motor threshold, RMT; motor evoked potential amplitudes at 120% RMT, MEP120 ) and intracortical (inhibition and facilitation) excitability using single and paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), respectively. We assessed spinal-reflex excitability (H-reflex amplitude normalized to maximal M-wave, H/M ratio) using peripheral stimulation. Subjects post-ACLR had higher RMTs (p = 0.001), greater MEP120 amplitudes (p = 0.001), and more asymmetric facilitation (p = 0.041) than the uninjured control subjects. No significant group differences were found for intracortical inhibition (p = 0.289) and H/M ratio (p = 0.332). Our findings indicate that both intracortical and corticospinal excitability of vastus medialis are bilaterally altered in subjects 2 weeks after ACLR. Given persistent neuromuscular deficits seen after ACLR, rehabilitation strategies targeting intracortical and corticospinal deficits may potentially improve clinical outcomes. © 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

      "# Title: Quadriceps muscle function following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: systemic differences in neural and morphological characteristics.\n# Abstract: Quadriceps muscle dysfunction is common following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Data considering the diversity of neural changes, in-concert with morphological adaptations of the quadriceps muscle, are lacking. We investigated bilateral differences in neural and morphological characteristics of the quadriceps muscle in ACLR participants (n = 11, month post-surgery: 69.4 ± 22.4) compared to controls matched by sex, age, height, weight, limb dominance, and activity level. Spinal reflex excitability was assessed using Hoffmann reflexes (H:M); corticospinal excitability was quantified via active motor thresholds (AMT) and motor-evoked potentials (MEP) using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Cortical activation was assessed using a knee flexion/extension task with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Muscle volume was quantified using structural MRI. Muscle strength and patient-reported outcomes were also collected. 2 × 2 RM ANOVAs were used to evaluate group differences. Smaller quadriceps muscle volume (total volume, rectus femoris, vastus medialis, and intermedius) and lower strength were detected compared to contralateral and control limbs. Individuals with ACLR reported higher levels of pain and fear and lower levels of knee function compared to controls. No differences were observed for H:M. ACLR individuals demonstrated higher AMT bilaterally and smaller MEPs in the injured limb, compared to the controls. ACLR participants demonstrated greater activation in frontal lobe areas responsible for motor and pain processing compared to controls, which were associated with self-reported pain. Our results suggest that individuals with ACLR demonstrate systemic neural differences compared to controls, which are observed concurrently with smaller quadriceps muscle volume, quadriceps muscle weakness, and self-reported dysfunction.",

      "# Title: Corticomotor function is associated with quadriceps rate of torque development in individuals with ACL surgery.\n# Abstract: Impaired corticomotor function arising from altered intracortical and corticospinal pathways are theorized to impede muscle recovery following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) surgery, yet functional implications of centrally driven adaptations remain unclear. We aimed to assess relationships between quadriceps corticomotor and neuromechanical function after ACL surgery, and to compare with contralateral and control limbs. 16 individuals after primary, unilateral ACL surgery and 16 sex- and age-matched controls participated. Corticomotor function was assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation, and quantified via active motor thresholds (AMT), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF). Neuromechanical function was quantified via electromechanical delay, early and late-phase rate of torque development (RTD0-50, RTD100-200), coefficient of variation, maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) torque, and central activation ratio. We observed significant correlations in the ACL limbs between: AMT and RTD0-50 (r = - 0.513, p = 0.031), SICI and RTD100-200 (r = 0.501, p = 0.048), AMT and SICI (r = - 0.659, p = 0.010), AMT and ICF (r = 0.579, p = 0.031), RTD0-50 and MVIC (r = 0.504, p = 0.023), and RTD100-200 and MVIC (r = 0.680, p = 0.002). The ACL limbs demonstrated higher AMT compared to controls (44.9 ± 8.4 vs. 30.1 ± 8.2%, p < 0.001), and lesser MVIC torque (2.37 ± 0.52 vs. 2.80 ± 0.59 Nm/kg, p = 0.005) and RTD100-200 (6.79 ± 1.72 vs. 7.90 ± 1.98 Nm/kg/s, p = 0.006) compared to the contralateral limbs. Our findings indicate that lesser corticospinal excitability is associated with lesser early-phase RTD, and greater intracortical inhibition is associated with lesser late-phase RTD. These findings provide evidence of implications of altered intracortical and corticospinal pathways relative to the ability to rapidly generate quadriceps torque following ACL surgery.",

      "# Title: Athletes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction demonstrate asymmetric intracortical facilitation early after surgery.\n# Abstract: Quadriceps dysfunction persists after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), yet the etiology remains elusive. Inhibitory and facilitatory intracortical networks (ie, intracortical excitability) may be involved in quadriceps dysfunction, yet the investigation of these networks early after ACLR is sparse. The purposes of this study were to examine (a) changes in intracortical excitability in athletes after ACLR compared to uninjured athletes during the course of postoperative rehabilitation, (b) the association between intracortical excitability and quadriceps strength in athletes after ACLR. Eighteen level I/II athletes after ACLR between the ages of 18 to 30 years and eighteen healthy sex, age, and activity matched athletes were tested at three-time points: (a) 2 weeks after surgery, (b) achievement of a \"quiet knee\" defined as full range of motion and minimal effusion, (c) return to running time point defined as achievement of a quadriceps index ≥80% and at least 12 weeks post-ACLR. Short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF), measured via transcranial magnetic stimulation and isometric quadriceps strength were examined bilaterally at each time point. There was a significant group × limb interaction (P = .017) for ICF. The ACLR group demonstrated asymmetric ICF (greater in the nonsurgical limb) compared to controls and a significant relationship between SICI and quadriceps strength of the surgical limb at the quiet knee time point (P = .018). ACLR individuals demonstrate differential effects on ICF between limbs. Also, SICI is associated with isometric quadriceps strength after ACLR, suggesting increased inhibition of the motor cortex may contribute to impaired quadriceps strength following ACLR.",

      "# Title: Neural activity for hip-knee control in those with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A task-based functional connectivity analysis.\n# Abstract: Anterior cruciate ligament injury may induce neurophysiological changes for sensorimotor control. Neuroimaging investigations have revealed unique brain activity patterns for knee movement following injury, indicating potential neural mechanisms underlying aberrant neuromuscular control that may contribute to heightened risk of secondary injury, altered movement patterns and poor patient outcomes. However, neuroimaging paradigms thus far have been limited to single joint, single motion knee tasks. Therefore, we sought to overcome prior limitations to understand the effects of injury on neural control of lower extremity movement by employing a multi-joint motor paradigm and determining differences in neural activity between ACL-reconstructed (ACLr) individuals relative to healthy matched controls. Fifteen patients with left anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and fifteen matched healthy controls participated in this study. Neural activity was examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging during a block-designed knee-hip movement paradigm (similar to a supine heel-slide). Participants for each group were monitored and task performance was controlled via a metronome to ensure the same spatial-temporal parameters. We observed that those with ACL reconstruction displayed increased activation within the intracalcarine cortex, lingual gyrus, occipital fusiform gyrus, lateral occipital cortex, angular gyrus, and superior parietal lobule relative to controls. A follow-up task-based functional connectivity analyses using seed regions identified from the group analysis revealed connectivity among fronto-insular-temporal and sensorimotor regions within the ACLr participants. The results of this fMRI investigation suggest ACLr individuals require increased activity and connectivity in areas responsible for visual-spatial cognition and orientation, and attention for hip and knee motor control."

Sequence-influenced methylations were described in T2DM-associated genomic regions, but evidence for direct, sequence-independent association with disease risk is missing. Here, we explore disease-contributing DNA methylation through a stepwise study design: first, a pool-based, genome-scale screen among 1169 case and control individuals revealed an excess of differentially methylated sites in genomic regions that were previously associated with T2DM through genetic studies. Next, in-depth analyses were performed at selected top-ranking regions. A CpG site in the first intron of the FTO gene showed small (3.35%) but significant (P = 0.000021) hypomethylation of cases relative to controls. The effect was independent of the sequence polymorphism in the region and persists among individuals carrying the sequence-risk alleles. The odds of belonging to the T2DM group increased by 6.1% for every 1% decrease in methylation (OR = 1.061, 95% CI: 1.032-1.090), the odds ratio for decrease of 1 standard deviation of methylation (adjusted to gender) was 1.5856 (95% CI: 1.2824-1.9606) and the sensitivity (area under the curve = 0.638, 95% CI: 0.586-0.690; males = 0.675, females = 0.609) was better than that of the strongest known sequence variant. Furthermore, a prospective study in an independent population cohort revealed significant hypomethylation of young individuals that later progressed to T2DM, relative to the individuals who stayed healthy. Further genomic analysis revealed co-localization with gene enhancers and with binding sites for methylation-sensitive transcriptional regulators. The data showed that low methylation level at the analyzed sites is an early marker of T2DM and suggests a novel mechanism by which early-onset, inter-individual methylation variation at isolated non-promoter genomic sites predisposes to T2DM.",
      "# Title: DNA methylation profiling identifies epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetic patients.\n# Abstract: In addition to genetic predisposition, environmental and lifestyle factors contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Epigenetic changes may provide the link for translating environmental exposures into pathological mechanisms. In this study, we performed the first comprehensive DNA methylation profiling in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We uncovered 276 CpG loci affiliated to promoters of 254 genes displaying significant differential DNA methylation in diabetic islets. These methylation changes were not present in blood cells from T2D individuals nor were they experimentally induced in non-diabetic islets by exposure to high glucose. For a subgroup of the differentially methylated genes, concordant transcriptional changes were present. Functional annotation of the aberrantly methylated genes and RNAi experiments highlighted pathways implicated in β-cell survival and function; some are implicated in cellular dysfunction while others facilitate adaptation to stressors. Together, our findings offer new insights into the intricate mechanisms of T2D pathogenesis, underscore the important involvement of epigenetic dysregulation in diabetic islets and may advance our understanding of T2D aetiology.",

      "# Title: Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of human pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic donors identifies candidate genes that influence insulin secretion.\n# Abstract: Impaired insulin secretion is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Epigenetics may affect disease susceptibility. To describe the human methylome in pancreatic islets and determine the epigenetic basis of T2D, we analyzed DNA methylation of 479,927 CpG sites and the transcriptome in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We provide a detailed map of the global DNA methylation pattern in human islets, β- and α-cells. Genomic regions close to the transcription start site showed low degrees of methylation and regions further away from the transcription start site such as the gene body, 3'UTR and intergenic regions showed a higher degree of methylation. While CpG islands were hypomethylated, the surrounding 2 kb shores showed an intermediate degree of methylation, whereas regions further away (shelves and open sea) were hypermethylated in human islets, β- and α-cells. We identified 1,649 CpG sites and 853 genes, including TCF7L2, FTO and KCNQ1, with differential DNA methylation in T2D islets after correction for multiple testing. The majority of the differentially methylated CpG sites had an intermediate degree of methylation and were underrepresented in CpG islands (∼ 7%) and overrepresented in the open sea (∼ 60%). 102 of the differentially methylated genes, including CDKN1A, PDE7B, SEPT9 and EXOC3L2, were differentially expressed in T2D islets. Methylation of CDKN1A and PDE7B promoters in vitro suppressed their transcriptional activity. Functional analyses demonstrated that identified candidate genes affect pancreatic β- and α-cells as Exoc3l silencing reduced exocytosis and overexpression of Cdkn1a, Pde7b and Sept9 perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion in clonal β- and α-cells, respectively. Together, our data can serve as a reference methylome in human islets. We provide new target genes with altered DNA methylation and expression in human T2D islets that contribute to perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion. These results highlight the importance of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of T2D.",
      "# Title: Altered DNA methylation and differential expression of genes influencing metabolism and inflammation in adipose tissue from subjects with type 2 diabetes.\n# Abstract: Genetics, epigenetics, and environment may together affect the susceptibility for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our aim was to dissect molecular mechanisms underlying T2D using genome-wide expression and DNA methylation data in adipose tissue from monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D and independent case-control cohorts. In adipose tissue from diabetic twins, we found decreased expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation; carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism; and increased expression of genes involved in inflammation and glycan degradation. The most differentially expressed genes included ELOVL6, GYS2, FADS1, SPP1 (OPN), CCL18, and IL1RN. We replicated these results in adipose tissue from an independent case-control cohort. Several candidate genes for obesity and T2D (e.g., IRS1 and VEGFA) were differentially expressed in discordant twins. We found a heritable contribution to the genome-wide DNA methylation variability in twins. Differences in methylation between monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D were subsequently modest. However, 15,627 sites, representing 7,046 genes including PPARG, KCNQ1, TCF7L2, and IRS1, showed differential DNA methylation in adipose tissue from unrelated subjects with T2D compared with control subjects.

      "# Title: An integrated epigenomic analysis for type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci in monozygotic twins.\n# Abstract: DNA methylation has a great potential for understanding the aetiology of common complex traits such as Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here we perform genome-wide methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) in whole-blood-derived DNA from 27 monozygotic twin pairs and follow up results with replication and integrated omics analyses. We identify predominately hypermethylated T2D-related differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and replicate the top signals in 42 unrelated T2D cases and 221 controls. The strongest signal is in the promoter of the MALT1 gene, involved in insulin and glycaemic pathways, and related to taurocholate levels in blood. Integrating the DNA methylome findings with T2D GWAS meta-analysis results reveals a strong enrichment for DMRs in T2D-susceptibility loci. We also detect signals specific to T2D-discordant twins in the GPR61 and PRKCB genes. These replicated T2D associations reflect both likely causal and consequential pathways of the disease. The analysis indicates how an integrated genomics and epigenomics approach, utilizing an MZ twin design, can provide pathogenic insights as well as potential drug targets and biomarkers for T2D and other complex traits.",

      "# Title: Novel epigenetic determinants of type 2 diabetes in Mexican-American families.\n# Abstract: Although DNA methylation is now recognized as an important mediator of complex diseases, the extent to which the genetic basis of such diseases is accounted for by DNA methylation is unknown. In the setting of large, extended families representing a minority, high-risk population of the USA, we aimed to characterize the role of epigenome-wide DNA methylation in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Using Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays, we tested for association of DNA methylation at 446 356 sites with age, sex and phenotypic traits related to T2D in 850 pedigreed Mexican-American individuals. Robust statistical analyses showed that (i) 15% of the methylome is significantly heritable, with a median heritability of 0.14; (ii) DNA methylation at 14% of CpG sites is associated with nearby sequence variants; (iii) 22% and 3% of the autosomal CpG sites are associated with age and sex, respectively; (iv) 53 CpG sites were significantly associated with liability to T2D, fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance; (v) DNA methylation levels at five CpG sites, mapping to three well-characterized genes (TXNIP, ABCG1 and SAMD12) independently explained 7.8% of the heritability of T2D (vi) methylation at these five sites was unlikely to be influenced by neighboring DNA sequence variation. Our study has identified novel epigenetic indicators of T2D risk in Mexican Americans who have increased risk for this disease. These results provide new insights into potential treatment targets of T2D.",

      "# Title: Epigenome-wide association study identifies TXNIP gene associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and sustained hyperglycemia.\n# Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is an established risk factor for a wide range of vascular diseases, including ischemic stroke (IS). Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a marker for average blood glucose levels over the previous 12 weeks, is used as a measure of glycemic control and also as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes (HbA1c levels ≥ 6.5%). Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, may be associated with aging processes and with modulation of the risk of various pathologies, such as DM. Specifically, DNA methylation could be one of the mechanisms mediating the relation between DM and environmental exposures. Our goal was to identify new CpG methylation sites associated with DM. We performed a genome-wide methylation study in whole-blood DNA from an IS patient cohorts. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array was used to measure DNA methylation in CpG sites. All statistical analyses were adjusted for sex, age, hyperlipidemia, body mass index (BMI), smoking habit and cell count. Findings were replicated in two independent cohorts, an IS cohort and a population-based cohort, using the same array. In the discovery phase (N = 355), we identified a CpG site, cg19693031 (located in the TXNIP gene) that was associated with DM (P = 1.17 × 10(-12)); this CpG was replicated in two independent cohorts (N = 167 and N = 645). Methylation of TXNIP was inversely and intensely associated with HbA1c levels (P = 7.3 × 10(-16)), specifically related to diabetic patients with poor control of glucose levels. We identified an association between the TXNIP gene and DM through epigenetic mechanisms, related to sustained hyperglycemia levels (HbA1c ≥ 7%).",

Here we examine whether age-related epigenetic changes affect human islet function and if blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect these changes and associate with future T2D. We analyse DNA methylation genome-wide in islets from 87 non-diabetic donors, aged 26-74 years. Aging associates with increased DNA methylation of 241 sites. These sites cover loci previously associated with T2D, for example, KLF14. Blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related methylation changes in 83 genes identified in human islets (for example, KLF14, FHL2, ZNF518B and FAM123C) and some associate with insulin secretion and T2D. DNA methylation correlates with islet expression of multiple genes, including FHL2, ZNF518B, GNPNAT1 and HLTF. Silencing these genes in β-cells alter insulin secretion. Together, we demonstrate that blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related DNA methylation changes in human islets, and associate with insulin secretion in vivo and T2D.",
      "# Title: Genome-Wide DNA Methylation in Mixed Ancestry Individuals with Diabetes and Prediabetes from South Africa.\n# Abstract: Aims. To conduct a genome-wide DNA methylation in individuals with type 2 diabetes, individuals with prediabetes, and control mixed ancestry individuals from South Africa. Methods. We used peripheral blood to perform genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in 3 individuals with screen detected diabetes, 3 individuals with prediabetes, and 3 individuals with normoglycaemia from the Bellville South Community, Cape Town, South Africa, who were age-, gender-, body mass index-, and duration of residency-matched. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) was performed by Arraystar Inc. (Rockville, MD, USA). Results. Hypermethylated DMRs were 1160 (81.97%) and 124 (43.20%), respectively, in individuals with diabetes and prediabetes when both were compared to subjects with normoglycaemia. Our data shows that genes related to the immune system, signal transduction, glucose transport, and pancreas development have altered DNA methylation in subjects with prediabetes and diabetes. Pathway analysis based on the functional analysis mapping of genes to KEGG pathways suggested that the linoleic acid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism pathways are hypomethylated in prediabetes and diabetes. Conclusions. Our study suggests that epigenetic changes are likely to be an early process that occurs before the onset of overt diabetes. Detailed analysis of DMRs that shows gradual methylation differences from control versus prediabetes to prediabetes versus diabetes in a larger sample size is required to confirm these findings.",
      "# Title: Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing of Human Pancreatic Islets Reveals Novel Differentially Methylated Regions in Type 2 Diabetes Pathogenesis.\n# Abstract: Current knowledge about the role of epigenetics in type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains limited. Only a few studies have investigated DNA methylation of selected candidate genes or a very small fraction of genomic CpG sites in human pancreatic islets, the tissue of primary pathogenic importance for diabetes. Our aim was to characterize the whole-genome DNA methylation landscape in human pancreatic islets, to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in diabetic islets, and to investigate the function of DMRs in islet biology. Here, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, which is a comprehensive and unbiased method to study DNA methylation throughout the genome at a single nucleotide resolution, in pancreatic islets from donors with T2D and control subjects without diabetes. We identified 25,820 DMRs in islets from individuals with T2D. These DMRs cover loci with known islet function, e.g., PDX1, TCF7L2, and ADCY5 Importantly, binding sites previously identified by ChIP-seq for islet-specific transcription factors, enhancer regions, and different histone marks were enriched in the T2D-associated DMRs. We also identified 457 genes, including NR4A3, PARK2, PID1, SLC2A2, and SOCS2, that had both DMRs and significant expression changes in T2D islets. To mimic the situation in T2D islets, candidate genes were overexpressed or silenced in cultured β-cells. This resulted in impaired insulin secretion, thereby connecting differential methylation to islet dysfunction. We further explored the islet methylome and found a strong link between methylation levels and histone marks. Additionally, DNA methylation in different genomic regions and of different transcript types (i.e., protein coding, noncoding, and pseudogenes) was associated with islet expression levels. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the islet DNA methylome in individuals with and without diabetes and highlights the importance of epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets and T2D pathogenesis."

A total of 80 patients with acute cerebral infarction who were treated at our hospital were randomly selected. They were divided into groups A and B. The two groups were treated with intravenous thrombolysis, while group B received sub-hypothermia treatment. Prior to treatment and at 7 days after treatment, 5 ml of venous blood was collected and stored in a freezer at -80˚C. IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 levels were detected by ELISA and compared between the groups and time-points. The results were as follows: i) At 7 days after treatment, the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in group B were significantly decreased compared with those in group A (P<0.05), while there was no significant difference of these levels between group A and B before treatment (P>0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions in group A and group B was 35 and 20% respectively, and the mortality rate was 10 and 5%, respectively. There were no significant differences in adverse events and mortality between the two groups (P>0.05). In addition, a positive correlation of the level of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was determined in the patients prior to treatment. In conclusion, mild hypothermia treatment in addition to intravenous thrombolysis significantly reduced the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1 and MMP-2 in patients with acute cerebral infarction and reduced inflammation, and should therefore be incorporated in clinical practice.",

      "# Title: Comparisons of forward and backward gait between poorer and better attention capabilities in early Parkinson's disease.\n# Abstract: This study compared forward and backward gait between Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with poorer and better attention capabilities. PD and healthy control (HC) participants received a dual-stimuli attention task. The results were assessed using principal component analysis to quantify and rank attention capability. Accordingly, 22 PD and 42 HC subjects were equally divided into poorer (14 PD-P, 18 HC-P) and better (8 PD-B, 24 HC-B) attention capabilities. To analyze the spatiotemporal gait parameters, each participant walked forwards and backwards on a GAITRite(®) walkway. Compared to HC, PD performed worse in the dual task and exhibited slower velocity, less swing, and shorter stride in both walking directions. Notably, PD-P experienced all these gait defects, regardless of directions. PD-B walked worse than HC-B backwards, and displayed comparable gait to HC-P in both directions. In PD and HC, velocity, stride, and swing decreased perceptibly when walking backwards compared to forwards, and the same was true for velocity and stride in PD-P and PD-B. Backward strides were reduced evidently more in PD-P than in PD-B. However, backward swing reductions in PD-P and PD-B were statistically insignificant. Cadence in both directions was similar within the groups and between the groups, and there were little alterations between directions within each group and between groups. These results suggest that attention capability may affect PD gait. Poorer attention exacerbates gait defects and better attention improves gait in both directions. These results may support the application of cuing strategies in PD to enhance attention capability and improve walking gait.",
      "# Title: Investigation of factors impacting mobility and gait in Parkinson disease.\n# Abstract: Mobility and gait limitations are major issues for people with Parkinson disease (PD). Identification of factors that contribute to these impairments may inform treatment and intervention strategies. In this study we investigated factors that predict mobility and gait impairment in PD. Participants with mild to moderate PD and without dementia (n=114) were tested in one session 'off' medication. Mobility measures included the 6-Minute Walk test and Timed-Up-and-Go. Gait velocity was collected in four conditions: forward preferred speed, forward dual task, forward fast as possible and backward walking. The predictors analyzed were age, gender, disease severity, balance, balance confidence, fall history, self-reported physical activity, and executive function. Multiple regression models were used to assess the relationships between predictors and outcomes. The predictors, in different combinations for each outcome measure, explained 55.7% to 66.9% of variability for mobility and 39.5% to 52.8% for gait velocity. Balance was the most relevant factor (explaining up to 54.1% of variance in mobility and up to 45.6% in gait velocity). Balance confidence contributed to a lesser extent (2.0% to 8.2% of variance) in all models. Age explained a small percentage of variance in mobility and gait velocity (up to 2.9%). Executive function explained 3.0% of variance during forward walking only. The strong predictive relationships between balance deficits and mobility and gait impairment suggest targeting balance deficits may be particularly important for improving mobility and gait in people with PD, regardless of an individual's age, disease severity, fall history, or other demographic features."

      "# Title: Sexual and reproductive health of migrants: does the EU care?\n# Abstract: The European Union (EU) refers to health as a human right in many internal and external communications, policies and agreements, defending its universality. In parallel, specific health needs of migrants originating from outside the EU have been acknowledged. Yet, their right to health and in particular sexual and reproductive health (SRH) is currently not ensured throughout the EU. This paper reflects on the results of a comprehensive literature review on migrants' SRH in the EU applying the Critical Interpretive Synthesis review method. We highlight the discrepancy between a proclaimed rights-based approach to health and actual obstacles to migrants' attainment of good SRH. Uncertainties on entitlements of diverse migrant groups are fuelled by unclear legal provisions, creating significant barriers to access health systems in general and SRH services in particular. Furthermore, the rare strategies addressing migrants' health fail to address sexual health and are generally limited to perinatal care and HIV screening. Thus, future European public health policy-making should not only strongly encourage its Member States to ensure equal access to health care for migrants as for EU citizens, but also promote migrants' SRH effectively through a holistic and inclusive approach in SRH policies, prevention and care.",

Of 3155 papers retrieved, 31 met the inclusion criteria and are included in the review. A large number of barriers and facilitators to HIV testing were identified across the individual, social and structural levels. A number of study design and methodological issues, however, inhibited a comprehensive synthesis. There is no doubt that addressing HIV testing in migrants in high-income countries is complex; however, it has important implications for individual, community and population health, and a strong, empirically based response is warranted.",

      "# Title: Challenges in the provision of healthcare services for migrants: a systematic review through providers' lens.\n# Abstract: In recent years, cross-border migration has gained significant attention in high-level policy dialogues in numerous countries. While there exists some literature describing the health status of migrants, and exploring migrants' perceptions of service utilisation in receiving countries, there is still little evidence that examines the issue of health services for migrants through the lens of providers. This study therefore aims to systematically review the latest literature, which investigated perceptions and attitudes of healthcare providers in managing care for migrants, as well as examining the challenges and barriers faced in their practices.",
      "# Title: What the eye does not see: a critical interpretive synthesis of European Union policies addressing sexual violence in vulnerable migrants.\n# Abstract: In Europe, refugees, asylum seekers and undocumented migrants are more vulnerable to sexual victimisation than European citizens. They face more challenges when seeking care. This literature review examines how legal and policy frameworks at national, European and international levels condition the prevention of and response to sexual violence affecting these vulnerable migrant communities living in the European Union (EU). Applying the Critical Interpretive Synthesis method, we reviewed 187 legal and policy documents and 80 peer-reviewed articles on migrant sexual health for elements on sexual violence and further analysed the 37 legal and 12 peer-reviewed articles among them that specifically focused on sexual violence in vulnerable migrants in the EU-27 States. Legal and policy documents dealing with sexual violence, particularly but not exclusively in vulnerable migrants, apply 'tunnel vision'. They ignore: a) frequently occurring types of sexual violence, b) victimisation rates across genders and c) specific risk factors within the EU such as migrants' legal status, gender orientation and living conditions. The current EU policy-making paradigm relegates sexual violence in vulnerable migrants as an 'outsider' and 'female only' issue while EU migration and asylum policies reinforce its invisibility. Effective response must be guided by participatory rights- and evidence-based policies and a public health approach, acknowledging the occurrence and multiplicity of sexual victimisation of vulnerable migrants of all genders within EU borders.",
      "# Title: Human Trafficking in Ethiopia: A Scoping Review to Identify Gaps in Service Delivery, Research, and Policy.\n# Abstract: The purpose of this review is to integrate evidence on human trafficking in Ethiopia and identify gaps and recommendations for service delivery, research and training, and policy. A scoping literature review approach was used to systematically search nursing, medical, psychological, law, and international databases and synthesize information on a complex, understudied topic. The search yielded 826 articles, and 39 met the predetermined criteria for inclusion in the review. Trafficking in Ethiopia has occurred internally and externally in the form of adult and child labor and sex trafficking. There were also some reports of organ trafficking and other closely related human rights violations, such as child marriage, child soldiering, and exploitative intercountry adoption. Risk factors for trafficking included push factors (poverty, political instability, economic problems, and gender discrimination) and pull factors (demand for cheap labor). Trafficking was associated with poor health and economic outcomes for victims. Key recommendations for service delivery, research and training, and policy are identified, including establishing comprehensive services for survivor rehabilitation and reintegration, conducting quantitative health outcomes research, and reforming policy around migration and trafficking. Implementing the recommendations identified by this review will allow policy makers, researchers, and practitioners to take meaningful steps toward confronting human trafficking in Ethiopia.",

      "# Title: Factors Influencing the Accuracy of Infectious Disease Reporting in Migrants: A Scoping Review.\n# Abstract: We conducted a scoping review of literature to improve our understanding of the accuracy of infectious disease monitoring in migrants in the Europe. We searched PubMed for papers relevant to the topic including: case reports, observational and experimental studies, reviews, guidelines or policy documents; published after 1994. We identified 532 papers, 27 of which were included in the review. Legislation and right to access health care influence both the accuracy of rates and risk measures under estimating the at risk population, i.e., the denominator. Furthermore, the number of reported cases, i.e., the numerator, may also include cases not accounted for in the denominator. Both biases lead to an overestimated disease occurrence. Restriction to healthcare access and low responsiveness may cause under-detection of cases, however a quantification of this phenomenon has not been produced. On the contrary, screening for asymptomatic diseases increases ascertainment leading to increased detection of cases. Incompleteness of denominator data underestimates the at-risk population. In conclusion, most studies show a lower probability of under-reporting infectious diseases in migrants compared with native populations."

    "referenceConclusion": "Moderate level of evidence demonstrated that both R18 and R18D administration can significantly improve stroke outcomes in animal stroke models. However, considering the limitations, further pre‐clinical and clinical studies are warranted to substantiate the neuroprotective efficacy of polyarginines for stroke. The present study results showed promising effects regarding the efficacy of administering polyarginines of R18 and R18D in improving functional status and neurological outcomes and decreasing infarct size following the induction of stroke in rats. Moreover, R18 effectively reduced brain edema in animal models of stroke. All of the mentioned effects were supported by a moderate level of evidence. However, while these results are subjected to certain limitations, the pre‐clinical data are highly encouraging and provide the support for the translation of polyarginine peptides as possible clinical stroke therapeutics.",

      "# Title: Therapeutic effects of a reducible poly (oligo-D-arginine) carrier with the heme oxygenase-1 gene in the treatment of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.\n# Abstract: Non-viral carriers for gene therapy have been developed to minimize carrier cytotoxicity and to enhance transfection efficiency. Previously, we synthesized a 9-arginine-based reducible high molecular weight peptide for gene delivery. For the reducible poly(oligo-D-arginines) (rPOA), 9-arginine oligopeptides are connected by internal disulfide linkages to produce a high molecular weight peptide. In this study, rPOA was evaluated as a carrier of the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene for the treatment of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) -induced brain stroke. An in vitro transfection assay showed that rPOA had higher transfection efficiency and lower toxicity than polyethylenimine (PEI). For in vivo evaluation, I/R rat models were produced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). rPOA/HO-1 expression plasmid (pHO-1) polyplexes were injected into the brain at 1 h before MCAO, and HO-1 expression levels in the brain were then measured by ELISA. The results indicated that rPOA/pHO-1 polyplexes had higher transfection efficiencies than PEI/pHO-1 polyplexes. The rPOA/pHO-1 polyplexes significantly reduced infarct volumes. In addition, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) was reduced in the rPOA/pHO-1 polyplex injection group, suggesting that HO-1 had an anti-inflammatory effect, while the PEI/pHO-1 polyplex did not show this effect. These results suggest that rPOA is a potential non-viral vector for HO-1 gene therapy to protect brain cells from I/R-related neuronal injury including stroke.",
      "# Title: Poly-arginine and arginine-rich peptides are neuroprotective in stroke models.\n# Abstract: Using cortical neuronal cultures and glutamic acid excitotoxicity and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) stroke models, we demonstrated that poly-arginine and arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), are highly neuroprotective, with efficacy increasing with increasing arginine content, have the capacity to reduce glutamic acid-induced neuronal calcium influx and require heparan sulfate preotoglycan-mediated endocytosis to induce a neuroprotective effect. Furthermore, neuroprotection could be induced with immediate peptide treatment or treatment up to 2 to 4 hours before glutamic acid excitotoxicity or OGD, and with poly-arginine-9 (R9) when administered intravenously after stroke onset in a rat model. In contrast, the JNKI-1 peptide when fused to the (non-arginine) kFGF CPP, which does not rely on endocytosis for uptake, was not neuroprotective in the glutamic acid model; the kFGF peptide was also ineffective. Similarly, positively charged poly-lysine-10 (K10) and R9 fused to the negatively charged poly-glutamic acid-9 (E9) peptide (R9/E9) displayed minimal neuroprotection after excitotoxicity. These results indicate that peptide positive charge and arginine residues are critical for neuroprotection, and have led us to hypothesize that peptide-induced endocytic internalization of ion channels is a potential mechanism of action. The findings also question the mode of action of different neuroprotective peptides fused to arginine-rich CPPs.",

      "# Title: The R18 Polyarginine Peptide Is More Effective Than the TAT-NR2B9c (NA-1) Peptide When Administered 60 Minutes after Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in the Rat.\n# Abstract: We examined the dose responsiveness of polyarginine R18 (100, 300, and 1000 nmol/kg) when administered 60 minutes after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The TAT-NR2B9c peptide, which is known to be neuroprotective in rodent and nonhuman primate stroke models, served as a positive control. At 24 hours after MCAO, there was reduced total infarct volume in R18 treated animals at all doses, but this reduction only reached statistical significance at doses of 100 and 1000 nmol/kg. The TAT-NR2B9c peptide reduced infarct volume at doses of 300 and 1000 nmol/kg, but not to a statistically significant extent, while the 100 nmol/kg dose was ineffective. The reduction in infarct volume with R18 and TAT-NR2B9c peptide treatments was mirrored by improvements in one or more functional outcomes (namely, neurological score, adhesive tape removal, and rota-rod), but not to a statistically significant extent. These findings further confirm the neuroprotective properties of polyarginine peptides and for R18 extend its therapeutic time window and dose range, as well as demonstrating its greater efficacy compared to TAT-NR2B9c in a severe stroke model. The superior neuroprotective efficacy of R18 over TAT-NR2B9c highlights the potential of this polyarginine peptide as a lead candidate for studies in human stroke.",
      "# Title: Assessment of the Neuroprotective Effects of Arginine-Rich Protamine Peptides, Poly-Arginine Peptides (R12-Cyclic, R22) and Arginine-Tryptophan-Containing Peptides Following In Vitro Excitotoxicity and/or Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in Rats.\n# Abstract: We have demonstrated that arginine-rich and poly-arginine peptides possess potent neuroprotective properties with arginine content and peptide positive charge being particularly critical for neuroprotective efficacy. In addition, the presence of other amino acids within arginine-rich peptides, as well as chemical modifications, peptide length and cell-penetrating properties also influence the level of neuroprotection. Against this background, we have examined the neuroprotective efficacy of arginine-rich protamine peptides, a cyclic (R12-c) poly-arginine peptide and a R22 poly-arginine peptide, as well as arginine peptides containing tryptophan or other amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, glycine or leucine) in in vitro glutamic acid excitotoxicity and in vivo rat permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion models of stroke. In vitro studies demonstrated that protamine and poly-arginine peptides (R12-c, R22) were neuroprotective. Arginine-tryptophan-containing peptides were highly neuroprotective, with R12W8a being the most potent arginine-rich peptide identified in our laboratory. Peptides containing phenylalanine or tyrosine substituted in place of tryptophan in R12W8a were also highly neuroprotective, whereas leucine, and in particular glycine substitutions, decreased peptide efficacy. In vivo studies with protamine administered intravenously at 1000 nmol/kg 30 min after MCAO significantly reduced infarct volume and cerebral oedema by 22.5 and 38.6%, respectively. The R12W8a peptide was highly toxic when administered intravenously at 300 or 100 nmol/kg and ineffective at reducing infarct volume when administered at 30 nmol/kg 30 min after MCAO, unlike R18 (30 nmol/kg), which significantly reduced infarct volume by 20.4%. However, both R12W8a and R18 significantly reduced cerebral oedema by 19.8 and 42.2%, respectively. Protamine, R12W8a and R18 also reduced neuronal glutamic acid-induced calcium influx. These findings further highlight the neuroprotective properties of arginine-rich peptides and support the view that they represent a new class of neuroprotective agent.",
      "# Title: Delayed 2-h post-stroke administration of R18 and NA-1 (TAT-NR2B9c) peptides after permanent and/or transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat.\n# Abstract: Following positive results with the poly-arginine peptide R18 when administered intravenously 30 or 60min after permanent and/or transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO; 90min) in the rat, we examined the effectiveness of the peptide when administered 2h after MCAO. R18 was administered intravenously (1000nmol/kg via jugular vein) after permanent MCAO or a transient 3-h MCAO or when administered intra-arterially (100nmol/kg via internal carotid artery) immediately after reperfusion following a transient 2-h MCAO. In the transient MCAO studies, the neuroprotective NA-1 peptide was used as a positive control. Infarct volume, cerebral edema and functional outcomes were measured 24h after MCAO. Following permanent or transient MCAO, neither R18 nor NA-1 significantly reduced infarct volume. However, following permanent MCAO, R18 appeared to reduce cerebral edema (p=0.006), whereas following a transient 3-h MCAO, R18 improved the time to remove adhesive tape (p=0.04) without significantly affecting cerebral edema. There was also a trend (p=0.07) towards improved rota-rod performance with R18 in both permanent and transient 3-h MCAO. Following a transient 2-h MCAO, R18 had no significant effects on cerebral edema or neurological score but did lessen the extent of weight loss. Overall, while R18 had no effect on infarct volume, the peptide reduced cerebral edema after permanent MCAO, and improved some functional outcomes after transient MCAO.",
      "# Title: Warburg effect hypothesis in autism Spectrum disorders.\n# Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disease which is characterized by a deficit in social interactions and communication with repetitive and restrictive behavior. In altered cells, metabolic enzymes are modified by the dysregulation of the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway. In ASD, the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway is upregulated. We focus this review on the hypothesis of Warburg effect stimulated by the overexpression of the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway in ASD. Upregulation of WNT/β-catenin pathway induces aerobic glycolysis, named Warburg effect, through activation of glucose transporter (Glut), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1(PDK1), monocarboxylate lactate transporter 1 (MCT-1), lactate dehydrogenase kinase-A (LDH-A) and inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH). The aerobic glycolysis consists to a supply of a large part of glucose into lactate regardless of oxygen. Aerobic glycolysis is less efficient in terms of ATP production than oxidative phosphorylation because of the shunt of the TCA cycle. Dysregulation of energetic metabolism might promote cell deregulation and progression of ASD. Warburg effect regulation could be an attractive target for developing therapeutic interventions in ASD.",
      "# Title: Comparison of neuroprotective efficacy of poly-arginine R18 and R18D (D-enantiomer) peptides following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in the Wistar rat and in vitro toxicity studies.\n# Abstract: We have previously demonstrated that arginine-rich and poly-arginine peptides possess potent neuroprotective properties, with poly-arginine peptide R18 identified as being highly effective at reducing infarct volume following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the Sprague Dawley rat. Since peptides synthesised using D-isoform amino acids have greater stability than L-isoform peptides due to increased resistance to proteolytic degradation, they represent potentially more effective peptide therapeutics. Therefore we compared the neuroprotective efficacy of R18 and its D-enantiomer R18D following permanent MCAO in the Wistar rat. Furthermore, as increased peptide stability may also increase peptide toxicity, we examined the effects of R18 and R18D on cultured cortical neurons, astrocytes, brain endothelial cells (bEND.3), and embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) following a 10-minute or 24-hour peptide exposure duration. The in vivo studies demonstrated that R18D resulted in a greater reduction in mean infarct volume compared to R18 (33%, p = 0.004 vs 12%, p = 0.27) after intravenous administration at 300 nmol/kg 30 minutes after MCAO. Both R18D and R18 reduced cerebral hemisphere swelling to a comparable degree (27%, p = 0.03 and 30%, p = 0.02), and improved neurological assessment scores (1.5, p = 0.02 and 2, p = 0.058 vs 3 for vehicle). No abnormal histological findings specific to peptide treatments were observed in hematoxylin and eosin stained sections of kidney, liver, spleen, lung and heart. In vitro studies demonstrated that R18 and R18D were most toxic to neurons, followed by astrocytes, HEK293 and bEND.3 cells, but only at high concentrations and/or following 24-hour exposure. These findings further highlight the neuroprotective properties of poly-arginine peptides, and indicate that R18D at the dose examined is more potent than R18 in Wistar rats, and justify continued investigation of the R18 peptide as a novel neuroprotective agent for stroke.",
      "# Title: Assessment of therapeutic window for poly-arginine-18D (R18D) in a P7 rat model of perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy.\n# Abstract: Hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) remains the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in neonates, with no available neuroprotective therapeutic agent. In the development of a therapeutic for HIE, we examined the neuroprotective efficacy of the poly-arginine peptide R18D (arginine 18 mer synthesised with D-arginine) in a perinatal model of hypoxia-ischaemia (HI; common carotid and external carotid occlusion + 8%O2 /92%N2 for 2.5 hr) in the P7 Sprague-Dawley rat. R18D was administered intraperitoneally 30 min (doses 10, 30, 100, 300 and 1,000 nmol/kg), 60 min (doses 30 and 300 nmol/kg) or 120 min (doses 30 and 300 nmol/kg) after HI. Infarct volumes and behavioural outcomes were measured 48 hr after HI. When administered 30 min after HI, R18D at varying doses reduced infarct volume by 23.7% to 35.6% (p = 0.009 to < 0.0001) and resulted in improvements in the negative geotactic response and wire-hang times, at a dose of 30 nmol/kg. When administered 60 min after HI, R18D at the 30 nmol/kg dose reduced total infarct volume by 34.2% (p = 0.002), whilst the 300 nmol/kg dose improved wire-hang time. When administered 120 min after HI, R18D at the 30 and 300 nmol/kg doses had no significant impact on infarct volume, but the 300 nmol/kg dose improved the negative geotactic response. This study further confirms the neuroprotective properties of poly-arginine peptides, demonstrating that R18D can reduce infarct volume and improve behavioural outcomes after HI if administered up to 60 min after HI and improve behavioural outcomes up to 2 hr after HI.",
      "# Title: Poly-Arginine Peptides R18 and R18D Improve Functional Outcomes After Endothelin-1-Induced Stroke in the Sprague Dawley Rat.\n# Abstract: We have previously demonstrated that R18 and its d-enantiomer, R18D, are neuroprotective at 24 hours following intraluminal filament occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) in the rat. This study examined R18 and R18D effectiveness in improving functional outcomes at up to 56 days poststroke following endothelin-1-induced MCAO. Peptides were administered intravenously at doses of 100, 300, or 1000 nmol/kg, 60 minutes after MCAO. Functional recovery poststroke was assessed using multiple forelimb placing tests and horizontal ladder test, and NA-1 (TAT-NR2B9c), a neuroprotective currently in phase 3 clinical stroke trials, was used as a benchmark. The study demonstrated that R18 (300 and 1000 nmol/kg) was the most effective peptide in improving functional outcomes, followed by R18D (300 and 1000 nmol/kg), and NA-1 (300 and 100 nmol/kg). Furthermore, R18 at doses of 300 and 1000 nmol/kg was the most effective agent in restoring pre-stroke body weight, while R18 and R18D at doses of 300 and 1000 nmol/kg, but not NA-1 also significantly reduced the number of animals requiring hand feeding 48 hours after stroke. This study confirms that R18 and R18D are effective in improving long-term functional outcomes after stroke, and suggests that R18 may be more effective than NA-1.",
      "# Title: Comparative Assessment of the Proteolytic Stability and Impact of Poly-Arginine Peptides R18 and R18D on Infarct Growth and Penumbral Tissue Preservation Following Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in the Sprague Dawley Rat.\n# Abstract: Poly-arginine peptides R18 and R18D have previously been demonstrated to be neuroprotective in ischaemic stroke models. Here we examined the proteolytic stability and efficacy of R18 and R18D in reducing infarct core growth and preserving the ischaemic penumbra following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the Sprague Dawley rat. R18 (300 or 1000 nmol/kg), R18D (300 nmol/kg) or saline were administered intravenously 10 min after MCAO induced using a filament. Serial perfusion and diffusion-weighted MRI imaging was performed to measure changes in the infarct core and penumbra from time points between 45- and 225-min post-occlusion. Repeated measures analyses of infarct growth and penumbral tissue size were evaluated using generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs). R18D (300 nmol/kg) was most effective in slowing infarct core growth (46.8 mm3 reduction; p < 0.001) and preserving penumbral tissue (21.6% increase; p < 0.001), followed by R18 at the 300 nmol/kg dose (core: 29.5 mm3 reduction; p < 0.001, penumbra: 12.5% increase; p < 0.001). R18 at the 1000 nmol/kg dose had a significant impact in slowing core growth (19.5 mm3 reduction; p = 0.026), but only a modest impact on penumbral preservation (6.9% increase; p = 0.062). The in vitro anti-excitotoxic neuroprotective efficacy of R18D was also demonstrated to be unaffected when preincubated for 1-3 h or overnight, in a cell lysate prepared from dying neurons or with the proteolytic enzyme, plasmin, whereas the neuroprotective efficacy of R18 was significantly reduced after a 2-h incubation. These findings highlight the capacity of poly-arginine peptides to reduce infarct growth and preserve the ischaemic penumbra, and confirm the superior efficacy and proteolytic stability of R18D, which indicates that this peptide is likely to retain its neuroprotective properties when co-administered with alteplase during thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke."

The objective of our study was to evaluate the prognostic role of baseline NLR and change in NLR (ΔNLR) in advanced pancreatic cancer underwent chemotherapy. Between January 2010 and June 2015, 132 patients underwent chemotherapy were eligible for assessment. Based on our patients' data, the cut-off value of NLR was 2.78 according to receiver operating characteristic curve. We observed that a high level of baseline NLR (NLR > 2.78) was a poor prognostic factor for overall survival (multivariable hazard ratio [HR] = 2.648, P < 0.001). Increased NLR (ΔNLR > 0) after 2 cycles of chemotherapy was associated with higher risk compared to ΔNLR ≤ 0 (multivariable HR = 1.894, P = 0.007). Combining both NLR and ΔNLR factors, multivariate analysis showed a significant higher risk (HR = 5.817, P < 0.001) for patients with high baseline NLR and increased NLR after 2 cycles of chemotherapy compared to patients with low baseline NLR and ΔNLR ≤ 0.

    "referenceConclusion": "Increased frailty was associated with increased odds of any Clavien–Dindo 1-4 complication. Frailty measurements may be used as an integral component of risk-assessment strategies to improve the quality and value of neurosurgical care for patients undergoing craniotomy surgery. These findings suggest that preoperative frailty assessments could assist in risk-stratifying patients undergoing open cranial surgery. Increased odds of complications in frail patients can assist decision-makers in perioperative pathway planning and with informed consent. Increased odds of complications were a statistically robust outcome across a number of subgroups and sensitivity analyses.",

      "# Title: The modified frailty index and 30-day adverse events in oncologic neurosurgery.\n# Abstract: The modified frailty index (mFI) is emerging as a leading measure for preoperative risk assessment using routinely available medical record data. Our objective was to determine if mFI predicts morbidity and mortality in the diverse national cohort of patients undergoing neurosurgery for intracranial neoplasms. We identified patients in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program who underwent oncologic neurosurgery procedures between 2008 and 2012. The mFI, ranging from 0 to 1, was calculated as the proportion of 11 possible risk factors present. We assessed the associations between mFI and 30-day mortality, neurologic and medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge in univariate and multivariable analyses and compare the index to established risk stratification techniques. A total of 9149 patients were identified. Mortality, severe medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge increased incrementally with increasing levels of frailty. Severe neurologic complications were highest in those with low frailty. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, increased frailty increased the odds of all adverse outcomes, including neurologic complications. The mFI increased the ability to predict all outcomes beyond available indices and was the most reliable predictor of neurologic complications. The mFI can be calculated from routinely collected medical record data and is predictive of 30-day adverse outcomes in a wide variety of neurosurgical oncology patients. The index may be a useful component of preoperative risk assessment with implications for shared decision-making, perioperative planning, and risk adjusted outcomes measurement in national quality registries.",

When assessing quality of life for patients with brain tumors, having a better predictor of postsurgical outcome would be beneficial in counseling these patients. Frailty is thought to estimate physiologic reserves, and it has been found to predict postoperative complications, length of stay, and discharge to a skilled nursing facility or assisted living facility in patients undergoing various types of surgery. Frailty as an adjunct to preoperative assessment of neurosurgical patients has never been evaluated. This study aimed to determine whether frailty predicts neurosurgical complications in patients with brain tumors and enhances current perioperative risk models.",

      "# Title: Frailty and outcomes after craniotomy for brain tumor.\n# Abstract: Frailty has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in a variety of surgical disciplines. Few data exist regarding the relationship of frailty with adverse outcomes in craniotomy for brain tumor resection. We assessed the relationship between frailty and the incidence of major post-operative complication, discharge destination other than home, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality after elective craniotomy for brain tumor resection. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 20,333 adult patients undergoing elective craniotomy for tumor resection in the 2012-2018 ACS-NSQIP Participant Use File. Multivariate logistic regression was performed using all covariates deemed eligible through clinical and statistical significance. 6,249 patients (30.7%) were low-frailty and 2,148 patients (10.6%) were medium-to-high frailty. In multivariate logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, BMI, ASA classification, smoking status, dyspnea, significant pre-operative weight loss, chronic steroid use, bleeding disorder, tumor type, and operative time, low frailty was associated with increased adjusted odds ratio of major complication (1.41, 95% CI: 1.23-1.60, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.32, 95% CI: 1.20-1.46, p < 0.001), 30-day readmission (1.29, 95% CI: 1.15-1.44, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (1.87, 95% CI: 1.41-2.47, p < 0.001). Moderate-to-high frailty was also associated with increased adjusted odds of major complication (1.61, 95% CI: 1.35-1.92, p < 0.001), discharge destination other than home (1.80, 95% CI: 1.58-2.05), 30-day readmission (1.39, 95% CI: 1.19-1.62, p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (2.42, 95% CI: 1.74-3.38, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is associated with increased odds of major post-operative complication, discharge to destination other than home, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality.",

A randomized, single-blind study was performed to evaluate the effects of the combination of high-dose furosemide and small-volume hypertonic saline solution (HSS) infusion in the treatment of refractory New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV CHF and a normosodic diet during follow-up. Materials and Methods One hundred seven patients (39 women and 68 men, age range 65-90 years) with refractory CHF (NYHA class IV) of different etiologies, who were unresponsive to high oral doses of furosemide, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digitalis, and nitrates, were enrolled. Inclusion criteria included an ejection fraction (EF) <35%, serum creatinine level <2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level < or =60 mg/dL, reduced urinary volume, and low natriuresis. The patients were randomized in 2 groups (single-blind). Patients in group 1 (20 women and 33 men) received an intravenous (IV) infusion of furosemide (500-1000 mg) plus HSS (150 mL of 1.4%-4.6% NACl) twice a day in 30 minutes. Patients in group 2 (19 women and 35 men) received an IV bolus of furosemide (500-1000 mg) twice a day, without HSS, during a period lasting 6 to 12 days. Both groups received IV KCl (20-40 mEq) to prevent hypokalemia. At study entry, all patients underwent a physical examination and measurement of body weight (BW), blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR), an evaluation of signs of CHF, and measurement of control levels of serum Na, K, Cl, bicarbonate, albumin, uric acid, creatinine, urea, and glycemia daily during hospitalization, and measurements of the daily output of urine for Na, K, and Cl. A chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram were obtained at study entry, during hospitalization, and at the time of discharge from the hospital. During the treatment and after discharge, the daily dietary Na intake was 120 mmol in group 1 versus 80 mmol in group 2, with a fluid intake of 1000 mL daily in both groups. An assessment of BW and 24-hour urinary volume, serum, and urinary laboratory parameters were performed daily until patients reached a compensated state, when IV furosemide was replaced with oral administration (250-500 mg/d). After discharge from the hospital, patients were observed as outpatients weekly for the first 3 months and, subsequently, once a month.",

Both groups had normal sodium (120 mmol sodium) intake. After discharge, the two groups continued to receive 120 mmol Na/day and 500-1000 mL water/day.The first group (132 C-HSS patients) had an increase in urination, a reduction in hospitalization time (4 ± 2 versus 7 ± 2 days, P < 0.01), and a reduction in hospitalization costs (2210 RMB versus 3506 RMB, P < 0.01) compared with the second group (132 without C-HSS patients). During the follow-up period (36 ± 12 months), the first group had a significantly higher average readmission time (31.84 ± 7.58 months versus 15.60 ± 6.25 months, P < 0.01) and lower mortality rate (16.5% versus 31.9%, P < 0.01).The results suggest that periodical C-HSS administration, combined with serious water restriction and a normal sodium diet, significantly reduces the hospitalization time, readmission rate, and mortality in patients with NYHA class III HF."

This study analyzes the trend of malnutrition prevalence rates between 2007 and 2011 in the long-term care sector, and the related effects of(1) process indicators such as nutritional screening and treatment and 2) structural indicators (guideline, protocol or nutritional screening policy). From 2007 to 2011, the Dutch National Prevalence Measurement of Care Problems (LPZ) was performed in Dutch long-term care organizations using a standardized questionnaire involving measurements at institutional, ward and resident level. The data were analyzed by mixed-linear regression for longitudinal data. Presence of malnutrition was assessed by BMI, undesired weight loss and nutritional intake. Seventy-four care homes were included (26,101 residents). The malnutrition prevalence trend significantly decreased (P < 0.001) from 26% to 18% from 2007 to 2011. In the final model of the mixed effects analysis only the interacted process indicators nutritional screening and oral nutritional supplementation (ONS) were significant in influencing malnutrition prevalence rates over time. Structural indicators had no impact on the malnutrition prevalence over time. In conclusion, over time a lower prevalence of malnutrition is associated with a higher degree of nutritional screening. As might be expected, a higher prevalence of malnutrition is associated with higher use of ONS. Structural nutritional screening is an important intervention to tackle the problem of malnutrition in the long term care sector.",

      "# Title: Which characteristics of nursing home residents influence differences in malnutrition prevalence? An international comparison of The Netherlands, Germany and Austria.\n# Abstract: Prevalence rates of malnutrition vary considerably internationally, partly due to differences in measurement methodology and instruments. In the present study, the same measurement methodology and instruments were used in The Netherlands, Germany and Austria. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether resident characteristics influence possible differences in malnutrition prevalence between countries. The study followed a cross-sectional, multi-centre design that measured malnutrition in nursing home residents from The Netherlands, Germany and Austria. Resident data were gathered using a standardised questionnaire. Malnutrition was operationalised using BMI, unintentional weight loss and nutritional intake. Data were analysed using an association model. The prevalence rates of malnutrition in The Netherlands, Germany and Austria were 18·3, 20·1 and 22·5 %, respectively. The multivariate generalised estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression analysis showed that sex, age, care dependency, the mean number of diseases and some specific diseases were influencing factors for whether the resident was malnourished or not. The OR of malnutrition in the three countries declined after including the influencing factors resulting from the multivariate GEE analysis. The present study reveals that differences in the prevalence rates of malnutrition in nursing homes in The Netherlands, Germany and Austria are influenced by different resident characteristics. Since other country-related factors could also play an important role in influencing differences in the prevalence rates of malnutrition between the countries (structural and process factors of malnutrition care policy).

      "# Title: Expression of a hepatitis A virus antigen in Lactococcus lactis and Escherichia coli and evaluation of its immunogenicity.\n# Abstract: An epidemic shift in Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection has been observed in recent years in rapidly developing countries, with increasing numbers of severe adult cases which has led to renewed interest in vaccination. Our approach in vaccine development uses recombinant expression of the highly immunogenic HAV antigen VP1-P2a in food-grade lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis and in Escherichia coli. We used genetic constructs that enable nisin-controlled expression of the antigen in L. lactis in three different forms: (a) intracellularly, (b) on the bacterial surface and (c) on the bacterial surface fused with the fragment of the E. coli flagellin molecule that can act as a molecular adjuvant. Expression of the two surface forms of the antigen was achieved in L. lactis, and the resulting antigen-displaying bacteria were administered orally to mice. Half the animals in each of the two groups developed specific IgGs, with titers increasing over time and reaching 1:422 without flagellin and 1:320 with flagellin. A much higher titer 1:25,803 was observed with the parenterally administered antigen, which was purified from E. coli. With the latter, a significant mucosal IgA response was also observed. Despite significant titers, the IgGs elicited with oral or parenteral administration could not prevent HAV from infecting cells in a virus neutralization assay, suggesting that the antibodies cannot recognize viral surface epitopes. Nevertheless, orally administered HAV antigen expressed in L. lactis elicited significant systemic humoral immune response showing the feasibility for development of effective HAV vaccine for mucosal delivery.",
      "# Title: Oral immunization with recombinant Lactococcus lactis delivering a multi-epitope antigen CTB-UE attenuates Helicobacter pylori infection in mice.\n# Abstract: Urease is an essential virulence factor and colonization factor for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and is considered as an excellent vaccine candidate antigen. However, conventional technologies for preparing an injectable vaccine require purification of the antigenic protein and preparation of an adjuvant. Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 (L. lactis) could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of edible vaccine. In previous study, we constructed a multi-epitope vaccine, designated CTB-UE, which is composed of the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), three Th cell epitopes and two B-cell epitopes from urease subunits. To develop a novel type of oral vaccine against H. pylori, genetically modified L. lactis strains were established to secrete this epitope vaccine extracellularly in this study. Oral prophylactic immunization with recombinant L. lactis significantly elicited humoral anti-urease antibody responses (P < 0.001) and reduced the gastric colonization of H. pylori from 7.14 ± 0.95 to 4.68 ± 0.98 log10 CFU g(-1) stomach. This L. lactis oral vaccine offers a promising vaccine candidate for the control of H. pylori infection.",
      "# Title: Development of a new DNA vaccine based on mycobacterial ESAT-6 antigen delivered by recombinant invasive Lactococcus lactis FnBPA+.\n# Abstract: The use of the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis as a vehicle for the oral delivery of DNA vaccine plasmids constitutes a promising strategy for vaccination. The delivery of DNA plasmids into eukaryotic cells is of critical importance for subsequent DNA expression and effectiveness of the vaccine. In this context, the use of the recombinant invasive L. lactis FnBPA+ (fibronectin-binding protein A) strain for the oral delivery of the eukaryotic expression vector vaccination using lactic acid bacteria (pValac), coding for the 6-kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6) gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, could represent a new DNA vaccine strategy against tuberculosis. To this end, the ESAT-6 sequence was cloned into the pValac vector; the L. lactis fibronectin-binding protein A (FnBPA)+ (pValac:ESAT-6) strain was obtained, and its immunological profile was checked in BALB/c mice. This strain was able to significantly increase interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production in spleen cells, showing a systemic T helper 1 (Th1) cell response. The mice also showed a significant increase in specific secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) production in colon tissue and fecal extracts. Thus, this is the first time that L. lactis has been used to deliver a plasmid DNA harboring a gene that encodes an antigen against tuberculosis through mucous membranes.",
      "# Title: Lactococcus lactis displayed neuraminidase confers cross protective immunity against influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Influenza A viruses pose a serious threat to public health. Current influenza A vaccines predominantly focus on hemagglutinin (HA) and show strain-specific protection. Neuraminidase (NA) is much less studied in the context of humoral immunity against influenza A viruses. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cross protective immunity of NA presented on Lactococcus lactis (L.lactis) surface against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in the mouse model. L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA was constructed in which pgsA was used as an anchor protein. Mice vaccinated orally with L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA could elicit significant NA-specific serum IgG and mucosa IgA antibodies, as well as neuraminidase inhibition (NI) titers. Importantly, L.lactis/pNZ8110-pgsA-NA provided 80% protection against H5N1, 60% protection against H3N2 and H1N1, respectively. These findings suggest that recombinant L.lactis/pNZ110-pgsA-NA in the absence of adjuvant via oral administration can be served as an effective vaccine candidate against diverse strains of influenza A viruses.",
      "# Title: Broadly protective immunity against divergent influenza viruses by oral co-administration of Lactococcus lactis expressing nucleoprotein adjuvanted with cholera toxin B subunit in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines need to be annually reformulated to well match the predicated circulating strains. Thus, it is critical for developing a novel universal influenza vaccine that would be able to confer cross-protection against constantly emerging divergent influenza virus strains. Influenza virus A is a genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses. Influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) is a structural protein which encapsidates the negative strand viral RNA, and anti-NP antibodies play role in cross-protective immunity. Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) is an ideal vaccine delivery vehicle via oral administration route. However, L. lactis vectored vaccine exhibits poor immunogenicity without the use of mucosal adjuvant. To enhance the immunogenicity of L. lactis vectored vaccine, cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit, one of mucosal adjuvants, is a safe adjuvant for oral route, when combined with L. lactis vectored vaccine. In this study, we hypothesized that pNZ8008, a L. lactis expression plasmid, encoding NP antigen, would be able to elicit cross-protection with the use of CTB via oral administration route.",
      "# Title: Cross-protection of Lactococcus lactis-displayed HA2 subunit against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses in mice.\n# Abstract: Current influenza vaccines provide strain-specific protection against homologous subtypes and need to be updated annually. Therefore, it is essential to develop a universal vaccine that would induce broadly cross-protective immunity against homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses. The highly conserved HA2 subunit is a promising candidate for developing a universal influenza vaccine. Here, we hypothesized that the HA2 subunit could be displayed on the surface of Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis), using Spax as an anchor protein (L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2) and that L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 would have immunogenicity by oral administration without the use of adjuvant in the mouse model. To address this hypothesis, we show that oral vaccination of mice with L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 elicited significant humoral and mucosal immune responses. Importantly, L. lactis/pNZ8008-Spax-HA2 provided 100% protection against homologous H5N1 or heterologous H1N1 virus challenge. These results suggest that an HA2 subunit presented on the surface of L. lactis is an effective universal vaccine candidate against influenza A viruses in the poultry industry and in humans.",
      "# Title: Oral Immunization with a Recombinant Lactococcus lactis-Expressing HIV-1 Antigen on Group A Streptococcus Pilus Induces Strong Mucosal Immunity in the Gut.\n# Abstract: The induction of a potent humoral and cellular immune response in mucosal tissue is important for the development of an effective HIV vaccine. Most of the current HIV vaccines under development use the i.m. route for immunization, which is relatively poor in generating potent and long-lived mucosal immune responses. In this article, we explore the ability of an oral vaccination with a probiotic organism, Lactococcus lactis, to elicit HIV-specific immune responses in the mucosal and systemic compartments of BALB/c mice. We expressed the HIV-1 Gag-p24 on the tip of the T3 pilus of Streptococcus pyogenes as a fusion to the Cpa protein (LL-Gag). After four monthly LL-Gag oral immunizations, we observed strong Gag-specific IgG and IgA responses in serum, feces, and vaginal secretions. However, the Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses in the blood were at or below our detection limit. After an i.m. modified vaccinia Ankara/Gag boost, we observed robust Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses both in systemic and in mucosal tissues, including intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes of the small intestine, Peyer's patches, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Consistent with strong immunogenicity, the LL-Gag induced activation of CD11c(+) CD11b(+) dendritic cells in the Peyer's patches after oral immunization. Our results demonstrate that oral immunization with L. lactis expressing an Ag on the tip of the group A Streptococcus pilus serves as an excellent vaccine platform to induce strong mucosal humoral and cellular immunity against HIV.",
      "# Title: An engineered Lactococcus lactis strain exerts significant immune responses through efficient expression and delivery of Helicobacter pylori Lpp20 antigen.\n# Abstract: To produce and deliver Helicobacter pylori lipoprotein Lpp20 via using Lactococcus lactis with aim of developing an efficient way to use this protective antigen in vaccine formulation.",
      "# Title: Production and delivery of Helicobacter pylori NapA in Lactococcus lactis and its protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity.\n# Abstract: Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein A subunit (NapA) has been identified as a virulence factor, a protective antigen and a potent immunomodulator. NapA shows unique application potentials for anti-H. pylori vaccines and treatment strategies of certain allergic diseases and carcinomas. However, appropriate production and utilization modes of NapA still remain uncertain to date. This work has established a novel efficient production and utilization mode of NapA by using L. lactis as an expression host and delivery vector, and demonstrated immune protective efficacy and immune modulatory activity of the engineered L. lactis by oral vaccination of mice. It was observed for the first time that H. pylori NapA promotes both polarized Th17 and Th1 responses, which may greatly affect the clinical application of NapA. This report offers a promising anti-H. pylori oral vaccine candidate and a potent mucosal immune modulatory agent. Meanwhile, it uncovers a way to produce and deliver the oral vaccine and immunomodulator by fermentation of food like milk, which might have striking effects on control of H. pylori infection, gastrointestinal cancers, and Th2 bias allergic diseases, including many food allergies.",
      "# Title: Protective immunity induced by an intranasal multivalent vaccine comprising 10 Lactococcus lactis strains expressing highly prevalent M-protein antigens derived from Group A Streptococcus.\n# Abstract: Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) causes diseases ranging from mild pharyngitis to severe invasive infections. The N-terminal fragment of streptococcal M protein elicits protective antibodies and is an attractive vaccine target. However, this N- terminal fragment is hypervariable: there are more than 200 different M types. In this study, an intranasal live bacterial vaccine comprising 10 strains of Lactococcus lactis, each expressing one N-terminal fragment of M protein, has been developed. Live bacterial-vectored vaccines cost less to manufacture because the processes involved are less complex than those required for production of protein subunit vaccines. Moreover, intranasal administration does not require syringes or specialized personnel. Evaluation of individual vaccine types (M1, M2, M3, M4, M6, M9, M12, M22, M28 and M77) showed that most of them protected mice against challenge with virulent S. pyogenes. All 10 strains combined in a 10-valent vaccine (M×10) induced serum and bronchoalveolar lavage IgG titers that ranged from three- to 10-fold those of unimmunized mice. After intranasal challenge with M28 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice was significantly higher than that of unimmunized mice. In contrast, when mice were challenged with M75 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice did not differ significantly from that of unimmunized mice. Mx-10 immunized mice had significantly less S. pyogenes in oropharyngeal washes and developed less severe disease symptoms after challenge than did unimmunized mice. Our L. lactis-based vaccine may provide an alternative solution to development of broadly protective group A streptococcal vaccines.",
      "# Title: Mucosal and systemic immune responses elicited by recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a fusion protein composed of pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin from Bordetella pertussis.\n# Abstract: We constructed a food-grade expression system harboring a F1S1 fusion protein of Bordetella pertussis to be produced in Lactococcus lactis NZ3900 as a new oral vaccine model against whooping cough, caused by B. pertussis. F1S1 was composed of N-terminally truncated S1 subunit of pertussis toxin and type I immunodominant domain of filamentous hemagglutinin which are both known as protective immunogens against pertussis. The recombinant L. lactis was administered via oral or intranasal routes to BALB/c mice and the related specific systemic and mucosal immune responses were then evaluated. The results indicated significantly higher levels of specific IgA in the lung extracts and IgG in sera of mucosally-immunized mice, compared to their controls. It was revealed that higher levels of IgG2a, compared to IgG1, were produced in all mucosally-immunized mice. Moreover, immunized mice developed Th1 responses with high levels of IFN-γ production by the spleen cells. These findings provide evidence for L. lactis to be used as a suitable vehicle for expression and delivery of F1S1 fusion protein to mucosa and induction of appropriate systemic and mucosal immune responses against pertussis.",
      "# Title: Rotavirus VP6 protein mucosally delivered by cell wall-derived particles from Lactococcus lactis induces protection against infection in a murine model.\n# Abstract: Rotaviruses are the primary cause of acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide. Although the implementation of live attenuated vaccines has reduced the number of rotavirus-associated deaths, variance in their effectiveness has been reported in different countries. This fact, among other concerns, leads to continuous efforts for the development of new generation of vaccines against rotavirus.In this work, we describe the obtention of cell wall-derived particles from a recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a cell wall-anchored version of the rotavirus VP6 protein. After confirming by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, flow cytometry and electronic immunomicroscopy that these particles were carrying the VP6 protein, their immunogenic potential was evaluated in adult BALB/c mice. For that, mucosal immunizations (oral or intranasal), with or without the dmLT [(double mutant Escherichia coli heat labile toxin LT(R192G/L211A)] adjuvant were performed. The results showed that these cell wall-derived particles were able to generate anti-rotavirus IgG and IgA antibodies only when administered intranasally, whether the adjuvant was present or not. However, the presence of dmLT was necessary to confer protection against rotavirus infection, which was evidenced by a 79.5 percent viral shedding reduction.In summary, this work describes the production of cell wall-derived particles which were able to induce a protective immune response after intranasal immunization. Further studies are needed to characterize the immune response elicited by these particles as well as to determine their potential as an alternative to the use of live L. lactis for mucosal antigen delivery.",
      "# Title: Extracellular overproduction of E7 oncoprotein of Iranian human papillomavirus type 16 by genetically engineered Lactococcus lactis.\n# Abstract: We aimed at constructing Lactococcus lactis strains expressing HPV-16 recombinant E7 (rE7) oncoprotein and examining its overproduction ability followed by optimizing batch and fed-batch fermentations. Thereafter, in order to assess the immunogenicity of recombinant L. lactis cells, C57BL/6 mice were immunized by oral gavage.",
      "# Title: A Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB)-Based Vaccine Candidate for Human Norovirus.\n# Abstract: Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are responsible for more than 95% of the non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis epidemics in the world. The CDC estimates that every year 21 million individuals suffer from HuNoV-induced gastroenteritis in the United States. Currently, there is no FDA-approved vaccine for HuNoVs. Development of an effective vaccine has been hampered by the lack of an efficient cell culture system for HuNoVs and a suitable small animal model for pathogenesis study. In this study, we developed lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as a vector to deliver HuNoV antigen. A LAB strain (Lactococcus lactis) carrying VP1 gene of a HuNoV GII.4 virus (LAB-VP1) was constructed. It was found that HuNoV VP1 protein was highly expressed by LAB vector and was secreted into media supernatants. To test whether LAB-based HuNoV vaccine candidate is immunogenic, 4-day-old gnotobiotic piglets were orally inoculated with various doses of LAB-VP1. It was found that LABs were persistent in the small intestine of piglets and shed in pig feces for at least 25 days post inoculation. LAB DNA and VP1 were detected in mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen tissue in LAB-VP1 inoculated groups. HuNoV-specific IgG and IgA were detectable in serum and feces respectively at day 13 post-inoculation, and further increased at later time points. After being challenged with HuNoV GII.4 strain, a large amount of HuNoV antigens were observed in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum sections of the intestine in the LAB control group. In contrast, significantly less, or no, HuNoV antigens were detected in the LAB-VP1 immunized groups. Collectively, these results demonstrate that a LAB-based HuNoV vaccine induces protective immunity in gnotobiotic piglets.",
      "# Title: Recombinant lactococcus lactis secreting viral protein 1 of enterovirus 71 and its immunogenicity in mice.\n# Abstract: To construct recombinant Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) expressing viral protein 1 (VP1) of enterovirus 71 (EV71) and evaluate its immunogenicity to be used as an oral vaccine in BALB/c mice.",
      "# Title: A food-grade engineered Lactococcus lactis strain delivering Helicobacter pylori Lpp20 alleviates bacterial infection in H. pylori-challenged mice.\n# Abstract: To construct a food-grade bacterium producing and delivering H. pylori Lpp20 antigen and evaluate its immune efficacy against H. pylori challenges with aim to develop anti-H. pylori oral vaccines and functional foods.",
      "# Title: Mucosal Vaccination with Lactococcus lactis-Secreting Surface Immunological Protein Induces Humoral and Cellular Immune Protection against Group B Streptococcus in a Murine Model.\n# Abstract: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the primary etiological agent of sepsis and meningitis in newborns and is associated with premature birth and stillbirth. The development of a licensed vaccine is one of the pending challenges for the World Health Organization. Previously, we showed that oral immunization with surface immune protein (SIP) decreases vaginal colonization of GBS and generates functional opsonizing antibodies, which was determined by opsonophagocytic assays (OPA) in vitro. We also showed that the protein has an adjuvant vaccine profile. Therefore, an oral vaccine based on SIP may be an attractive alternative to employ in the development of new vaccines against GBS. Lactococcus lactis is a highlighted oral vaccine probiotic inducer of the mucosal immune response. This bacterium could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of an edible vaccine and has been used in clinical trials. In this study, we showed that an oral vaccine with a recombinant L. lactis strain secreting SIP from GBS (rL. lactis-SIP) can induce protective humoral and cellular immunity in an experimental model of GBS vaginal colonization in C57BL/6 mice. Mice immunized with rL. lactis-SIP were protected against clinical symptoms and bacterial colonization after GBS vaginal colonization. Our rL. lactis-SIP vaccine also induces an increase of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) specifically against SIP. The adoptive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice to naïve mice generated protection against GBS vaginal colonization. Moreover, the rL. lactis-SIP strain induces the activation of SIP-specific T cells, which could decrease GBS vaginal colonization and generate protective antibodies when transferred to other mice. Our experimental observations strongly support the notion that rL. lactis-SIP induces protective humoral and cellular immunity and could be considered as a novel alternative in the development of vaccines for GBS.",
      "# Title: Recombinant Lactococcus Lactis Displaying Omp31 Antigen of Brucella melitensis Can Induce an Immunogenic Response in BALB/c Mice.\n# Abstract: Since Brucella infection mostly occurs through the mucosal surfaces, immune response induced by vaccine that is delivered by a way of mucosal route can be drastically enhanced to control the brucellosis. Omp31is the major outer membrane protein of Brucella, and is considered as a protective antigen against Brucella infection. Accordingly, Lactococcus lactis has been used as an antigen-delivering vector to develop a vaccine-induced mucosal response for having a safer vaccination against brucellosis. A designed omp31 gene fused to the usp45 signal peptide and M6 cell wall anchor was sub cloned in the pNZ7021 expression vector, and a recombinant L. lactis displaying Omp31 was constructed. Omp31 protein expression was confirmed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. Animals were orally and intraperitoneally immunized with live or killed L. lactis expressing Omp31, respectively. The humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated by measuring the specific cytokines and antibodies. sIgA, serum IgA, IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in the mice immunized with live recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31 and also serum IgM, and total IgG antibodies significantly increased in mice immunized with killed recombinant L. lactis expressing Omp31. Among IgG subtypes, IgG2a response was significantly higher in both groups compared to IgG1. In mice groups immunized with recombinant L. lactis, the IFN-γ and IL-10 level elevated; however, there was no change in the level of IL-4. These results indicated that recombinants L. lactis induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, and also vaccines based on L. lactis-derived live carriers are promising interventions against Brucella melitensis infections.",
      "# Title: Lactococcus lactis FNBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) Induces Cellular and Humoral Immune Responses After Oral Immunization of Mice.\n# Abstract: The development of a new vaccine strategy against tuberculosis is urgently needed and has been greatly encouraged by the scientific community worldwide. In this work, we constructed a lactococcal DNA vaccine based on the fusion of two Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens, ESAT-6 and Ag85A, and examined its immunogenicity. The coding sequences of the ESAT-6 and Ag85A genes were fused and cloned into the eukaryotic expression pValac vector, and the functionality of the vector was confirmed in vitro. Then, L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) was obtained and used for oral immunization of mice. This strain induced significant increases in IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-17 cytokines in stimulated splenocyte cultures, and significant production of antigen-specific sIgA was observed in the colonic tissues of immunized mice. We demonstrated that L. lactis FnBPA+ (pValac:e6ag85a) generated a cellular and humoral immune response after oral immunization of mice. The strategy developed in this work may represent an interesting DNA mucosal vaccine candidate against tuberculosis, using the fusion of two highly immunogenic antigens delivered by safe lactic acid bacteria.",
      "# Title: Protective Immunity Against Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli by Oral Vaccination of Engineered Lactococcus lactis.\n# Abstract: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the leading causes of diarrhea in children globally, and thus suitable vaccines are desired. Antigen display on lactic acid bacteria is a reliable approach for efficient oral vaccination and preventing bowel diseases. To develop an oral vaccine against ETEC, the gene of the binding domain from heat-labile toxin (LTB), a key ETEC virulence factor, was codon-optimized and cloned into a construct containing a signal peptide and an anchor for display on L. lactis. Bioinformatics analysis showed a codon adaptation index of 0.95 for the codon-optimized gene. Cell surface expression of LTB was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and blotting. White New Zealand rabbits were immunized per os (PO) with the recombinant L. lactis, and the antibody titers were assayed with ELISA. In vitro neutralization assay was performed using mouse adrenal tumor cells and rabbit ileal loop test was performed as the in vivo assay. ELISA results indicated that oral administration of the engineered L. lactis elicited a significant production of IgA in the intestine. In vitro neutralization assay showed that the effect of the toxin could be neutralized with 500 µg/ml of IgG isolated from the oral vaccine group. Furthermore, the dose of ETEC causing fluid accumulation in the ileal loop test showed a tenfold increase in rabbits immunized with either recombinant L. lactis or LTB protein compared to other groups. Our results imply that recombinant L. lactis could potentially be an effective live oral vaccine against ETEC toxicity.",
      "# Title: Oral Immunization of Mice with Cell Extracts from Recombinant Lactococcus lactis Expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein.\n# Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all over the world and became a pandemic that named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). At present, several intramuscular vaccines have been successfully developed and mass vaccination has progressed in many countries. The aim of the study is to develop and examine an oral vaccine against COVID-19 with recombinant Lactococcus lactis IL1403, a strain of lactic acid bacteria, expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) S1 subunit as an immunizing antigen. PBS or cell extracts from recombinant L. lactis were orally administered into mice (control VS treatment), and formation of antigen-specific antibodies and changes in the gut microbiome were analyzed. Intracellular antigen was detected, but its secretion was not successful. After immunization, antigen-specific serum IgG and fecal IgA levels were 1.5-fold (P = 0.002) and 1.4-fold (P = 0.016) higher in the immunized mice (treatment) than control, respectively. Gut microbiome profiles were clearly separated between the two groups when analyzed for beta diversity with overall similarity. At the genus level, while Coprococcus (P = 0.036) and unclassified genus of Ruminococcaceae (P = 0.037) in treatment were more abundant than control, rc4-4 (P = 0.013) and Stenotrophomonas (P = 0.021) were less abundant. Our results indicate that cell extract containing SARS-CoV-2 antigen can induce mice to produce antigen-specific antibodies without overall changes in the gut microbiome. This strategy may be useful for the development of other oral viral vaccines.",
      "# Title: Oral Immunization With a M Cell-Targeting Recombinant L. Lactis Vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE Stimulate Protective Immunity Against H. Pylori in Mice.\n# Abstract: There are many virulence factors of H. pylori that contribute in diverse ways to gastric disease. Therefore, designing multivalent epitope vaccines against many key virulence factors virulence factors of H. pylori is a promising strategy to control H. pylori infection. In previous studies, we constructed a multivalent epitope vaccine FVpE against four key virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), and oral immunization with the FVpE vaccine plus a polysaccharide adjuvant (PA) containing lycium barbarum polysaccharide and chitosan could provide protection against H. pylori infection in the Mongolian gerbil model. Oral vaccines have many advantages over injected vaccines, such as improved safety and compliance, and easier manufacturing and administration. However, the harsh gastrointestinal (GI) environment, such as gastric acid and proteolytic enzymes, limits the development of oral vaccines to some extent. Oral vaccines need a gastrointestinal delivery system with high safety, low price and promoting vaccine antigen to stimulate immune response in the gastrointestinal mucosa. Lactic acid bacteria are gastrointestinal probiotics that have unique advantages as a delivery system for oral vaccines. In this study, a M cell-targeting surface display system for L. lactis named plSAM was designed to help vaccine antigens to stimulate effective immune responses in the gastrointestinal tract, and a M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE was constructed by using the surface display system plSAM. recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE could secretively express the SAM-FVpE protein and display it on the bacterial surface. Moreover, experimental results confirmed that LL-plSAM-FVpE had an enhanced M cell-targeting property. In addition, LL-plSAM-FVpE had excellent M cell-targeting property to promote the phagocytosis and transport of the antigen SAM-FVpE by gastrointestinal M cells. More importantly, oral immunization of LL-plSAM-FVpE or SAM-FVpE plus PA can stimulate IgG and sIgA antibodies and CD4+ T cell immune responses against four virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), thus providing protective immunity against H. pylori infection in mice. The M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccine against various key H. pylori virulence factors could be a promising vaccine candidate for controlling H. pylori infection.",
      "# Title: Oral and intranasal immunization with food-grade recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing high conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein triggers mice's immunity responses.\n# Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic began at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread throughout the world. Vaccination is still the most effective method of prevention of pathogenic infections, including viral infections. However, there is little evidence that vaccination can protect against SARS-CoV-2 virus for a long time. Thus, regular re-vaccination is necessary to control COVID-19. Vaccination by injection is invasive, and is one of the reasons people refuse to get re-vaccinated. Therefore, we developed a less invasive vaccine based on oral or nasal administration. The gene encoding the high conserved region (HCR) spike protein was inserted into pNZ8149 and expressed in L.lactis NZ3900. Mice were immunized at 3-week intervals with oral or nasal routes. Anti-SARS-CoV2 spike antibody (IgG and IgA) level were measured using ELISA method before and after treatment. Plasma cells population in lymph were analyzed using flowcytometry and the CD4 + and CD8 + cells in lymph and intestine were analyzed using immunofluorescence method. The results of nasal and oral administration in experimental animals showed that L.lactis carrying the HCR gene could induce a humoral immune response, as indicated by increased levels of IgG and IgA against SARS-CoV-2 (IgG/IgA-SARS-CoV-2). The plasma cell population after nasal and oral vaccination in mice were significantly different with control group (p < 0.05). The CD4 + and CD8 + cells in intestine were significantly higher in orally immunized group mice than control group. The CD8 + cells in lymph were significantly higher in intranasal immunized group mice than control group. Our data demonstrate L.lactis expressing spike protein can be developed into a less invasive alternative to nasal and oral vaccination.",
      "# Title: Expanding strain coverage of a group A Streptococcus pilus-expressing Lactococcus lactis mucosal vaccine.\n# Abstract: Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a human pathogenic bacterium that can trigger a wide range of diseases, including the autoimmune diseases acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, causing major morbidity and mortality in many low- and middle-income countries. Primary intervention programs have had limited success thus far, and a licensed vaccine has yet to be developed. The pilus of GAS is known to be involved in host cell adhesion, biofilm formation and immune evasion. We have a mucosal vaccine in development that expresses the pilus of GAS on the surface of the nonpathogenic bacterium Lactococcus lactis. To expand strain coverage, we combined seven L. lactis constructs, each expressing a different GAS pilus variant, and investigated the systemic and mucosal immune responses following immunization. Mice immunized with this combination showed specific immunoglobin G and immunoglobin A responses to the GAS pilus proteins of vaccine strains, at levels comparable to mice immunized with a single construct. Cross-reactivity to pilus proteins of nonvaccine strains was also evident. Furthermore, protective efficacy against a homologous strain of GAS in a murine nasopharyngeal colonization model was observed. Overall, this study provides further evidence for using pilus-expressing lactic acid bacteria as a vaccine to prevent upper respiratory tract GAS infections."

      "# Title: Comparisons of forward and backward gait between poorer and better attention capabilities in early Parkinson's disease.\n# Abstract: This study compared forward and backward gait between Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with poorer and better attention capabilities. PD and healthy control (HC) participants received a dual-stimuli attention task. The results were assessed using principal component analysis to quantify and rank attention capability. Accordingly, 22 PD and 42 HC subjects were equally divided into poorer (14 PD-P, 18 HC-P) and better (8 PD-B, 24 HC-B) attention capabilities. To analyze the spatiotemporal gait parameters, each participant walked forwards and backwards on a GAITRite(®) walkway. Compared to HC, PD performed worse in the dual task and exhibited slower velocity, less swing, and shorter stride in both walking directions. Notably, PD-P experienced all these gait defects, regardless of directions. PD-B walked worse than HC-B backwards, and displayed comparable gait to HC-P in both directions. In PD and HC, velocity, stride, and swing decreased perceptibly when walking backwards compared to forwards, and the same was true for velocity and stride in PD-P and PD-B. Backward strides were reduced evidently more in PD-P than in PD-B. However, backward swing reductions in PD-P and PD-B were statistically insignificant. Cadence in both directions was similar within the groups and between the groups, and there were little alterations between directions within each group and between groups. These results suggest that attention capability may affect PD gait. Poorer attention exacerbates gait defects and better attention improves gait in both directions. These results may support the application of cuing strategies in PD to enhance attention capability and improve walking gait.",
      "# Title: Investigation of factors impacting mobility and gait in Parkinson disease.\n# Abstract: Mobility and gait limitations are major issues for people with Parkinson disease (PD). Identification of factors that contribute to these impairments may inform treatment and intervention strategies. In this study we investigated factors that predict mobility and gait impairment in PD. Participants with mild to moderate PD and without dementia (n=114) were tested in one session 'off' medication. Mobility measures included the 6-Minute Walk test and Timed-Up-and-Go. Gait velocity was collected in four conditions: forward preferred speed, forward dual task, forward fast as possible and backward walking. The predictors analyzed were age, gender, disease severity, balance, balance confidence, fall history, self-reported physical activity, and executive function. Multiple regression models were used to assess the relationships between predictors and outcomes. The predictors, in different combinations for each outcome measure, explained 55.7% to 66.9% of variability for mobility and 39.5% to 52.8% for gait velocity. Balance was the most relevant factor (explaining up to 54.1% of variance in mobility and up to 45.6% in gait velocity). Balance confidence contributed to a lesser extent (2.0% to 8.2% of variance) in all models. Age explained a small percentage of variance in mobility and gait velocity (up to 2.9%). Executive function explained 3.0% of variance during forward walking only. The strong predictive relationships between balance deficits and mobility and gait impairment suggest targeting balance deficits may be particularly important for improving mobility and gait in people with PD, regardless of an individual's age, disease severity, fall history, or other demographic features."

The current study analyzed the clinical significance of this new stage in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Subjects and Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 4045 eligible PTC patients. The patients were divided into four groups according to the extent of ETE: no ETE, ETE into perithyroidal tissue, T3b (ETE into the strap muscles), and ETE beyond the strap muscles. Differences in the clinical characteristics and prognosis of the four groups were assessed. Results: Of these 4045 patients, 2300 (56.9%) had no ETE, 1004 (24.8%) had ETE into perithyroidal tissue, 371 (9.2%) had ETE into the strap muscles, and 370 (9.1%) had ETE beyond the strap muscles. Tumor size, multifocality, lymph node metastasis (LNM), distant metastasis (DM), recurrence, and recurrence-free survival (RFS) between patients with ETE into perithyroidal tissue and patients without ETE did not show differences, but significant differences were observed between patients with T3b and patients without ETE, and only patients with ETE beyond the strap muscles had significantly worse overall survival (OS) than the other three groups. However, T3b did not independently predict worse RFS in univariable and multivariable analyses. Conclusions: T3b, distinguished from minimal ETE, may be related to larger tumor size, higher prevalence of multifocality, LNM, DM, recurrence, and worse RFS than no ETE, but it may not affect OS and may not independently predict recurrence in PTC patients.",
      "# Title: Is There a Difference Between Minimal and Gross Extension into the Strap Muscles for the Risk of Recurrence in Papillary Thyroid Carcinomas?\n# Abstract: Background: The morbidity of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is primarily related to locoregional recurrences and distant metastases. The definition of minimal extrathyroidal extension (mETE) has been recently revised. The presence of mETE does not impact mortality and is generally not considered to be a predictor for the risk of recurrence. This study aimed at comparing the risk of recurrence and the response to therapy of PTC with mETE and gross extrathyroidal extension (ETE) into the strap muscles (gETE) with low- and intermediate-risk PTC without ETE (low risk w/o ETE and intermediate risk w/o ETE, respectively) to further characterize the impact of ETE on outcomes. Methods: A total of 596 PTCs were analyzed according to the degree of ETE as well as other predictors of recurrence. Four groups of patients were compared, low risk w/o ETE (n = 251), intermediate risk w/o ETE (n = 89), mETE (n = 191), and gETE (n = 65), to determine the risk of recurrence and the response to treatment. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate associations between groups and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: The risk of recurrence was 3% in low risk w/o ETE PTC, 14% in intermediate risk w/o ETE, 14% in mETE, and 25% in gETE. The recurrence risk was increased by the presence of ETE (odds ratio [OR] = 2.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-5.85, p = 0.005) and lymph node metastases (OR = 2.44 [95% CI 1.25-4.76], p = 0.009). Patients with low-risk carcinomas w/o ETE experienced longer DFS than those with mETE (hazard ratio = 0.08 [95% CI 0.02-0.28], p < 0.001), but no significant difference was observed between intermediate risk w/o ETE, mETE, and gETE. In terms of the response to therapy, patients with gETE had higher rates of biochemical and/or structural incomplete responses within the first year of treatment (OR = 2.68 [95% CI 1.31-5.45], p = 0.007) and at the final follow-up evaluation (OR = 4.35 [95% CI 1.99-9.51], p < 0.001) compared with those with mETE. An analysis of the subgroups of microcarcinomas without lymph node metastases revealed no significant difference in DFS or the response to therapy between the low risk w/o ETE and mETE PTC groups. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that both mETE and gETE are independent risk factors for the risk of recurrence in PTC. Although gETE has a more pronounced impact on the recurrence risk and is associated with a worse response to therapy, mETE may not be associated with a low risk of recurrence. This observation suggests that patients with PTC and mETE may, in part, have an intermediate risk of recurrence and need to be followed accordingly."

Alterations in the central nervous system also play a role, but their influence after injury, recovery, and recurrent injury remain unknown. Modern neuroimaging techniques can be used to elucidate the underlying functional and structural alterations of the brain that predicate the neuromuscular control adaptations associated with ACL injury. This knowledge will further our understanding of the neural adaptations after ACL injury and rehabilitation and in relation to injury risk.

      "# Title: Corticospinal and intracortical excitability differ between athletes early after ACLR and matched controls.\n# Abstract: Neuromuscular impairments, such as quadriceps weakness and activation deficits, persist after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Recent research demonstrating changes in the function of the primary motor cortex after ACLR posits that quadriceps impairments may be influenced by reduced corticospinal excitability. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the integrity of the neuromotor axis of the vastus medialis is altered in subjects 2 weeks post-ACLR compared to uninjured control subjects. Eighteen athletes 2 weeks post-ACLR and 18 age and sex matched uninjured control subjects participated in this cross-sectional study. We quantified corticospinal (resting motor threshold, RMT; motor evoked potential amplitudes at 120% RMT, MEP120 ) and intracortical (inhibition and facilitation) excitability using single and paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), respectively. We assessed spinal-reflex excitability (H-reflex amplitude normalized to maximal M-wave, H/M ratio) using peripheral stimulation. Subjects post-ACLR had higher RMTs (p = 0.001), greater MEP120 amplitudes (p = 0.001), and more asymmetric facilitation (p = 0.041) than the uninjured control subjects. No significant group differences were found for intracortical inhibition (p = 0.289) and H/M ratio (p = 0.332). Our findings indicate that both intracortical and corticospinal excitability of vastus medialis are bilaterally altered in subjects 2 weeks after ACLR. Given persistent neuromuscular deficits seen after ACLR, rehabilitation strategies targeting intracortical and corticospinal deficits may potentially improve clinical outcomes. © 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Data considering the diversity of neural changes, in-concert with morphological adaptations of the quadriceps muscle, are lacking. We investigated bilateral differences in neural and morphological characteristics of the quadriceps muscle in ACLR participants (n = 11, month post-surgery: 69.4 ± 22.4) compared to controls matched by sex, age, height, weight, limb dominance, and activity level. Spinal reflex excitability was assessed using Hoffmann reflexes (H:M); corticospinal excitability was quantified via active motor thresholds (AMT) and motor-evoked potentials (MEP) using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Cortical activation was assessed using a knee flexion/extension task with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Muscle volume was quantified using structural MRI. Muscle strength and patient-reported outcomes were also collected. 2 × 2 RM ANOVAs were used to evaluate group differences. Smaller quadriceps muscle volume (total volume, rectus femoris, vastus medialis, and intermedius) and lower strength were detected compared to contralateral and control limbs. Individuals with ACLR reported higher levels of pain and fear and lower levels of knee function compared to controls. No differences were observed for H:M. ACLR individuals demonstrated higher AMT bilaterally and smaller MEPs in the injured limb, compared to the controls. ACLR participants demonstrated greater activation in frontal lobe areas responsible for motor and pain processing compared to controls, which were associated with self-reported pain.

We aimed to assess relationships between quadriceps corticomotor and neuromechanical function after ACL surgery, and to compare with contralateral and control limbs. 16 individuals after primary, unilateral ACL surgery and 16 sex- and age-matched controls participated. Corticomotor function was assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation, and quantified via active motor thresholds (AMT), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF). Neuromechanical function was quantified via electromechanical delay, early and late-phase rate of torque development (RTD0-50, RTD100-200), coefficient of variation, maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) torque, and central activation ratio. We observed significant correlations in the ACL limbs between: AMT and RTD0-50 (r = - 0.513, p = 0.031), SICI and RTD100-200 (r = 0.501, p = 0.048), AMT and SICI (r = - 0.659, p = 0.010), AMT and ICF (r = 0.579, p = 0.031), RTD0-50 and MVIC (r = 0.504, p = 0.023), and RTD100-200 and MVIC (r = 0.680, p = 0.002). The ACL limbs demonstrated higher AMT compared to controls (44.9 ± 8.4 vs. 30.1 ± 8.2%, p < 0.001), and lesser MVIC torque (2.37 ± 0.52 vs. 2.80 ± 0.59 Nm/kg, p = 0.005) and RTD100-200 (6.79 ± 1.72 vs. 7.90 ± 1.98 Nm/kg/s, p = 0.006) compared to the contralateral limbs. Our findings indicate that lesser corticospinal excitability is associated with lesser early-phase RTD, and greater intracortical inhibition is associated with lesser late-phase RTD.

Inhibitory and facilitatory intracortical networks (ie, intracortical excitability) may be involved in quadriceps dysfunction, yet the investigation of these networks early after ACLR is sparse. The purposes of this study were to examine (a) changes in intracortical excitability in athletes after ACLR compared to uninjured athletes during the course of postoperative rehabilitation, (b) the association between intracortical excitability and quadriceps strength in athletes after ACLR. Eighteen level I/II athletes after ACLR between the ages of 18 to 30 years and eighteen healthy sex, age, and activity matched athletes were tested at three-time points: (a) 2 weeks after surgery, (b) achievement of a \"quiet knee\" defined as full range of motion and minimal effusion, (c) return to running time point defined as achievement of a quadriceps index ≥80% and at least 12 weeks post-ACLR. Short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF), measured via transcranial magnetic stimulation and isometric quadriceps strength were examined bilaterally at each time point. There was a significant group × limb interaction (P = .017) for ICF. The ACLR group demonstrated asymmetric ICF (greater in the nonsurgical limb) compared to controls and a significant relationship between SICI and quadriceps strength of the surgical limb at the quiet knee time point (P = .018). ACLR individuals demonstrate differential effects on ICF between limbs. Also, SICI is associated with isometric quadriceps strength after ACLR, suggesting increased inhibition of the motor cortex may contribute to impaired quadriceps strength following ACLR.",

      "# Title: Neural activity for hip-knee control in those with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A task-based functional connectivity analysis.\n# Abstract: Anterior cruciate ligament injury may induce neurophysiological changes for sensorimotor control. Neuroimaging investigations have revealed unique brain activity patterns for knee movement following injury, indicating potential neural mechanisms underlying aberrant neuromuscular control that may contribute to heightened risk of secondary injury, altered movement patterns and poor patient outcomes. However, neuroimaging paradigms thus far have been limited to single joint, single motion knee tasks. Therefore, we sought to overcome prior limitations to understand the effects of injury on neural control of lower extremity movement by employing a multi-joint motor paradigm and determining differences in neural activity between ACL-reconstructed (ACLr) individuals relative to healthy matched controls. Fifteen patients with left anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and fifteen matched healthy controls participated in this study. Neural activity was examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging during a block-designed knee-hip movement paradigm (similar to a supine heel-slide). Participants for each group were monitored and task performance was controlled via a metronome to ensure the same spatial-temporal parameters. We observed that those with ACL reconstruction displayed increased activation within the intracalcarine cortex, lingual gyrus, occipital fusiform gyrus, lateral occipital cortex, angular gyrus, and superior parietal lobule relative to controls. A follow-up task-based functional connectivity analyses using seed regions identified from the group analysis revealed connectivity among fronto-insular-temporal and sensorimotor regions within the ACLr participants. The results of this fMRI investigation suggest ACLr individuals require increased activity and connectivity in areas responsible for visual-spatial cognition and orientation, and attention for hip and knee motor control."

      "# Title: Cytological diagnostic features of late breast implant seromas: From reactive to anaplastic large cell lymphoma.\n# Abstract: Late breast implant seroma may be the presentation of a breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BI-ALCL), which claims for a prompt recognition. However, BI-ALCL diagnosis on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) might be challenging for pathologists lacking experience with peri-implant breast effusions. Sixty-seven late breast implant seromas collected by FNA from 50 patients were evaluated by Papanicolaou smear stain and immunocytochemistry on cell blocks. A diagnostic algorithm based on the cellular composition, cell morphology and percentage of CD30+ cells was developed. Histological evaluation of the corresponding peri-prosthetic capsules was also performed. Most of the effusions (91% of the samples) were classified as reactive and 9% as BI-ALCL. In the BI-ALCL cases, medium-to-large atypical cells expressing CD30 represented more than 70% of the cellularity, whereas in in the reactive effusions CD30+ elements were extremely rare (<5%) and consisted of non-atypical elements. The reactive effusions were categorized into three patterns: i) acute infiltrate with prominent neutrophilic component (33% of the samples); ii) mixed infiltrate characterized by a variable number of neutrophils, lymphocytes and macrophages (30% of the samples); iii) chronic infiltrate composed predominantly of T lymphocytes or macrophages with only sporadic granulocytes (37% of the samples). The inflammatory cytological patterns were consistent with the histology of the corresponding capsules. Our results indicate that cytological analysis of late breast implant effusions, supported by the knowledge of the heterogeneous cytomorphological spectrum of late seromas, is a valuable approach for the early recognition of BI-ALCL.",
      "# Title: Insights into the Microbiome of Breast Implants and Periprosthetic Tissue in Breast Implant-Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma.\n# Abstract: Though rare, breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), a CD30+ T-cell lymphoma associated with textured breast implants, has adversely impacted our perception of the safety of breast implants. Its etiology unknown, one hypothesis suggests an initiating inflammatory stimulus, possibly infectious, triggers BIA-ALCL. We analyzed microbiota of breast, skin, implant and capsule in BIA-ALCL patients (n = 7), and controls via culturing methods, 16S rRNA microbiome sequencing, and immunohistochemistry. Alpha and beta diversity metrics and relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria were calculated, and phylogenetic trees constructed. Staphylococcus spp., the most commonly cultured microbes, were identified in both the BIA-ALCL and contralateral control breast. The diversity of bacterial microbiota did not differ significantly between BIA-ALCL and controls for any material analyzed. Further, there were no significant differences in the relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria between BIA-ALCL and control specimens. Heat maps suggested substantial diversity in the composition of the bacterial microbiota of the skin, breast, implant and capsule between patients with no clear trend to distinguish BIA-ALCL from controls. While we identified no consistent differences between patients with BIA-ALCL-affected and contralateral control breasts, this study provides insights into the composition of the breast microbiota in this population.",

      "# Title: Gram-Negative Bacterial Lipopolysaccharide Promotes Tumor Cell Proliferation in Breast Implant-Associated Anaplastic Large-Cell Lymphoma.\n# Abstract: Breast implant-associated anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) is a distinct malignancy associated with textured breast implants. We investigated whether bacteria could trigger the activation and multiplication of BIA-ALCL cells in vitro. BIA-ALCL patient-derived BIA-ALCL tumor cells, BIA-ALCL cell lines, cutaneous ALCL cell lines, an immortal T-cell line (MT-4), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from BIA-ALCL, capsular contracture, and primary augmentation patients were studied. Cells were subjected to various mitogenic stimulation assays including plant phytohemagglutinin (PHA), Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Staphylococcal superantigens enterotoxin A (SEA), toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), or sterilized implant shells. Patient-derived BIA-ALCL tumor cells and BIA-ALCL cell lines showed a unique response to LPS stimulation. This response was dampened significantly in the presence of a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) inhibitor peptide. In contrast, cutaneous ALCL cells, MT-4, and PBMC cells from all patients responded significantly more to PHA, SEA, and TSST-1 than to LPS. Breast implant shells of all surface grades alone did not produce a proliferative response of BIA-ALCL cells, indicating the breast implant does not act as a pro-inflammatory stimulant. These findings indicate a possible novel pathway for LPS to promote BIA-ALCL cell proliferation via a TLR4 receptor-mediated bacterial transformation of T-cells into malignancy."

      "# Title: Thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications in essential thrombocythemia. A retrospective study of 103 patients.\n# Abstract: A retrospective study of 103 patients with essential thrombocythemia was carried out to evaluate the incidence of thrombohemorrhagic complications and establish whether there were any correlations between these events and clinical or laboratory data. At onset or during the course of the disease, 26 patients (25.2%) presented thrombotic and 12 (11.6%) hemorrhagic complications: among the latter, six patients had gastrointestinal bleeding during antiaggregant therapy. No significant correlations were observed between thrombohemorrhagic complications and platelet count, age, sex, platelet function, bleeding time, or therapeutic regimen. However, there was a statistically significant correlation between a positive patient history for thrombotic events and an increase in thromboses. In agreement with other authors, it is believed that the best approach in asymptomatic patients is strict surveillance without treatment. Chemotherapy and/or treatment with antiaggregant agents should be reserved for symptomatic patients or patients with a positive history for thrombotic events.",
      "# Title: Clinical course of essential thrombocythemia in 147 cases.\n# Abstract: The authors retrospectively analyzed the initial characteristics, treatment, and clinical course in 147 patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET). Median age was 60 years and the M:F ratio was 0.69. At diagnosis, 53 patients were asymptomatic; 50 patients had functional symptoms (mainly vasomotor disturbances); 27 patients had large vessel thrombosis; 27 patients had a bleeding diathesis; and seven patients had both bleeding and thrombosis. The platelet count ranged from 0.7 to 2.92 X 10(12)/l. Forty-five of the 61 tested patients (61%) had prolonged bleeding time and/or platelet hypoaggregation. Three patients had in vitro spontaneous aggregation. No significant correlations were found between hemostatic findings and in vivo bleeding or thrombosis. The incidence of bleeding, however, was higher in patients with more than 2 x 10(12)/l platelets. Of 87 karyotypes performed with banding techniques, only four were abnormal. One hundred twenty-nine patients received one or more cytoreductive agents at diagnosis or during follow-up. Sixty patients received an antiaggregating agent. First-line therapy was radiophosphorus (32P) in 22 patients; busulfan in 35 patients; and hydroxyurea in 72 patients. Hydroxyurea required continuous maintenance therapy and had to be changed to another treatment in 12 of the initial responders because of inadequate control of thrombocythemia. During follow-up, 14 treated patients experienced one or several major thrombotic events. Two untreated patients also had major thrombosis. Only one major bleeding event was seen during follow-up. Median actuarial survival was 73.5% at 7 years and only one patient progressed to acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). These results suggest that large vessel thrombosis is the main complication of ET. It appears largely unpredictable in a given patient at diagnosis but can be largely prevented by the control of thrombocythemia. Because of the low incidence of side effects of treatment in this experience, the authors believe that cytoreductive therapy is indicated in most patients with ET, as long as a group of patients with very low risk of thrombosis is not defined in prospective studies.",
      "# Title: Major vascular complications in essential thrombocythemia: a study of the predictive factors in a series of 148 patients.\n# Abstract: To determine the clinicohematological factors predictive for the appearance of major vascular complications (MVC) in patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET), 148 consecutive such patients were retrospectively assessed for the development of MVC during a median follow-up of 58.5 months. Seventy-seven patients had vascular risk factors, and 37 a history of MVC at ET diagnosis. Forty-nine MVC were registered in 33 patients during the follow-up period. The actuarial probability of MVC was 27% at 6 years in the whole series, 35.6% for patients above 60 years, and 21.4% for patients younger than 60 years, whereas only one of the 36 patients younger than 45 years had MVC. At multivariate analysis, age >60 years, history of major ischemia and hypercholesterolemia were the variables associated with an increased MVC risk. These results suggest that all ET patients above 60 years should be treated, whereas in younger patients treatment decisions should be primarily based on the existence of risk factors for MVC.",
      "# Title: Thrombosis and bleeding in myeloproliferative disorders: identification of at-risk patients with whole blood platelet aggregation studies.\n# Abstract: Seventy-five patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders were studied to investigate platelet function by simultaneous measurement of platelet aggregation by the impedance method and ATP dense granule release using a whole blood platelet lumi-aggregometer, in an attempt to identify patients at risk for thrombosis and bleeding. Thirty-nine patients had at least one abnormal result indicating platelet hyperactivity (i.e. impedance or release with one agonist being above the reference range); 16 patients had platelet hypoactivity (i.e. at least one result was below the reference range), whilst 14 had co-existence of hyper- and hypoactivity. Six patients had normal results. 20/53 patients with platelet hyperactivity (alone or mixed) had a positive history of venous and/or arterial thrombosis; in comparison, only two of the other 22 patients had a positive history. During a median follow-up of 33 months, nine patients with and one patient without platelet hyperactivity respectively developed new thrombotic events before the addition of specific therapy. A total of 50 patients with and eight patients without platelet hyperactivity respectively received specific treatment including aspirin and/or cytotoxic therapy. All but one elderly patient with platelet hyperactivity have remained free of new thrombotic events on specific therapy. Two of the 17 patients with platelet hypoactivity had major clinical bleeding. These observations highlight the need to test platelets for hyper- as well as hypo-function and suggest a useful role for routine whole blood platelet aggregation studies to identify the patients at risk for thrombosis or bleeding.",
      "# Title: Incidence, clinical features and outcome of essential thrombocythaemia in a well defined geographical area.\n# Abstract: In an attempt to characterise the clinical features, incidence and outcome of essential thrombocythaemia (ET) we report our experience in a large unselected series of patients from a well defined region. All new cases of ET in the County of Copenhagen were registered during the period 1977-98. We identified 96 cases of ET, yielding an age- and sex-adjusted annual incidence rate of 0.59/100.000 and a point-prevalence at last follow up of 11/100.000. The overall incidence rate was 0.31 and 1.00 per 100.000 population during the consecutive periods 1977-89 and 1990-98, respectively, corresponding to a 3.2-fold increase. Median age at diagnosis was 67 yr (females 68 yr, males 66 yr, range 18-87 yr), and the female to male (F/M) ratio was 2.6:1. At diagnosis, 52% of the patients displayed no ET-related symptoms and were discovered fortuitously by a routine platelet count. Forty-eight percent presented with thrombohaemorrhagic phenomena, of which microvascular disturbances of the central nervous system (CNS), extremities and skin were most frequently observed (23%). Compared to patients diagnosed after 1989, patients diagnosed before 1990 had a significantly higher mean platelet count, white blood cell (WBC) count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) value and alkaline phosphatase value. With a median follow up of 70 months, 5-yr survival was 76%, significantly lower than the expected survival of an age- and sex-matched control group (p = 0.0052). Thirty-seven patients experienced a total of 55 thrombohaemorrhagic events during follow-up, corresponding to an incidence of thrombosis and microvascular disturbances or haemorrhage of 8.1% per pt-yr and 2.5% per pt-yr, respectively. The number of patients experiencing thrombosis or microvascular disturbances was significantly higher among the 29 patients who never received acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) compared to the 67 patients who received ASA during follow up (45% vs. 21%; p = 0.017). This study provides population-based data suggesting the benefit of treatment with low-dose ASA in a non-selected population of patients with ET.",

      "# Title: Frequency and risk factors for thrombosis in idiopathic myelofibrosis: analysis in a series of 155 patients from a single institution.\n# Abstract: Thrombosis is a frequent complication of polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia, but its incidence and predisposing factors in idiopathic myelofibrosis (IM) are unknown. In 18 (11.6%) of 155 patients diagnosed with IM in a single institution, 31 thrombotic events (19 arterial, 12 venous) were registered after a mean follow-up of 4.2 (s.d.: 4.5) years. In six patients, the thrombosis was simultaneous to or appeared a few months before IM diagnosis and 14 had one or more thrombotic episodes. When compared with the general population, a significant increase was observed in the incidence of venous thrombosis (odds ratio 17.5, 95% confidence interval: 10.3-31.4). At multivariate analysis, the initial variables associated with an increased risk of thrombosis were thrombocytosis (platelets >450 x 10(9)/l, P=0.001), presence of one cardiovascular risk factor (arterial hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes, P=0.003), cellular phase of myelofibrosis (P=0.005), and Hb >11 g/dl (P=0.02). Considering post-diagnosis events, the 5-year thrombosis-free survival probability was 90.4% in the series, 80.6% for patients with platelets >450 x 10(9)/l, 82.6% for patients with one cardiovascular risk factor, and 85.1% for those in cellular phase. These results indicate an increased thrombotic risk for IM patients with hyperproliferative features and/or coexistent cardiovascular risk factors.",

      "# Title: Leukocytosis is a risk factor for thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia: interaction with treatment, standard risk factors, and Jak2 mutation status.\n# Abstract: Leukocytes contribute to the pathogenesis of thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia (ET) through recently discovered mechanisms of activation and interaction with platelets and endothelial cells. To evaluate whether an increased leukocyte count was associated with thrombosis and whether this effect can be modulated by therapy, we analyzed the clinical course of 439 patients with ET followed at the Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo. The strength of the association was measured at diagnosis or before thrombotic events by multivariable analyses carried out using data at baseline as well as time-varying covariates. The results showed that (1) an increased leukocyte count at diagnosis was associated with thrombosis during follow-up (\"baseline analysis,\" relative risk [RR] 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-3.9, P = .001); (2) hydroxyurea (HU) lowered leukocytosis and reduced the strength of the association between leukocytosis and thrombosis (\"time-dependent analysis,\" RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.9-2.0, not significant [NS]); (3) the association of leukocytosis and thrombosis was more evident in untreated low-risk patients (RR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-6.4, P = .01) compared with HU-treated high-risk patients (RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.8-3.2, NS); and (4) the presence of JAK2 V617F was not identified as a risk factor for thrombosis during follow-up despite a significant association between the mutation and leukocytosis. We suggest validation of these findings in prospective clinical studies.",
      "# Title: Clinical profile of homozygous JAK2 617V>F mutation in patients with polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia.\n# Abstract: JAK2 617V>F mutation occurs in a homozygous state in 25% to 30% of patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and 2% to 4% with essential thrombocythemia (ET). Whether homozygosity associates with distinct clinical phenotypes is still under debate. This retrospective multicenter study considered 118 JAK2 617V>F homozygous patients (104 PV, 14 ET) whose clinical characteristics were compared with those of 587 heterozygous and 257 wild-type patients. Irrespective of their clinical diagnosis, homozygous patients were older, displayed a higher leukocyte count and hematocrit value at diagnosis, and presented larger spleen volume. Aquagenic pruritus was significantly more common among homozygous PV patients. JAK2 617V>F homozygosity associated with more frequent evolution into secondary myelofibrosis in both PV and ET. After adjustment for sex, age, leukocyte count, and previous thrombosis in a multivariate analysis, homozygous ET patients displayed a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio [HR] 3.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-11.7; P = .013) than wild-type (HR = 1.0) or heterozygous patients (HR = 1.49). No significant association of JAK2 617V>F homozygosity with thrombosis risk was observed in PV. Finally, JAK2 617V>F homozygous patients were more likely to receive chemotherapy for control of disease. We conclude that JAK2 617V>F homozygosity identifies PV or ET patients with a more symptomatic myeloproliferative disorder and is associated with a higher risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with ET.",
      "# Title: Vascular events in Korean patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and their relationship to JAK2 mutation.\n# Abstract: Evaluation of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F mutation has been widely used for the diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). However, its prognostic relevance to clinical outcome is not completely understood. We investigated the association of JAK2 V617F with vascular events in Korean patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). We studied 283 patients from 15 centers, who were diagnosed with MPN. The JAK2 V617F status was evaluated by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. The patients' diagnoses were essential thrombocythemia (ET n = 146), polycythemia vera (PV n = 120), primary myelofibrosis (n = 12), and unclassifiable MPN (MPNu n = 5). JAK2 V617F was detected in 89 (61%) patients with ET, 103 (86%) with PV, four (33%) with myelofibrosis, and four (80%) with MPNu. A higher number of leukocytes, haemoglobin levels and BM cellularity as well as an older age, lower platelet counts, and diagnosis of PV were significantly correlated with JAK2 V617F. Eighty-three and 43 episodes of thrombosis and bleeding occurred in 100 patients each before and after the diagnosis. Vascular events more frequently occurred in 37% of patients with JAK2 V617F than in 29% of those without the mutation (p = 0.045). Among 175 patients whose samples were available for sequencing, 28 patients with homozygous JAK2 V617F had vascular events more frequently (57%) than those who were heterozygotes (39%) or had the wild type (27%) (p = 0.03). The multivariate analysis showed that a JAK2 homozygous mutation, hypercholesterolemia and older age were independent risk factors for a vascular event. The results of this study showed that Korean patients with MPN had a similar JAK2 mutation rate and frequency of vascular events when compared to Western patients. The presence of V617F was significantly related to vascular events. Therefore, initial evaluation for the JAK2 mutation and careful monitoring for vascular events should be performed in MPN patients.",
      "# Title: Thrombosis in primary myelofibrosis: incidence and risk factors.\n# Abstract: We assessed frequency and predictive factors for major cardiovascular (CV) events in 707 patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) followed in 4 European institutions. A total of 236 deaths (33%) were recorded for an overall mortality of 7.7% patient-years (pt-yr). Fatal and nonfatal thromboses were registered in 51 (7.2%) patients, with a rate of 1.75% pt-yr. If deaths from non-CV causes were considered as competing events, we estimated that the adjusted rate of major thrombotic events would have been 2.2% pt-yr. In a multivariable model, age older than 60 years (hazard ratio [HR], 2.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-4.39, P = .01) and JAK2 mutational status (HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.10-3.34; P = .02) were significantly associated with thrombosis, whereas the strength of the association between leukocyte count higher than 15 x 10(9)/L and CV events was of borderline significance (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 0.97-2.72; P = .06). The highest incidence of fatal and nonfatal thrombosis was observed when the mutation was present along with leukocytosis (3.9% pt-yr; HR, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.26-7.81). This study is the largest hitherto carried out in this setting and shows that the rate of major CV events in PMF is comparable with that reported in essential thrombocythemia, and it is increased in aged patients and those with JAK2 V617F mutation and leukocytosis.",
      "# Title: Thrombosis in myelofibrosis: prior thrombosis is the only predictive factor and most venous events are provoked.\n# Abstract: In a retrospective analysis of 205 patients (median age 62 years) with primary myelofibrosis and known JAK2V617F mutational status, 13.2% experienced a vaso-occlusive event at or prior to their diagnosis. After a median follow up of 31 months, post-diagnosis thrombosis occurred in 22 patients (10.7%), including 9 (4.4%) and 16 (7.8%) patients with a total of 9 arterial and 24 venous events, respectively. The majority (71%) of the venous events were temporally associated with other exogenous risk factors for thrombosis such as surgery, line placement or hormonal therapy. On multivariable analysis that included age, JAK2V617F mutation status and leukocyte count as covariates, history of thrombosis was the only predictive variable in general (P=0.04) or when arterial (P=0.007) and venous (P=0.02) thromboses were analyzed separately. The current study demonstrates a higher prevalence of venous, as opposed to arterial, events in PMF, post-diagnosis, and clarifies their nature as being mostly provoked.",
      "# Title: Impact of leukocytosis on thrombotic risk and survival in 532 patients with essential thrombocythemia: a retrospective study.\n# Abstract: Established risk factors for thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia (ET) include age (≥ 60 years) and previous vascular events. Recently, also leukocytosis has been proposed in risk stratification of ET patients. We report a retrospective study on 532 ET patients followed for a median of 7.6 years. Sixty-four patients (12%) developed 95 thrombotic events during follow-up. Together with the high-risk condition, a white blood cell (WBC) value above 11 × 10⁹/L, corresponding to the fourth percentile value, significantly correlated with a higher thrombotic risk (p = 0.033) by Cox proportional hazards. Moreover, the cumulative risk of thrombosis was significantly higher in high-risk patients with WBC >11 × 10⁹/L. JAK2 V617F mutation did not correlate with thrombosis. Overall, 123 (23%) patients died. Three independent parameters were noted as prognostic factors for survival in multivariate analysis: age > 60 years, leukocytosis >11 × 10⁹/L, and hemoglobin level below normal values. Based on these parameters, three groups of risk were defined, with significantly different survivals. Baseline leukocytosis correlated with a higher thrombotic risk in high-risk patients and identified a cohort of patients with worse survival.",
      "# Title: Incidence and risk factors for bleeding in 1104 patients with essential thrombocythemia or prefibrotic myelofibrosis diagnosed according to the 2008 WHO criteria.\n# Abstract: In an international study of 1104 patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET), a histological review according to the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria confirmed ET in 891 patients (WHO-ET, 81%), and revised the diagnosis to prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis (PMF) in 180 patients (PMF, 16%). Major bleeding during follow-up occurred in 55 (6%) WHO-ET and 21 (12%) PMF patients (P = 0.009), at a rate of 0.79 and 1.39% patients per year, respectively, (P = 0.039). In a multivariable analysis, predictors of bleeding included diagnosis of PMF (P = 0.05; hazard ratio (HR) 1.74), leukocytosis (P = 0.04; HR 1.74), previous hemorrhage (P = 0.025; HR 2.35) and aspirin therapy (P=0.001; HR 3.16). The analysis restricted to patients with WHO-ET confirmed previous hemorrhage (P = 0.043; HR 1.92) and aspirin (P=0.027; HR 2.24) as independent risk factors. The current study reveals that major bleeding associated with thrombocytosis might be relatively specific to PMF, as opposed to WHO-defined ET. Furthermore, it shows that low-dose aspirin exacerbates these hemorrhagic events of PMF. In contrast, thrombocytosis per se was not a risk factor for bleeding; however, low-dose aspirin had a synergistic hemorrhagic effect unmasking the bleeding tendency of patients with extreme thrombocytosis. These observations carry significant therapeutic implications in these two WHO entities.",
      "# Title: Leukocytosis as an important risk factor for arterial thrombosis in WHO-defined early/prefibrotic myelofibrosis: an international study of 264 patients.\n# Abstract: We aimed to determine risk factors for thrombotic events in early/prefibrotic myelofibrosis diagnosed according to the World Health Organization criteria. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was calculated on a total number of 264 patients derived from an international database. After a median follow-up of 6.28 years, 42 (15.9%) patients experienced arterial (n = 31) or venous thrombosis (n = 11). A higher leukocyte count correlated with an increased risk for total thrombosis and in particular, with an increased risk for arterial thrombosis (P = 0.005, HR 1.15 and P = 0.047, HR 1.12, respectively). A platelet count above 870 × 10⁹/L was associated with a lower risk for total thrombosis and also for venous thrombosis (P = 0.022, HR 0.44 and P = 0.027, HR 0.19). Moreover, a lower hemoglobin level was associated with an increased risk for venous thrombosis (P = 0.007, HR 0.59). Our data indicate that leukocytosis is a prominent risk factor for thrombosis in early/prefibrotic MF.",

Due to the morbidity and mortality of these events, antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant agents are commonly employed as primary and/or secondary prophylaxis. On the other hand, disease-related bleeding complications (i.e., from esophageal varices) are common in patients with MPN.

      "# Title: Thromboses and hemorrhages are common in MPN patients with high JAK2V617F allele burden.\n# Abstract: The most common causes of morbidity and mortality in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications. The JAK2V617F mutation, commonly found in MPN, correlates with several clinical and laboratory characteristics even if the relevance of JAK2V617F allele burden in the natural history of these diseases is unclear. In this study we searched, a relation between thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications and JAK2V617F allele burden level in MPN patients. We evaluated 253 consecutive MPN [121 essential thrombocythemia (ET), 124 polycythemia vera (PV), and 8 primary myelofibrosis (PMF)] patients in whom the JAK2V617F allele burden was available, all studied and followed (median 8.8 years) in our department. Patients were stratified accordingly to their JAK2V617F allele burden, into four quartiles (1st <25%, 2nd 26-50%, 3rd 51-75%, and 4th >75%). Significantly higher incidence of thromboses (p = 0.001) and hemorrhages (p < 0.001) during follow-up has been observed in higher quartiles when compared to lower ones. Thrombosis- and hemorrhage-free survivals were poorer in patients belonging to the highest quartile. Our data suggest that MPN patients with JAK2V617F allele burden higher than 75% have to be considered as high risk patients, being prone to develop thrombo-hemorrhagic complications during the disease course.",
      "# Title: Risk factors for arterial versus venous thrombosis in polycythemia vera: a single center experience in 587 patients.\n# Abstract: In a recent International Working Group on Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) study, prior arterial events and hypertension were predictors of subsequent arterial thrombosis whereas prior venous events and age ≥65 years predicted venous thrombosis in polycythemia vera (PV). In the current study, we sought to validate the above findings and identify additional predictors of arterial versus venous thrombosis. At a median follow up of 109 months, thrombosis after diagnosis occurred in 128 (22%) patients; 82 (14%) arterial and 57 (10%) venous events. On multivariate analysis, prior arterial events (<0.0001), hyperlipidemia (p = 0.03), and hypertension (p = 0.02) predicted subsequent arterial events. In comparison, prior venous events (p = 0.05), leukocytosis ≥11 × 109/L (p = 0.002), and major hemorrhage (p = 0.02) were predictors of subsequent venous events. Salient associations with arterial thrombosis included age ≥ 60 years, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and normal karyotype whereas age ≤ 60 years, females, palpable splenomegaly and history of major hemorrhage were associated with venous thrombosis. TET2 or ASXL1 mutations did not impact arterial nor venous thrombosis. In conclusion, we identify distinct associations for arterial versus venous thrombosis in PV and confirm that a prior arterial or venous thrombotic event is the most reliable predictor of subsequent events.",
      "# Title: Evaluation of vascular events in patients with myeloproliferative syndromes and mutations of either the januskinase-2 or calreticulin gene at the university hospital Krems from 2008 to 2015.\n# Abstract: Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), classified as polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis (ET) and myelofibrosis (MF) are stem-cell derived disorders. Mutations in either the januskinase-2 (JAK-2) or the calreticulin (CALR) gene are characteristic for MPN and may result in enhanced proliferation of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets, and thus increase the risk for vascular events. This study is a retrospective and descriptive analysis of records of patients, who underwent treatment for myeloproliferative syndromes at the Department of Hemato-Oncology of the University hospital Krems from 2008 to the end of 2015. Out of 250 patients, who were suspected for MPN, 51 patients displayed a JAK-2 V617F mutation. These were analyzed with regard to their blood values, gender, age at diagnosis, therapy and vascular events before and after diagnosis (during therapy). Of the 51 patients diagnosed with MPN and a JAK-2 V617F mutation, 33 suffered from PV, 15 from ET and 3 from MF. More men than women were diagnosed with MPN and the median age at diagnosis was 72 years. Acetylsalicylic acid, phlebotomy and Hydroxyurea were the most frequent therapies applied. In our study cohort, the most common vascular events were acute coronary syndrome and transitory ischemic attack. Thromboembolic events were effectively reduced by MPN therapy while no elevation in bleeding events could be observed.",
      "# Title: Clinico-hematological profile and thrombotic/hemorrhagic events in 150 chinese patients with essential thrombocythemia.\n# Abstract: Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is an uncommon chronic myeloproliferative disorder with no cure. Patients with ET are at risk of different complications, and currently there are no optimal prognostic standards to predict severe post-diagnosis complications such as thrombosis and hemorrhage. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the full set of clinical data from 150 Chinese patients with ET enrolled from 2013 to 2016. We discovered that neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), along with other known clinical parameters such as age, leukocyte count, incidence of thrombotic events is higher in patients with JAK2 V617F mutation. NLR is also higher in patients at high-risk stratification of thrombosis. Multivariate analysis showed that age (P = 0.001, 95% CI 1.023-1.089) and JAK2 V617F mutation (P = 0.003, 95% CI 1.837-21.035) were independent factors for thrombotic events, while age (P = 0.005, 95% CI 1.019-1.111) was the only predictive factor for hemorrhagic events at diagnosis. For future thrombotic events, multivariate analysis revealed NLR as the best predictive parameter (P < 0.001, 95% CI 1.173-1.486) when compared with other clinical parameters such as age (P = 0.037, 95% CI 1.004-1.126), thrombosis at diagnosis (P = 0.036, 95% CI 1.077-9.099) and WBC count (P = 0.047, 95% CI 1.001-1.109). Further ROC curve and Kaplan Meier analysis validated NLR as better prognostic marker for future thrombotic events and thrombosis-free survival. In summary, our data suggest that NLR parameter may possess great prognostic significance for future thrombosis in ET patients."

      "# Title: Comparisons of forward and backward gait between poorer and better attention capabilities in early Parkinson's disease.\n# Abstract: This study compared forward and backward gait between Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with poorer and better attention capabilities. PD and healthy control (HC) participants received a dual-stimuli attention task. The results were assessed using principal component analysis to quantify and rank attention capability. Accordingly, 22 PD and 42 HC subjects were equally divided into poorer (14 PD-P, 18 HC-P) and better (8 PD-B, 24 HC-B) attention capabilities. To analyze the spatiotemporal gait parameters, each participant walked forwards and backwards on a GAITRite(®) walkway. Compared to HC, PD performed worse in the dual task and exhibited slower velocity, less swing, and shorter stride in both walking directions. Notably, PD-P experienced all these gait defects, regardless of directions. PD-B walked worse than HC-B backwards, and displayed comparable gait to HC-P in both directions. In PD and HC, velocity, stride, and swing decreased perceptibly when walking backwards compared to forwards, and the same was true for velocity and stride in PD-P and PD-B. Backward strides were reduced evidently more in PD-P than in PD-B. However, backward swing reductions in PD-P and PD-B were statistically insignificant. Cadence in both directions was similar within the groups and between the groups, and there were little alterations between directions within each group and between groups. These results suggest that attention capability may affect PD gait. Poorer attention exacerbates gait defects and better attention improves gait in both directions. These results may support the application of cuing strategies in PD to enhance attention capability and improve walking gait.",
      "# Title: Investigation of factors impacting mobility and gait in Parkinson disease.\n# Abstract: Mobility and gait limitations are major issues for people with Parkinson disease (PD). Identification of factors that contribute to these impairments may inform treatment and intervention strategies. In this study we investigated factors that predict mobility and gait impairment in PD. Participants with mild to moderate PD and without dementia (n=114) were tested in one session 'off' medication. Mobility measures included the 6-Minute Walk test and Timed-Up-and-Go. Gait velocity was collected in four conditions: forward preferred speed, forward dual task, forward fast as possible and backward walking. The predictors analyzed were age, gender, disease severity, balance, balance confidence, fall history, self-reported physical activity, and executive function. Multiple regression models were used to assess the relationships between predictors and outcomes. The predictors, in different combinations for each outcome measure, explained 55.7% to 66.9% of variability for mobility and 39.5% to 52.8% for gait velocity. Balance was the most relevant factor (explaining up to 54.1% of variance in mobility and up to 45.6% in gait velocity). Balance confidence contributed to a lesser extent (2.0% to 8.2% of variance) in all models. Age explained a small percentage of variance in mobility and gait velocity (up to 2.9%). Executive function explained 3.0% of variance during forward walking only. The strong predictive relationships between balance deficits and mobility and gait impairment suggest targeting balance deficits may be particularly important for improving mobility and gait in people with PD, regardless of an individual's age, disease severity, fall history, or other demographic features."

      "# Title: What determines and are the consequences of surveillance intensity after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair?\n# Abstract: Follow-up examinations are advised 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months and yearly thereafter by the European Collaborating Group on Stent-Graft Techniques for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair (EUROSTAR). The aim of this study was to evaluate the determinants and consequences of surveillance completeness. Patients who underwent endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair between October 1996 and August 2004 and enrolled in the EUROSTAR registry were analyzed. Two groups were compared: patients who attended all scheduled visits (group A) and those who came infrequently (group B). Odds ratios and hazard rates (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined to detect which patient characteristics and complications were associated with follow-up intensity. Of the 4,433 patients, 1,538 (35%) attended all scheduled visits until the end of follow-up (group A). Analysis of patient characteristics demonstrated that intensive visitors were more often smokers, hyperlipemic, and considered unfit for open surgery or general anesthesia. Complications during follow-up, including endoleaks (24% vs. 20%), kinking (3.5% vs. 2.5%), and migration (4.9% vs. 3.5%), appeared significantly more frequently in group A. Despite intensive follow-up of this category, still a greater proportion died (12% vs. 9%, adjusted HR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.8). After 84 months of follow-up, the cumulative survival rates in groups A and B were 71% and 74%, respectively (p < 0.0001). It seems that follow-up intensity was based on baseline patient characteristics. High-risk patients had, despite more intensive surveillance, still more complications after adjustment for patient, morphological, and center-specific characteristics. Further assessment is indicated to evaluate the effectiveness of different frequencies of surveillance visits.",
